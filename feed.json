				"content_html": "<p>Yesterday, I was sitting with my iPad Mini on the sunny balcony, with my sister&rsquo;s iPhone and my Galaxy S24 Ultra next to me. Barely able to read on my iPad, I picked up my phone and was reminded how I had fallen absolutely in love with this device. Especially the two aspects. The stunning screen. The monstrous battery life.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think I have seen <strong>a better screen</strong> than what this has. All reviews have called it out. But you must experience it to appreciate the brilliance of what Samsung has achieved. The text is crisp; the colours pop out. Plus, the lack of reflection is mindblowing. I don&rsquo;t think I can go back to any other device now that doesn&rsquo;t have the technical wizardry that Samsung has packaged here. It&rsquo;s perfectly visible even in the harshest sunlight without losing clarity or colour.</p>\n<p>I am surprised no one built such a screen earlier. This is much more important than the high refresh rate or crazy resolutions. Here&rsquo;s a snapshot from <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s24-ultra/\">the official product page</a>.﻿</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>﻿The second one is also a no-brainer with its trade-off &ndash; <strong>the battery life</strong>. Since moving to smartphones in 2009 with the iPhone 3GS, I haven&rsquo;t had any phone with a battery life longer than a day. But then I also stubbornly preferred phones with smaller dimensions. I never liked the likes of Notes and Plueses and Pros and Maxes. So, my decision to shift to a large phone this time was clouded by my fear of discomfort.</p>\n<p>All my fears were washed away right on the second day when my phone wasn&rsquo;t screaming at me to be plugged in. My last phone, the Galaxy S22, was the slickest of all the devices I have ever owned. But it was frustrating to put it to charging every evening. From that to now, when I am easily going through two full days without charging my phone, it is a drastic (and welcome) change. <em>Even three days once</em>. This might be a benefit that all large phones share. But with everything this device packs, it has to be the best amongst the best.</p>\n<p>Even without the natural benefit of a larger screen to read and write better, I would always select a larger phone from now on just for the battery life it lends.</p>\n<p>In addition, there are miscellaneous benefits of Samsung&rsquo;s versions of Android phones for me. They have been nailing the physical design of the phones for the past few years. Without all the gloss, they look and feel premium in hand. Everyone who has held this device has commended the richness of its feel.</p>\n<p>One UI feels slick, elevating the overall Android experience a notch higher. It&rsquo;s inherently Google but distinctly Samsung at the same time. All the small touches they add across the platform are well thought through. The ones that I have found the most used are <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00083201/\">Modes and Routines</a>. It helps set your phone for different phases of the day. I can customize all aspects, the most important being which apps I access during a particular mode. For example, in Life mode, I have set it so that I can&rsquo;t use any apps from my work even if I wanted to. Neither do I get notifications from them. ﻿</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>﻿Samsung has woven a lot of such small additions into the platform. S Pen works nicely. The side Panel stays hidden, yet it is extremely useful. Dex is <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/2023/01/11/android-has-a.html\">an absolute stunner</a>. And the list goes on.</p>\n<p>This post has gone on for much longer than I initially expected. And I haven&rsquo;t even talked about the cameras. With Galaxy S24 Ultra, Samsung has indeed mastered the smartphone.</p>\n",

Barely able to read on my iPad, I picked up my phone and was reminded how I had fallen absolutely in love with this device. Especially the two aspects. The stunning screen. The monstrous battery life.\n\nI don't think I have seen **a better screen** than what this has. All reviews have called it out. But you must experience it to appreciate the brilliance of what Samsung has achieved. The text is crisp; the colours pop out. Plus, the lack of reflection is mindblowing. I don't think I can go back to any other device now that doesn't have the technical wizardry that Samsung has packaged here. It's perfectly visible even in the harshest sunlight without losing clarity or colour.\n\nI am surprised no one built such a screen earlier. This is much more important than the high refresh rate or crazy resolutions. Here's a snapshot from [the official product page](https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s24-ultra/).﻿\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2024/screenshot-2024-02-04-at-1.44.43pm.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"322\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Screen\" style=\"margin: auto;\">\n\n﻿The second one is also a no-brainer with its trade-off -- **the battery life**. Since moving to smartphones in 2009 with the iPhone 3GS, I haven't had any phone with a battery life longer than a day. But then I also stubbornly preferred phones with smaller dimensions. I never liked the likes of Notes and Plueses and Pros and Maxes. So, my decision to shift to a large phone this time was clouded by my fear of discomfort.\n\nAll my fears were washed away right on the second day when my phone wasn't screaming at me to be plugged in. My last phone, the Galaxy S22, was the slickest of all the devices I have ever owned. But it was frustrating to put it to charging every evening. From that to now, when I am easily going through two full days without charging my phone, it is a drastic (and welcome) change. _Even three days once_. This might be a benefit that all large phones share. But with everything this device packs, it has to be the best amongst the best.\n\nEven without the natural benefit of a larger screen to read and write better, I would always select a larger phone from now on just for the battery life it lends.\n\nIn addition, there are miscellaneous benefits of Samsung's versions of Android phones for me. They have been nailing the physical design of the phones for the past few years. Without all the gloss, they look and feel premium in hand. Everyone who has held this device has commended the richness of its feel.\n\nOne UI feels slick, elevating the overall Android experience a notch higher. It's inherently Google but distinctly Samsung at the same time. All the small touches they add across the platform are well thought through. The ones that I have found the most used are [Modes and Routines](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00083201/). It helps set your phone for different phases of the day. I can customize all aspects, the most important being which apps I access during a particular mode. For example, in Life mode, I have set it so that I can't use any apps from my work even if I wanted to. Neither do I get notifications from them. ﻿\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2024/screenshot-20240204-140847-modes-and-routines-1.jpg\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Modes and Routines feature on Galaxy S24 Ultra\" style=\"margin: auto;\">\n\n﻿Samsung has woven a lot of such small additions into the platform. S Pen works nicely. The side Panel stays hidden, yet it is extremely useful. Dex is [an absolute stunner](https://mb.amitgawande.com/2023/01/11/android-has-a.html). And the list goes on.\n\nThis post has gone on for much longer than I initially expected. And I haven't even talked about the cameras. With Galaxy S24 Ultra, Samsung has indeed mastered the smartphone.\n",

				"content_text": "When I upgraded to Galaxy S22 a couple of years back, I wrote this about my initial impressions about the device.\r\n\r\n> I love the design of this phone, plus the feel in the hand. It's compact yet powerful. I also like what Samsung has done with Android. This is possibly the best compact smartphone out there. Not just with Android.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of years with a compact phone, I have decided to jump to the other extreme. I have preordered the Galaxy S24 Ultra. I want to use a monstrous phone now. Though the compact phone was brilliant for general use, two issues have troubled me a lot.\r\n\r\nThe first is battery life. It barely lasted a whole day for me. If I use it heavily, I would need to juice it up towards the evening. With a bigger phone comes a bigger battery. I require a phone that lasts at least a day now.\r\n\r\nThe second is the smaller screen wasn't the best to read and write. Especially later. I felt constrained and generally preferred to read on my iPad and write on my iMac or laptop. I hope both changes with a larger screen.\r\n\r\nI knew back then that Galaxy Ultra was the device I wanted next. I will have one next week.\n",

This post is for the experiments since then.</p>\n<p>Before that, here&rsquo;s a quick note on how I give myself time to arrive at this decision. <em>I have never changed my primary platform</em>. I sign up for an annual plan with a service, set it on a custom sub-domain and use it for a full year. Sure, it&rsquo;s a costly option.

It suited the long-form style of writing I wanted to do more of. It had a built-in newsletter. I wanted all of that. The question was, can it become my primary blogging platform. A year of continuous usage convinced me it wasn&rsquo;t. Though I liked what it offered, it didn&rsquo;t fit my style of writing. I am very informal in what I write. Sometimes, it is heartfelt life stories. Other times, it&rsquo;s meaningless updates. More often, it&rsquo;s the latter. Ghost isn&rsquo;t a right fit for such posts.</p>\n<p>For starters, it continues to need a title. And images. It wants me to play around with the metadata of the post. Before I can publish a post, all the bells and whistles distract me and I start to question if my words are worth all this polish. That&rsquo;s not the feeling I want when I am about to click publish. It limits what I can do with the styling. Even the paid plan has a very limited selection of themes.

I could never write quick, short posts &ndash; it was that good.</p>\n<p>But there are significant downsides that I cannot brush aside. Adding images to posts isn&rsquo;t easy &ndash; need to go to a separate place to do that. The published posts look clean, but soulless. The options for styling are extremely limited. An ability to extend the capabilities is almost non-existent. The selection of good themes is negligible. The biggest problem of all is the publishing workflow, especially writing drafts, which is very frustrating. Drafts are posts published anonymously. But publishing them back to the main blog isn&rsquo;t intuitive. The published dates get all messed up.</p>\n<p>Also, I am not sure if the platform is in active development.

If this is the case, how can I separate things that I love from those I want to believe I love?\n\nAnother reason might be that the things I love aren't easy for me to do. I haven't mastered how to meditate. Or to journal. They don't come naturally to me and hence, even a feeble friction -- late nights or a busy work schedule or an unplanned travel -- derails all my attempts to do any of these regularly. I need self-discipline to force myself to do such activities regularly (and patiently) as only through repetition will I master them. Only then would they start coming naturally to me. \n\nI am yet to be convinced of the real reason. Maybe it is both; maybe neither. Whatever the case, I continue to force a routine on myself for I know of no other path to self-discipline.\n",

Although there are some that I regularly follow, I lack a daily routine of any sort, whether in the mornings, evenings or through the day.</p>\n<p>I know the routines are essential, mainly to free up some mental space for the creative work. It <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-you-do-every-day-matters-the-power-of-routines-178592\">makes sense</a> that &ldquo;regular work processes allows workers to spend less cognitive energy on recurring tasks, which can support focus and creativity for more complex tasks.&rdquo; I then find it surprising that I have a complicated relationship with my routines.</p>\n<p>I wake up, sleep at fixed times, and have a chain of habits associated with the time after and before. But nothing else sticks.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t have a time blocked for focused work. Or for my hobby projects like writing. I then wind down every day feeling frustrated not having achieved what I thought I would at the start of the day.</p>\n<p>While ruminating over these struggles in my journal, I stumbled upon a realization.

				"content_text": "As much as I love my routines, I have recently struggled to keep one. Although there are some that I regularly follow, I lack a daily routine of any sort, whether in the mornings, evenings or through the day. \n\nI know the routines are essential, mainly to free up some mental space for the creative work. It [makes sense](https://theconversation.com/what-you-do-every-day-matters-the-power-of-routines-178592) that \"regular work processes allows workers to spend less cognitive energy on recurring tasks, which can support focus and creativity for more complex tasks.\" I then find it surprising that I have a complicated relationship with my routines.\n\nI wake up, sleep at fixed times, and have a chain of habits associated with the time after and before. But nothing else sticks. \n\nI don't have a time blocked for focused work. Or for my hobby projects like writing. I then wind down every day feeling frustrated not having achieved what I thought I would at the start of the day.\n\nWhile ruminating over these struggles in my journal, I stumbled upon a realization. I cannot follow a daily routine because I lack a work-life balance. But unlike the pre-pandemic period, it is tilted much towards #life. Because I am always working from home, I surround myself with distractions while working.\n\nMy family, my pet and their stories. The apps on my iPad and my books. My home. All pry for my attention.

With Twitter and Facebook dominating soon, all those suggestions became futile.\n\nAs online presence became a popularity contest, a burst of short meaningless quips became the norm. \n\nThrow more at the wall, and something will stick.\n\nI could never play the social media game. It needed the zeal to always stay connected. I instead felt burdened by the pressure of participating non-stop. No surprise, then, that I kept writing on my blog. A lot less frequently, but I did.\n\nWith Twitter and Facebook dropping in popularity, I expect blogging to attract a few new users as an outlet for their voice. And I also expect the pundits to pollute the internet again with their suggestions on the best ways to blog.\n\nLet me spill the beans. There isn't one.\n\nWrite anything. Write anytime. Write anywhere. \n\nDon't worry about followers. Don't worry about likes and reposts. There aren't any. Some see this as a limitation -- [I find it liberating](https://amitg.blog/today-i-began-reading-writing-is-my-drink-by-theo-pauline-nestor).\n\nI need not fight to make my words stand out because only I write on my blog. *Everything I write is always visible*.\n",

But the real takeaway from the tale was to be wary of one's instinctive reactions.\n\nThe spontaneous reactions taken in anger are as instinctive as instinctive can get. In that sense, anger is destructive. Rebounding from the aftermath that an angry reaction leaves behind is no painless task. It doesn't matter how much one attempts to recover what was lost; the scarred mind cannot be easily healed. \n\nBecause anger scars both people, even the one who gets angry. \n\nHence I have moulded myself to not give in to the instinct when angry. I remind myself that my brain is muddled, and the best action I can take is to walk away and take a few deep breaths. It avoids ruining the remaining day for the other person and me.\n\nDon't recover. Resist.\n",

Precisely what and how were determined as I typed along.\n\nThe posts I wrote then sure weren't the best of my works. \n\nYet I want to find that writer within me again. *He was fun*. Next, lend him my experience from writing over these years. He will bring the ideas, and I will bring in the sanity. My anticipation for this space is to be that playground. \n\nI hence append the note I had made. Spontaneity in writing is priceless. *Just be prepared*.\n",

				"content_text": "<p>My laptop has been off battery power for the past couple of weeks. I hardly used it, which made me realize how much I missed it. It felt good to have it back on my lap.</p><p>Sure, I had an iMac and an iPad with me to use. And, of course, I had my phone too. But a laptop has the best form factor for casual writing. There is some comfort in carrying this device to a corner of your home that you find the most convenient at that moment. I don't need to be near power. I don't need a sitting chair. Or a desk. <em>I don't even need a data connection</em>. My laptop is perfect without any of these.</p><p>I had <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/2021/03/20/i-love-my.html\">confessed my love</a> for this device earlier too.</p><blockquote>I love my laptop a lot more than my smartphone and my tablet. I’m more comfortable with the trackpad and the keyboard than a touchscreen. I can focus more with a lot more windows in front of me than say one full-screen app.</blockquote><p>The benefits become even more prominent while writing. The device has the best size and best weight. Not too large or too heavy. Especially the thin ultrabooks – like the one I own. It sits comfortably on my lap, allowing me to stretch now and then. It doesn't wobble (or worse, topple over) as I type. If and when I want, I also place it on a stand on my desk, connect it to a big monitor, keyboard and mouse and get typing. </p><p>Neither a desktop nor a tablet can claim to do all of that.</p><p>Sure, each device has the usage it excels at. I always prefer my iPad to read. Or my iMac to get some work done. But when I write, give me my no-nonsense laptop any day.</p><p><strong>Update: </strong>I love the form factor of a traditional laptop. Not the currently popular 2-in-1s or laptops with touchscreens. What they lose in convenience completely overshadows the advantages they claim to provide. Give me a fixed screen with a good keyboard and a workable trackpad, and that's all I want.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I <a href=\"https://amit.status.lol/63a3008d66c2a\">have been</a> down with a fever and cold for the past few days. What's worse is that my daughter has been sick too. Falling ill together doesn't often happen for us. But it is a tiring experience for all at our home when it does.</p><p>It is times like these when I am reminded that my wife is emotionally the strongest in our family. She has been caring for us as we rest in our separate rooms. She took leave from the office, knowing it wouldn't be easy. I hate to say it, but neither my daughter nor I are easy to handle when we get sick. We get fussy and irritated. We become kids. Well, my daughter already is. It is <strong>I </strong>who<strong> </strong>becomes a kid. </p><p>But I admire how effortlessly my wife handles both of us. <em>She is a superwoman</em>, I tell you.</p><p>Plus, the timing isn't good, either. My daughter has been looking forward to the Christmas celebrations at home and school this year. It is one of the few festivals that she loves celebrating. Bringing a Christmas tree and the unique items to decorate it. We tag along and get her some gifts. Make her wish Merry Christmas to all. She loves it. She was excited this time too. She had started singing her version of \"Christmas is my favourite time of the year\".</p><p>Well, it is Christmas eve, and neither of us has recovered from the cold yet.</p><p>My daughter was already bummed she missed the Friday Christmas celebration at her school. The sadness in her eyes was worse than what the illness gave her. The only way to reduce that was to make it special somehow. What can be more special than some quality family time? </p><p>So for the past two days, all of us have been together in our living room in front of the TV. Surrounded by things we would want. </p><p>Watching movie after movie. Harry Potter. Bolt. Home Alone. Penguins of Madagascar. Some by choice. Some, just because that was playing on cable.</p><p>Of course, taking scheduled rests. Playing games together. Eating all the meals together. Having a blast. <em>Together</em>.</p><p><em>Every cloud had a silver lining</em>, mumbled my wife today. Amidst all the hustle-bustle of our routine life – our offices at home and our daughter's school – our family hadn't spent quality time. Though every form of sickness is unwelcome (and I hope my daughter and I start feeling our best soon), the sense of togetherness and family was welcome this time.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I hate Apple for killing the iPod, as they took down the whole MP3 players industry with it. Sure, the rise and popularity of streaming services have played a hand too. But irrespective, my music listening habits have changed tremendously since. So is the iPod's death a cause or an effect of my dwindling love for MP3s? Like most things post-internet, it is both.</p><p>Steve announced the product with a brilliant marketing tagline of <em>1000 songs in your pocket</em>. Unfortunately <em>or fortunately</em>, it also meant <em>only</em> 1000 songs in your pocket. With my first internship stipend, I purchased an iPod shuffle and fell in love with the device. I carefully selected a few songs I could listen to on a loop. Or day-in-day-out. I built my playlists for the different moods. I subconsciously memorised each of those few songs — the first tune, or the few beats, were enough for me to start crooning along.</p><p>My love for owning music goes way back to the pre-iPod days, though. At first, it was with my Sony walkman and the few cassettes that I built a liking for. Even when the computers came, I created a collection of music that I was incredibly proud of. For my friends, I was the guy to visit when they needed a song, new or old. Or when they needed to find the one song which they could remember only vaguely. We sang those songs for hours. In our rooms, in classrooms, in corridors and on trains. We built a liking for the few songs as we made listening to them a habit, a hobby.</p><p>That is not the case anymore.</p><p>With streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music, I now have all the songs I need in my pocket. And yet the experience has slowly grown hollow. These days, I put on the music more as background static than the immersed escapade that it earlier was. My mood doesn't decide the music I listen to. Some curator on Spotify does so. This thought in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/27/theres-endless-choice-but-youre-not-listening-fans-quitting-spotify-to-save-their-love-of-music\">a recent Guardian article</a> resonated with me.</p><blockquote>Streaming makes the listening experience much more passive. (…) This idea that you can just turn on a faucet, and out comes music. It’s something that leaves everyone to take it for granted.</blockquote><p>Passive consumption is not suitable for any form of art — music is an art of the most extraordinary form. Listening to music was a hobby once. People listened to music as an involved activity -- not a medium, to put them in a focused mood while they do something else. Or to mute the background noise. You don't say, \"I am reading a book\", when you skim through the pages only to fall asleep, do you?</p><p>I am reminded of my changed habits whenever I see my daughter enjoy her music. She has a set of some 50 songs which she listens to every day. She plays the same songs even on streaming services. She selectively adds a song to the list and does so only after she has listened to it enough. Just like the pre-internet me, she embraces her music – the first 2 seconds of a song are enough for her to start singing along aloud. Not just the lyrics but even every tune.</p><p>Sure, I could still fall back to my music-listening style of yesteryears with my smartphone. But the \"smartness\" of the device already hinders any semblance of focus that the one-purpose iPod allowed. I also understand that there are a lot of positives to streaming services. The discovery of new music and artist is one big plus. But what is a discovery worth if I don't feel the emotion behind it?</p>\n",

While other kids struggled to put their legs in sync, these girls walked with ease.</p><p>They had made the new way of walking a natural. Practice is known to do that. I agree with Paulo Coelho when he says, \"To become really good at anything, you have to practice and repeat, practice and repeat until the technique becomes intuitive.\" With practice, you fight the competition by not fighting it but by internalizing the rules. Even in life, you can get bogged down by the many curveballs that life hurls at you or decide to internalize the rules. The choice is individual.</p><p>Longer rallies in racquet sports tend to have a slightly different effect. For instance, my friends and I are incredibly competitive whenever we play a game of badminton. We want to win a point against the folks on the other side of the net as quickly as we can. So our rallies are usually short. But every time a rally lasts long, we subconsciously stop playing <em>against</em> one another - instead, we start to play together against the shuttlecock. So, we invariably want the rally to last even longer.</p><p>Isn't it funny how a situation at a point turns the very rules of the game on its head? How your competitor momentarily changes mid-match when it is competitor no more?</p>\n",

I fell in love with Windows XP even on my PC hardware that didn&rsquo;t support the OS well then.</p>\n<p>However, what I had for this platform wasn&rsquo;t love. For the small town I am from, Windows was the default platform. At home, in school and at work. Mac OS wasn&rsquo;t a name anyone had heard. Linux was limited to textbooks.</p>\n<p>I dabbled with the latter during my bachelor&rsquo;s and the developer in me was instantly captivated. It wasn&rsquo;t ready to replace the default OS on my desktop though. There was still some time to go before it could go mainstream. So like most folks around me, I dual-booted Windows and Linux.</p>\n<p>However, I believe things have improved since then. There are many &ldquo;flavours&rdquo; of Linux today that target users beyond developers. Why not then should I give them a try again?</p>\n<p>So I <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/2022/05/30/i-have-replaced.html\">have been running Linux</a> as my primary OS for more than a few months now. I haven&rsquo;t missed my default platform yet. It may not still be ready for all the people that Microsoft targets with Windows. But it is ready to be the default platform for many tech-minded folks out there.</p>\n<p>I am not going back to Windows anymore. I don&rsquo;t have any incentive,</p>\n<p>PS: I am trying <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/google-chrome-os-flex-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-use-it/ar-AAZrwUy\">Chrome OS Flex</a> currently.

I fell in love with Windows XP even on my PC hardware that didn't support the OS well then.\n\nHowever, what I had for this platform wasn't love. For the small town I am from, Windows was the default platform. At home, in school and at work. Mac OS wasn't a name anyone had heard. Linux was limited to textbooks. \n\nI dabbled with the latter during my bachelor's and the developer in me was instantly captivated. It wasn't ready to replace the default OS on my desktop though. There was still some time to go before it could go mainstream. So like most folks around me, I dual-booted Windows and Linux.\n\nHowever, I believe things have improved since then. There are many \"flavours\" of Linux today that target users beyond developers. Why not then should I give them a try again?\n\nSo I [have been running Linux](https://mb.amitgawande.com/2022/05/30/i-have-replaced.html) as my primary OS for more than a few months now. I haven't missed my default platform yet. It may not still be ready for all the people that Microsoft targets with Windows. But it is ready to be the default platform for many tech-minded folks out there.\n\nI am not going back to Windows anymore. I don't have any incentive,\n\nPS: I am trying [Chrome OS Flex](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/google-chrome-os-flex-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-use-it/ar-AAZrwUy) currently. I am pretty impressed with this flavour of an operating system. It's light and fast. Plus it also runs Linux now. Except for the fear of Google, this platform has a lot going for it.\n",

I found this suggestion really on the mark.\r\n\r\n> Research is a distillation. You’ll spend two hours reading, to get four paragraphs of notes, which provide eight words of story — but those eight words will take the reader into the world you’ve created, and create the impression that your character really is there, or really knows about this topic.

For a body and mind that has gotten used to the sluggish at-home routine, the rush-filled days are exhausting. I haven’t gotten used to this routine yet.</p>\n<p>It isn’t as if I am working more.

The way we work when we can interact face-to-face is very different from when it is all virtual. We take many decisions without planning and booking a time on the calendar; as a result, we close more discussions. The virtual mode of working restrained us through the need to over-plan. Over-schedule. It’s surprising how free I felt when I could simply walk to a person and talk.</p>\n<p>Sure, the away-from-home routine has impacted my reading and writing habits, too. Well, to be frank, those habits are impacted for quite some time now. I need to get back, find a window to think in this hectic, unsteady life. It’s not new to me, but it’s funny how a couple of years at home has made me forget the office lifestyle.

There’s satisfaction on her tired face.\n\nIs it all bad for me? Well, to be frank, not at all. I have enjoyed the company of coworkers in the last week. The way we work when we can interact face-to-face is very different from when it is all virtual. We take many decisions without planning and booking a time on the calendar; as a result, we close more discussions. The virtual mode of working restrained us through the need to over-plan. Over-schedule. It’s surprising how free I felt when I could simply walk to a person and talk.\n\nSure, the away-from-home routine has impacted my reading and writing habits, too. Well, to be frank, those habits are impacted for quite some time now. I need to get back, find a window to think in this hectic, unsteady life. It’s not new to me, but it’s funny how a couple of years at home has made me forget the office lifestyle. What was the work-life balance that we talked so much about, again?\n\nWell, that’s a thought to ponder over some other time.\n\n----\n\nThis post was sent as an introduction for this week’s issue of [my weekly newsletter](https://mb.amitgawande.com/subscribe/). I have realized the updates I begin my newsletter with every week get lost once it is out. So I intend to publish these as individual posts also.\n",

People are already getting sick of being half-assed about things, I like to think.\r\n\r\nSource: [Go Deeper, Not Wider](https://www.raptitude.com/2017/12/go-deeper-not-wider/) →\n",

				"title": "Porting Hugo theme to Micro.blog",
				"content_html": "<p>Micro.blog is a blogging platform built over Hugo, a fast static site engine. Given the way it is structured, every theme created for Hugo can potentially work with the blog hosted by Micro.blog. However, there are a few aspects added to Hugo that are specific to the way things work in Micro.blog. These need to be included as part of the themes to make the most of the features of this platform.</p>\n<p>This article presents a non-extensive list of things that should be evaluated and included while porting a theme that is made for Hugo to Micro.blog. I have written this as I dug into the existing themes <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/2022/01/23/paper-a-clean.html\">while porting Paper theme</a>. As of this writing, a theme is considered as a plug-in in Micro.blog. Hence, many references link back to the way plug-ins work with the platform.</p>\n<p>To reiterate, this is not an extensive list. Based on how a theme, that is being ported, is set up, one may need only a few of these steps or may need a few more than those listed below. However, this should be a good start to get a working version of the theme out for testing. If there are any issues or concerns, please reply to our email addresses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pre-requisites\">Pre-requisites</h2>\n<p>Of course, the article assumes that you have already identified the theme that you want to port. The <a href=\"https://themes.gohugo.io\">Hugo theme Showcase</a> is a good place to check for all the wonderful themes available.</p>\n<p>Though you are not required to have a detailed understanding of Hugo to port a theme, the knowledge on the below aspects should be handy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-themes/59\">Custom Theme support in Micro.blog</a></li>\n<li>A basic understanding of <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/templates/\">Hugo templates</a> and <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/\">directory structure</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started\">Getting Started</h2>\n<p>The first step to get started is to access and clone the repository of the theme to be ported. You can either do this offline on your desktop or directly create a new theme in Micro.blog with mentioning the theme repository URL as Clone URL. You could then select this newly added theme as a custom theme for your <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2019/09/04/microblog-test-blogs.html\">test blog</a>. This allows you to find out what breaks and also validate the additional modifications that you make to the theme.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>For a theme to work, you only need a few folders and files — a typical Micro.blog theme directory structure is provided below for reference.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-html\" data-lang=\"html\">.\n├── theme.toml\n├── config.json\n├── plugin.json\n├── layouts\n└── static\n</code></pre></div><ul>\n<li><code>theme.toml</code> - Contains bare meta information about the theme, like name, description, license, features, author.</li>\n<li><code>config.json</code> - Contains any properties required and referenced by the template files of the theme. If the property is to be provided by the user, typically it should be taken as a setting, defined in a separate file.</li>\n<li><code>plugin.json</code> - Contains meta information about the custom theme to be displayed as part of plugin repository. It also defines the feature settings that can be provided by user while plugin configuration. Refer to <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/plug-ins/104\">official guide on plug-ins</a> for more details about this file.</li>\n<li><code>layouts</code> - A folder that stores <code>html</code> templates that defines how views of different content types will be rendered on a website with the style.</li>\n<li><code>static</code> - A folder that stores all the static content like CSS, JavaScript, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can get rid of all the other unnecessary files and folders and only keep the above-mentioned ones. This will keep the list of files in which changes are to be made manageable.</p>\n<p>Before we move ahead, here’s a list of basic template files in the <code>layouts</code> folders that one would modify typically to port a theme.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>/_default/list.html</code> - A template that renders pages with multiple pieces of content, this includes the homepage. A homepage can also be independently styled by defining a template <code>index.html</code> in the root directory.</li>\n<li><code>/_default/single.html</code> or <code>posts/single.html</code> - A template that renders a page for a single post.</li>\n<li><code>/_default/list.archivehtml.html</code> - A template that renders the archive page of your website.</li>\n<li><code>/partials/head.html</code> - A template that defines the <code>head</code> section of your final rendered HTML.</li>\n<li><code>/partials/header.html</code> - A template that defines the header of your blog. This typically includes the site title, subtitle, navigation menu etc.</li>\n<li><code>/partials/footer.html</code> - A template that defines the footer of your blog. This typically includes the copyrights, author information etc.</li>\n<li><code>/_default/baseof.html</code> - A base template that stitches all the above defined partials together, including the main sections defined in list and single template pages above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A theme might have all the above files, or have just a subset of these. In case a theme does not provide a particular template file, one from the basic theme (which forms the base of every theme) of Micro.blog is used.</p>\n<p>Moreover, make sure you configure the appropriate Hugo Version to be used for your blog. Micro.blog allows two versions of Hugo to be used, 0.54 and 0.91, the latest being relatively new. Many themes may not work with the older 0.54 version of the Hugo, typically indicated by the <code>min_version</code> configuration in the <code>theme.toml</code>. If the value is above 0.54, set the Hugo version to be used as 0.91. This can be done via Design → Hugo Version.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fix-the-broken-pages\">Fix the Broken Pages</h2>\n<p>Usually, the home page might not render the list of all the posts with the ported templates. This is often due to the wrong selection of the posts. To check the selection, visit the list template mentioned above and fix the file which is fetching all the posts. It should typically look like below where you pull all the regular pages where type is defined as post.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-html\" data-lang=\"html\">{{ $pages = where .Site.RegularPages &#34;Type&#34; &#34;post&#34; }}\n</code></pre></div><p>A similar fix would also need to be applied to the archive page’s template, if it is defined custom. The archive page would also need styling the components appropriately, as these are all Micro.blog specific classes, not part of the default styling of the theme.</p>\n<p>Next, you will have to fix the templates to handle the title-less posts. Most posts published with Micro.blog are, well, micro-posts with no titles. So, wherever a Title is referenced, it should be wrapped in a <code>&amp;#123;&amp;#123; if .Title }}</code> condition. So, the title reference at every place should read like below.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-html\" data-lang=\"html\">{{ if .Title }}\n\t&lt;<span style=\"color:#f92672\">h2</span>&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/<span style=\"color:#f92672\">h2</span>&gt;\n{{ end }}\n</code></pre></div><p>The title-less posts might also need minor styling fixes. A typical pitfall is when a post permalink is only available with title. So, a micro-post requires a different element to carry the permalink, mostly the date-time of the post.</p>\n<p>Another aspect that is typically broken is rendering of the taxonomy. Most of the themes in Hugo use tags to define the taxonomy. Micro.blog uses categories and hence need to fetch them differently. So at every place a template mentions tags, mostly on list template, archives template and single template, replace them with categories. This primarily involves replacing all the references of <code>.Params.tags</code> with <code>.Params.categories</code>.</p>\n<p>With these changes handled, you should have a working website that renders correctly. However, it is still not customised to include the benefits that Micro.blog brings to the table.</p>\n<h2 id=\"add-microblog-specific-tags\">Add Micro.blog Specific Tags</h2>\n<p>Micro.blog packs the key IndieWeb principles, like IndieAuth, MicroPub, Webmentions, out-of-box for all websites hosted with the platform. However, this does involve defining a few relevant aspects at appropriate places. In addition, the platform is also rich in the ways a user not adept with coding can customise their website to their liking, with support for providing custom CSS, footer and plug-ins. Enabling these also need relevant components to be defined.</p>\n<p>The changes to be made are in two files. First, modify the partials template that defines the head section of your website, <code>/partials/head.html</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"

These need to be included as part of the themes to make the most of the features of this platform. \n\nThis article presents a non-extensive list of things that should be evaluated and included while porting a theme that is made for Hugo to Micro.blog. I have written this as I dug into the existing themes [while porting Paper theme](https://mb.amitgawande.com/2022/01/23/paper-a-clean.html). As of this writing, a theme is considered as a plug-in in Micro.blog. Hence, many references link back to the way plug-ins work with the platform.\n\nTo reiterate, this is not an extensive list. Based on how a theme, that is being ported, is set up, one may need only a few of these steps or may need a few more than those listed below. However, this should be a good start to get a working version of the theme out for testing. If there are any issues or concerns, please reply to our email addresses.\n\n## Pre-requisites\nOf course, the article assumes that you have already identified the theme that you want to port. The [Hugo theme Showcase](https://themes.gohugo.io) is a good place to check for all the wonderful themes available. \n\nThough you are not required to have a detailed understanding of Hugo to port a theme, the knowledge on the below aspects should be handy.\n\n- [Custom Theme support in Micro.blog](https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-themes/59)\n- A basic understanding of [Hugo templates](https://gohugo.io/templates/) and [directory structure](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe first step to get started is to access and clone the repository of the theme to be ported. You can either do this offline on your desktop or directly create a new theme in Micro.blog with mentioning the theme repository URL as Clone URL. You could then select this newly added theme as a custom theme for your [test blog](https://www.manton.org/2019/09/04/microblog-test-blogs.html). This allows you to find out what breaks and also validate the additional modifications that you make to the theme.\n\n<img src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2022/7fde8afe70.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"188\" alt=\"\" />\n\nFor a theme to work, you only need a few folders and files — a typical Micro.blog theme directory structure is provided below for reference.\n\n```html\n.\n├── theme.toml\n├── config.json\n├── plugin.json\n├── layouts\n└── static\n```\n\n- `theme.toml` - Contains bare meta information about the theme, like name, description, license, features, author. \n- `config.json` - Contains any properties required and referenced by the template files of the theme. If the property is to be provided by the user, typically it should be taken as a setting, defined in a separate file. \n- `plugin.json` - Contains meta information about the custom theme to be displayed as part of plugin repository. It also defines the feature settings that can be provided by user while plugin configuration. Refer to [official guide on plug-ins](https://help.micro.blog/t/plug-ins/104) for more details about this file. \n - `layouts` - A folder that stores `html` templates that defines how views of different content types will be rendered on a website with the style.\n- `static` - A folder that stores all the static content like CSS, JavaScript, etc.\n\nYou can get rid of all the other unnecessary files and folders and only keep the above-mentioned ones. This will keep the list of files in which changes are to be made manageable.\n\nBefore we move ahead, here’s a list of basic template files in the `layouts` folders that one would modify typically to port a theme.\n\n- `/_default/list.html` - A template that renders pages with multiple pieces of content, this includes the homepage. A homepage can also be independently styled by defining a template `index.html` in the root directory.\n- `/_default/single.html` or `posts/single.html` - A template that renders a page for a single post.\n- `/_default/list.archivehtml.html` - A template that renders the archive page of your website.\n- `/partials/head.html` - A template that defines the `head` section of your final rendered HTML.\n- `/partials/header.html` - A template that defines the header of your blog. This typically includes the site title, subtitle, navigation menu etc.\n- `/partials/footer.html` - A template that defines the footer of your blog. This typically includes the copyrights, author information etc.\n- `/_default/baseof.html` - A base template that stitches all the above defined partials together, including the main sections defined in list and single template pages above.\n\nA theme might have all the above files, or have just a subset of these. In case a theme does not provide a particular template file, one from the basic theme (which forms the base of every theme) of Micro.blog is used. \n\nMoreover, make sure you configure the appropriate Hugo Version to be used for your blog. Micro.blog allows two versions of Hugo to be used, 0.54 and 0.91, the latest being relatively new. Many themes may not work with the older 0.54 version of the Hugo, typically indicated by the `min_version` configuration in the `theme.toml`. If the value is above 0.54, set the Hugo version to be used as 0.91. This can be done via Design → Hugo Version.\n\n## Fix the Broken Pages\n\nUsually, the home page might not render the list of all the posts with the ported templates. This is often due to the wrong selection of the posts. To check the selection, visit the list template mentioned above and fix the file which is fetching all the posts. It should typically look like below where you pull all the regular pages where type is defined as post. \n\n```html\n{{ $pages = where .Site.RegularPages \"Type\" \"post\" }}\n```\n\nA similar fix would also need to be applied to the archive page’s template, if it is defined custom. The archive page would also need styling the components appropriately, as these are all Micro.blog specific classes, not part of the default styling of the theme.\n\nNext, you will have to fix the templates to handle the title-less posts. Most posts published with Micro.blog are, well, micro-posts with no titles. So, wherever a Title is referenced, it should be wrapped in a `&#123;&#123; if .Title }}` condition. So, the title reference at every place should read like below.\n\n```html\n{{ if .Title }}\n\t<h2>{{ .Title }}</h2>\n{{ end }}\n```\n\nThe title-less posts might also need minor styling fixes. A typical pitfall is when a post permalink is only available with title. So, a micro-post requires a different element to carry the permalink, mostly the date-time of the post. \n\nAnother aspect that is typically broken is rendering of the taxonomy. Most of the themes in Hugo use tags to define the taxonomy. Micro.blog uses categories and hence need to fetch them differently. So at every place a template mentions tags, mostly on list template, archives template and single template, replace them with categories. This primarily involves replacing all the references of `.Params.tags` with `.Params.categories`.\n\nWith these changes handled, you should have a working website that renders correctly. However, it is still not customised to include the benefits that Micro.blog brings to the table.\n\n## Add Micro.blog Specific Tags\n\nMicro.blog packs the key IndieWeb principles, like IndieAuth, MicroPub, Webmentions, out-of-box for all websites hosted with the platform. However, this does involve defining a few relevant aspects at appropriate places. In addition, the platform is also rich in the ways a user not adept with coding can customise their website to their liking, with support for providing custom CSS, footer and plug-ins. Enabling these also need relevant components to be defined.\n\nThe changes to be made are in two files. First, modify the partials template that defines the head section of your website, `/partials/head.html`.\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ \"custom.css\" | relURL }}?{{ .Site.Params.theme_seconds }}\">\n<link rel=\"me\" href=\"https://micro.blog/{{ .Site.Author.username }}\" />\n{{ with .Site.Params.twitter_username }}\n\t<link rel=\"me\" href=\"https://twitter.com/{{ . }}\" />\n{{ end }}\n{{ with .Site.Params.github_username }}\n\t<link rel=\"me\" href=\"https://github.com/{{ . }}\" />\n{{ end }}\n{{ with .Site.Params.instagram_username }}\n\t<link rel=\"me\" href=\"https://instagram.com/{{ . }}\" />\n{{ end }}\n\n<link rel=\"authorization_endpoint\" href=\"https://micro.blog/indieauth/auth\" />\n<link rel=\"token_endpoint\" href=\"https://micro.blog/indieauth/token\" />\n<link rel=\"micropub\" href=\"https://micro.blog/micropub\" />\n<link rel=\"microsub\" href=\"https://micro.blog/microsub\" />\n<link rel=\"webmention\" href=\"https://micro.blog/webmention\" />\n<link rel=\"subscribe\" href=\"https://micro.blog/users/follow\" />\n\n{{ range .Site.Params.plugins_css }}\n\t<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ . }}\" />\n{{ end }}\n{{ range $filename := .Site.Params.plugins_html }}\n\t{{ partial $filename $ }}\n{{ end }}\n```\n\nNext, add the below lines to the end of your base template, `/_default/baseof.html` just before `</body>`. These load the custom footer and the plug-ins defined JavaScripts.\n\n```html\n{{ partial \"custom_footer.html\" . }}\n\n{{ range .Site.Params.plugins_js }}\n\t<script src=\"{{ . }}\"></script>\n{{ end }}\n```\n\n## Display Replies as Conversations\nMicro.blog allows including replies made on the posts to be shown as conversations on a post page via a design setting (Design → Include conversation on post page). However, for the replies to be rendered on your post page, you need to modify your single template, `/_default/single.html` or `posts/single.html`, and add the below lines at the end.\n\n```html\n{{ if .Site.Params.include_conversation }}\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://micro.blog/conversation.js?url={{ .Permalink }}\"></script>\n{{ end }}\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nThe difficulty involved in porting a Hugo theme to Micro.blog depends completely on the complexity of the original theme. Though it is difficult to extensively cover all the changes required, fixing the things that are broken and adding support for the Micro.blog specific features and tags is all it takes. This article attempted to list down the majority of the identified changes.\n\nIn the future, the way of including the Micro.blog specific changes may be simplified significantly. This article would be updated accordingly to reflect the same. However, the awareness of the changes being done allows one to appreciate the hidden complexity and beauty of the platform that is Micro.blog.\n\n---\n\n**PS**: This post was written for, and [is also published at Custom](https://custom.micro.blog/2022/02/19/porting-hugo-theme.html) by Miraz Jordan - a website that intends to \"develop reference information and tutorials to help people customise themes in hosted Micro.Blogs\". \n\n",

The whole world celebrates along with us as she grows a year old, every year. Or so we have convinced her and her parents. This year is no different, albeit a tad muted. But still, the folks all-around plan to celebrate.</p>\n<p>Knowing how all my plans for 2020 were mercilessly crushed by the pandemic, I had no expectations from 2021. I knew it was going to be more of the same dreadful cycle of panic, despair, and hope. At the same time, I also wished I and all my dear ones sail through, see the end of the year.</p>\n<p>As I sit here today, looking at the year gone by, all I can do is smile. It began with a phase as dark as my family had ever seen. But it brought us all close, gave us the courage to stay strong. We got back on our feet, stronger. We learned to live with the virus, masked whenever outside. Vaccinating ourselves. Slowly, gradually, we wandered, unhesitant, outside our homes.

				"content_text": "![](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2021/resilience.jpg)\n\nSince my niece was born on this day three years ago today, the new year celebrations have been quite unfamiliar for us. The whole world celebrates along with us as she grows a year old, every year. Or so we have convinced her and her parents. This year is no different, albeit a tad muted. But still, the folks all-around plan to celebrate.\n\nKnowing how all my plans for 2020 were mercilessly crushed by the pandemic, I had no expectations from 2021. I knew it was going to be more of the same dreadful cycle of panic, despair, and hope. At the same time, I also wished I and all my dear ones sail through, see the end of the year.\n\nAs I sit here today, looking at the year gone by, all I can do is smile. It began with a phase as dark as my family had ever seen. But it brought us all close, gave us the courage to stay strong. We got back on our feet, stronger. We learned to live with the virus, masked whenever outside. Vaccinating ourselves. Slowly, gradually, we wandered, unhesitant, outside our homes. Each one of us established our own new rules, routines, and traditions around travel. \n\nWe met our friends, got nostalgic for the days that we had left behind. We got hungry, got drunk and laughed our hearts out. I witness my office welcome my colleagues, the floors, and pantries reverberating with grumbles again.\n\nI am fortunate I could do all of that. And a lot more. That I watch my crazy friends share their plans for celebrations with booze and snacks. That I would watch the skies light up with fireworks one more time. I am fortunate that I am about to get ready and join my family to celebrate my niece growing older by another year. \n\nAnd if you are reading this, know that, in one way or the other, you are too. Just look back and find out why. \n\nResilience. And _kismet_. The two words I would remember 2021 by. Wish you a happy new year, you all!\n\n---\n\nArtwork by David Wirzba on Unsplash\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Every time the grinds of the daily life take toll over me, I travel to <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabaleshwar\">a place close by</a> with my family and friends. The last weekend was another such occasion.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I love this place not because it is a perfect family getaway (that it is), but because it is easy to travel to, and so there is not too much planning needed. Most trips get burdensome by the sheer pain of planning so much, so ahead of time. I enjoy the travels where that’s not the case, especially when I have no interest to be a typical tourist and go spot hunting.</p>\n<p>The purpose of one’s visit is what matters at the end. If it is to find out everything of interest in a place, sure, go sign up for a hectic few days. Even I do that at times. But, why do that when irrespective of how much you roam around, you can never cover all the interesting places, anyway? The tourists flocking around an attraction kills it for me. It is just a place of business. I prefer the turn en route where no one halts. Or the point which hasn’t got any fancy name yet.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I know every nook and corner of this resort I stayed in.

				"content_text": "Every time the grinds of the daily life take toll over me, I travel to [a place close by](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabaleshwar) with my family and friends. The last weekend was another such occasion. \n\n<img src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2021/db1204c1ca.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" />\n\nI love this place not because it is a perfect family getaway (that it is), but because it is easy to travel to, and so there is not too much planning needed. Most trips get burdensome by the sheer pain of planning so much, so ahead of time. I enjoy the travels where that’s not the case, especially when I have no interest to be a typical tourist and go spot hunting.\n\nThe purpose of one’s visit is what matters at the end. If it is to find out everything of interest in a place, sure, go sign up for a hectic few days. Even I do that at times. But, why do that when irrespective of how much you roam around, you can never cover all the interesting places, anyway? The tourists flocking around an attraction kills it for me. It is just a place of business. I prefer the turn en route where no one halts. Or the point which hasn’t got any fancy name yet.\n\nAnyway, I know every nook and corner of this resort I stayed in. My family and I have visited every spot of interest in the place, and so can selectively just visit those that _affect us_. We did just that this time, too. Maybe, I am different. I am glad that my family is just like me. Crazy different “tourists” that travel _for_ the experience, not _with_ a checklist!\n\nHere are a couple of more pictures from the relaxing trip.\n\n<img src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2021/4190dd4d3e.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2021/d275e88bcd.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" />\n\n",

				"content_text": "<p>On a scorching Sunday morning, an eight-year-old me is thrilled again to wear my new swimming gear. My parents signed me up for swimming class, which I was habitually against initially. I like water, but I don’t when I have to fight it. Almost a week since the classes started now, I enjoy this time.</p><p>I hear the muffled voices of my trainer, Mr Das, through my swim cap as I try to follow his instructions. He shows a group of children the effect of kicking the water to stay afloat. On the sixth day today, we are still holding on to the edge, flattening our bodies and kicking the heck out of the water.</p><p>“Not so hard, be gentle with those kicks,” I hear Mr Das shout. Most of us kids haven’t learnt how to be gentle with anything. We are having fun with water, splashing it as hard as possible.</p><p>I see my dad sitting outside the pool with the other parents. They are talking, laughing, and being friendly strangers to each other. Bored with all the kicking, I want to swim in the deep pool.</p><p>I am the typical obedient guy who doesn’t do anything he is told not to. But, today, I try. As I release my hold, hands still floating just above the edge, the kicking legs start pulling me backwards. I try to hold on, but my hands slip. I see I am floating away from the safety of something to hold on to. Panicked, I stop kicking and open my mouth to shout for help. I feel the chlorinated water in my nostrils and my throat. \"This is not working. I am going to die,\" I hear myself say. My eyes are watery. I know they are tears, but I am not sure if anyone else does.</p><p>And then suddenly, I feel a hand hold my body from below and carry me closer to the edge. Mr Das has handled many such curious kids over his career. He puts me closer to the edge and shouts, “hold that edge tight and start kicking.”</p><p>I am safe, and I can breathe again. I look towards my dad. Oh, he is oblivious of all that I just went through. I still feel the taste and smell of chlorine. Feeling terrible, I kick harder than usual.</p><p>That is when the smell of chlorine hits me again, and things start to become hazy. I look towards my dad. He and his friends are still prattling. But I see an urgency in the staff around the swimming deck. In the pool, around me, all the kids are loosening their holds off the edges. “Don’t do that,” I try to warn them. I don’t think they hear me. Even I do not hear myself. What is going on? I see myself floating away from the edge, water very close to my mouth and nostrils. I try to hold my breath, but I need to cough. I panic again. Angsty, I move every part of my body. My eyes search for Mr Das, but I don’t see him around.</p><p>My movements slow down suddenly. The commotion around is dying. The voices getting fainter, my vision dreamier. I still feel there is water all around me. I am not feeling right. At this most unfortunate time, everything goes dark. No vision. No sound. An eerie silence. \"<em>I am dead\", </em>I hear myself say.</p><p>But, I hear the faint voices again now. I try to open my eyes, the hazy chaos comes into focus. I am lying on a lawn with strangers running helter-skelter. Other kids are lying around me, motionless. A lady I don’t know is trying to feed me glucose biscuits and milk. I feel it would be better not to put anything down my throat. I am already sick; my dad would know. But I can’t see him. I feel alone, naked. I try to shout for him, but my voice echoes within me. As the chaos around goes faint, I pass out again.</p><p>I wake up another time. We are in an ambulance this time. Now, I do see the face of my dad. He didn’t swim, but his eyes were still watery. He is holding on to my hand tight with those pained yet resolute eyes. I don’t feel naked anymore. Amidst all the turmoil around, I pass out for the third time.</p><p>I open my eyes again; I am feeling light now. I find myself in the waiting area of a hospital. My dad is still around me. Though I am lying comfortably on a bench, he holds my hand very tight. As if he doesn’t want me to get harmed by an impalpable danger. The kid in me doesn’t know it then, but I know now that he blames himself for the event when he feels he almost lost me.</p><p>“I don’t want to go near a swimming pool ever, dad,” I say to him in a weakened voice.</p><p>He looks me in the eye, brushes my hair and responds, “I will never leave you alone, my son. Ever.”</p><p>The two are entirely differing feelings. But I know his promise will govern my life experiences, at least my teenage phase. I never climbed into a swimming pool until I lived with my dad. He never sent me to any place where he could not be with me. For the better part of my youth, both held on to the resolves we took that day.</p><p>Eventually, I did learn to swim the way most of the folks in rural parts of India do. I kept jumping into the water bodies until, one day, I had picked up how not to drown. The water body was the swimming pool, and I learned to stay afloat only as a young adult. But that eventful day of the chlorine leak birthed an overprotective dad, for whom the safety of his child became paramount.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>When I published <a>the first issue of this newsletter</a>, I had no clue I would do that 20 times over the last fifteen months. I had started writing it with a hope that each issue brings some value to a few writers. Sure, the format did change a couple of times. I decided to make it more personal along the way. But I continued to curate links to some of the most wonderful essays I came across. My intension was to inspire the writer within you.</p><p>That's 60 brilliant essays found and shared since that first issue. I have been happy with the journey till now. Greg Anderson reminds me of why that is important.</p><blockquote>Focus on the journey, not the destination. Joy is found not in finishing an activity but in doing it.</blockquote><p>Yes, I have enjoyed writing every issue.  Sometimes it was the letter I was writing to you that I was excited about. Other times, it was the attachment to an essay I was sharing that mattered to me. Whatever the case, I was excited about every issue that I sent to you.</p><p>But that hasn't been the case recently. Sure, I continue to enjoy writing on my blog – as I had said in <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/2021/10/08/why-do-i.html\">one of the recent posts</a>, \"writing something, anything, makes me focused. It calms me down.\" So, it's not the process of writing that I have stopped enjoying. It is the format that, I have realized, I can't give justice to any more.</p><p>\"If you don't want to do it now, you don't want to do it at all. Let it go,\" suggests Derek Sivers in his <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/2021/10/23/i-dont-remember.html\">brilliant</a> new book \"How to Live\".</p><p>So, here I am letting this go. This is the last issue for the newsletter Slanting Nib &amp; A Keyboard. I hope you enjoyed reading the issues as much as I did writing them.</p><p>What does it mean for the subscribers? Well, first off, I will stop sending you any more letters to you, even if you continue to stay signed up. I prefer not to break your trust. You had signed up for something which I no longer intend to deliver.</p><p>With that said, this place <a>Slanting Nib</a> will continue to stay active. As I said earlier, I still <em>love </em>writing. I will post a few stories that are closest to my heart.</p><p>So, if you wish to receive these stories from me via mails, please drop me a note. Just hit reply, or <a>email me.</a> I would be glad to send you my personal stories, with a promise of not doing so more than once a week.</p><p>Thank you for subscribing and <em>reading </em>my newsletter. Goodbye for now!</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I recently <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/2021/10/12/of-course-i.html\">started blogging with Drummer</a>, a new Outliner made public by Dave Winer. It has been a wonderful experience. I don’t know what it is about a single outline as a base for your blog, but it feels natural. I have been enjoying writing and playing around with <a href=\"https://ol.amitgawande.com\">my Drummer blog</a>. However, it is not easy to fathom the simplicity of the whole system just through words — only trying it out will make you appreciate the ease. I wanted to capture what it is and how to quickly get started with it for myself and others to follow.</p>\n<p>Drummer documentation captures most of this information. But for someone, like me, who’s new to the concept of outliner, the whole stuff can be pretty overwhelming. So, here I capture what I learned and liked so that it helps other newbies like me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-an-outliner\">What’s an Outliner?</h2>\n<p>An outliner is basically an editor that can edit an outline. What is an outline, you ask? Well, outline is text items represented in a hierarchy, with each item having a parent (typically a title) or multiple sub-items (typically related points). There’s a lot more to know, but I am more focused on drawing a parallel with regular blogging terminologies.</p>\n<p>You can think of a first parent item as a title of your post. Each sub-item that follows is like a new paragraph. You can further divide the items into sub-items, that’s grouping related points into a subtitle for example. The only difference is instead of it being represented as a header and list of paragraphs, it is a tree-structure of points, closely related and unrelated.</p>\n<p>If a post doesn’t have any child, it’s a titleless post, a micro-post — something like a tweet.</p>\n<p>Dave Winer is the strongest proponent of using the outlines as the base for the blogs, he uses them for his blog, <a href=\"http://scripting.com\">Scripting News</a>. The basic hierarchical structure of an outline, makes using outliner for blogging powerful. Both the types of posts, long-form and micro, sit well together. After all, it’s just one long list of text items one after another. Whether they have a sub-item or not define how they get represented. Or that’s how Dave likes them represented.</p>\n<p>Drummer is one such outliner that benefits from the years of Dave’s experience. He has understood all the nitty-gritty of blogging through this form. So, once you overcome the initial struggle of unknown, the experience is pretty smooth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"is-it-a-blogging-cms\">Is it a Blogging CMS?</h2>\n<p>Not really, Drummer is just a web application that can edit outlines. These outlines are typically represented as an <code>OPML</code> file. Basically, all you do with Drummer is edit <code>OPML</code> files of different forms. It wraps a few special <code>OPML</code> files — mainly <code>blog.opml</code> — to give them specific meaning while using them as base for blogging.</p>\n<p>But, all we do is edit these <code>OPML</code> files then, what builds the blog?</p>\n<p>Well, the software that runs Dave’s blog does that job. It is called <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog\">Old School</a> (because Dave believes this is the old school way of blogging) and is hosted by Dave. In a way, Old School is the blogging CMS and not Drummer.</p>\n<p>So, from my understanding, the way the thing connect is as below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You sign in with your Twitter account and that creates the necessary backend — basically a S3 store for your OPML files — based on your Twitter username.</li>\n<li>You create, view, edit the <code>OPML</code> files using Drummer. The special files like <code>blog.opml</code> and <code>about.opml</code> hold special meaning for Old School. (<strong>Update:</strong> In fact, <code>about.opml</code> is just used for representation. You can name it anything.) So, you update them and through a command in Drummer (Build my blog), you communicate to Old School server to refresh your blog.</li>\n<li>Old School receives the communication and based on provided inputs, it identifies the files to use for building the blog. It reads the <code>OPML</code> files from the backend store for the files and converts them to static files that get served as your blog.</li>\n<li>Old School also serves you blog at the <code>http://oldschool.scripting.com/&lt;your-user-name&gt;</code> URL. So in a way, you don’t need to host any additional software.</li>\n</ol>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-get-started\">How do I get started?</h2>\n<p>Dave has a got a handy documentation in place that you can follow. I will point to the relevant parts in the documentation so that you can follow along and get started.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Main blog:</strong> Follow the <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628692121000\">getting started guide</a> to get a blog up and running with Drummer. In short, create a <code>blog.opml</code> outline file. Make the outline public. And finally, build the blog using <code>Tools &gt; Build my blog...</code>. This should open a new tab with your blog rendered with Old School. You can customise your title and description of your blog and a few head-level attributes.</li>\n<li><strong>Title and Description:</strong> Modify/add the head-level attributes <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> and rebuild your blog.</li>\n<li><strong>Header Image:</strong> Add a head-level attribute <code>urlHeaderImage</code> pointing to the header image of your choice and rebuild your blog.</li>\n<li><strong>Copyright:</strong> Add a head-level attribute <code>copyright</code> with the text you want to appear in the footer and rebuild your blog.</li>\n<li><strong>About Page:</strong> If you want to create a new tab in your blog for <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1633177951000\">your About page</a>, create a new <code>about.opml</code> outline file using Drummer, make the outline public, add a head-level attribute <code>urlAboutOpml</code> pointing to this public outline and build your blog again. (<strong>Update:</strong> In fact, <code>about.opml</code> is just used for representation. You can name it anything, as long as you configure the value for <code>urlAboutOpml</code> accordingly.)</li>\n<li><strong>Link Blog:</strong> If the concept of linkblog excites you, you <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1633177803000\">can use another software</a> by Dave, <a href=\"http://radio3.io/\">Radio3</a>. Just add a new head-level attribute <code>urlLinkblogJson</code> pointing to your linkblog JSON file, which would look something like <code>http://radio3.io/users/&lt;your-user-name&gt;/linkblog.json</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>TimeZone:</strong> To make sure the dates are rendered correctly on your blog, add a head-level attribute <code>timeZoneOffset</code> for the place where you would be blogging from. The value should be the offset from UTC — for example, <code>+5:30</code> for India or <code>-4</code> for New York.</li>\n<li><strong>Creating Post:</strong> Head over to your <code>blog.opml</code> file in Drummer and click on the <strong>+</strong> icon (for New Note), write what you want to write and rebuild your blog. Your post should be up.</li>\n<li><strong>Adding Links:</strong> Select the text to which you want to add a link, click on the “Link” icon (the second icon from top in the icon bar that sits on the left of the editing area) and insert the URL.</li>\n<li><strong>Adding Images:</strong> This one’s slightly tricky. First, have your image hosted on some place where it would be accessible publicly. Get the URL to your image. While on the item you want to associate the image with, click on the “Edit attributes” icon (the third icon from top in the icon bar that sits on the left of the editing area). Now you can either create an inline image (with attribute <code>inlineImage</code>), right-margin image (with attribute <code>image</code>), title image (with attribute <code>metaImage</code>). I wish this work was simpler.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At this point, you should have a well-configured blog up and running. Keep Drummer interface open in tab and keep adding entries. This method of updating your blog will soon grow on you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-else-can-i-customise\">What else can I customise?</h2>\n<p>Even though you have all the basics covered till now, there is still a lot that you can and should do. But I would recommend get comfortable working Drummer and check for yourself if the workflow fits your routine and liking. If it doesn’t, these additional configurations are just a distraction.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you find out that you are enjoying this system of blogging, here are links to a few additional configurations that you can perform.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customise the styling using the custom templates <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628776805000\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://ol.amitgawande.com/2021/10/13/170912.html?title=customTemplateWithDrummer\">2</a></li>\n<li>Build your blog <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628861390000\">with one-click</a> using dedicated icon</li>\n<li>Using Custom Domain for your blog. <a href=\"%20%20https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/#Using%20a%20custom%20domain%20with%20Drummer\">PagePark</a>, <a href=\"https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/#Using%20a%20custom%20domain%20with%20Drummer\">NGINX</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1629212543000\">Create a Glossary</a> — a text replacement/substitution/expansion list</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628781021000\">Embed Tweet</a>. <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628781065000\">Embed YouTube video</a>. <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628781273000\">Emoji Short Codes</a>.</li>\n<li>Enabling <a href=\"http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2021/10/15/203642.html?title=https\">HTTPS for Drummer Blog</a> (evolving)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"a-few-additional-notes\">A Few Additional Notes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>There’s a Mac app (electron based) called <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml\">Electric Drummer</a> that can act as an outliner. However, you should avoid using it for blogging if you intend to blog from multiple systems. Changes made through the app can overwrite ones as done on the web Drummer. So thread carefully.</li>\n<li>Drummer is evolving. Dave is working hard to make sure all serious reported issues are resolved. Early adopters are trying out a hundred things independently.

Drummer is your editor where you write your posts. Old School acts as a CMS to build and serve your blog.</p>\n\n## How do I get started?\nDave has a got a handy documentation in place that you can follow. I will point to the relevant parts in the documentation so that you can follow along and get started.\n\n1. **Main blog:** Follow the [getting started guide](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628692121000) to get a blog up and running with Drummer. In short, create a `blog.opml` outline file. Make the outline public. And finally, build the blog using `Tools > Build my blog...`. This should open a new tab with your blog rendered with Old School. You can customise your title and description of your blog and a few head-level attributes.\n2. **Title and Description:** Modify/add the head-level attributes `title` and `description` and rebuild your blog.\n3. **Header Image:** Add a head-level attribute `urlHeaderImage` pointing to the header image of your choice and rebuild your blog.\n4. **Copyright:** Add a head-level attribute `copyright` with the text you want to appear in the footer and rebuild your blog. \n5. **About Page:** If you want to create a new tab in your blog for [your About page](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1633177951000), create a new `about.opml` outline file using Drummer, make the outline public, add a head-level attribute `urlAboutOpml` pointing to this public outline and build your blog again. (**Update:** In fact, `about.opml` is just used for representation. You can name it anything, as long as you configure the value for `urlAboutOpml` accordingly.)\n6. **Link Blog:** If the concept of linkblog excites you, you [can use another software](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1633177803000) by Dave, [Radio3](http://radio3.io/). Just add a new head-level attribute `urlLinkblogJson` pointing to your linkblog JSON file, which would look something like `http://radio3.io/users/<your-user-name>/linkblog.json`. \n7. **TimeZone:** To make sure the dates are rendered correctly on your blog, add a head-level attribute `timeZoneOffset` for the place where you would be blogging from. The value should be the offset from UTC — for example, `+5:30` for India or `-4` for New York.\n8. **Creating Post:** Head over to your `blog.opml` file in Drummer and click on the **+** icon (for New Note), write what you want to write and rebuild your blog. Your post should be up.\n9. **Adding Links:** Select the text to which you want to add a link, click on the “Link” icon (the second icon from top in the icon bar that sits on the left of the editing area) and insert the URL.\n10. **Adding Images:** This one’s slightly tricky. First, have your image hosted on some place where it would be accessible publicly. Get the URL to your image. While on the item you want to associate the image with, click on the “Edit attributes” icon (the third icon from top in the icon bar that sits on the left of the editing area). Now you can either create an inline image (with attribute `inlineImage`), right-margin image (with attribute `image`), title image (with attribute `metaImage`). I wish this work was simpler.\n\nAt this point, you should have a well-configured blog up and running. Keep Drummer interface open in tab and keep adding entries. This method of updating your blog will soon grow on you.\n\n## What else can I customise?\nEven though you have all the basics covered till now, there is still a lot that you can and should do. But I would recommend get comfortable working Drummer and check for yourself if the workflow fits your routine and liking. If it doesn’t, these additional configurations are just a distraction.\n\nAnyway, if you find out that you are enjoying this system of blogging, here are links to a few additional configurations that you can perform.\n\n- Customise the styling using the custom templates [1](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628776805000), [2](http://ol.amitgawande.com/2021/10/13/170912.html?title=customTemplateWithDrummer)\n- Build your blog [with one-click](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628861390000) using dedicated icon\n- Using Custom Domain for your blog. [PagePark](%20%20https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/#Using%20a%20custom%20domain%20with%20Drummer), [NGINX](https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/#Using%20a%20custom%20domain%20with%20Drummer)\n- [Create a Glossary](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1629212543000) — a text replacement/substitution/expansion list\n- [Embed Tweet](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628781021000). [Embed YouTube video](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628781065000). [Emoji Short Codes](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628781273000).\n- Enabling [HTTPS for Drummer Blog](http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2021/10/15/203642.html?title=https) (evolving)\n\n## A Few Additional Notes\n1. There’s a Mac app (electron based) called [Electric Drummer](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml) that can act as an outliner. However, you should avoid using it for blogging if you intend to blog from multiple systems. Changes made through the app can overwrite ones as done on the web Drummer. So thread carefully.\n2. Drummer is evolving. Dave is working hard to make sure all serious reported issues are resolved. Early adopters are trying out a hundred things independently. If that sounds fun, the [Drummer support issues page](https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues) is the place to go. \n3. You can stay-to-date with all things Drummer by following [this official blog](http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/). \n4. How does Drummer cost zero? [Dave answers](http://scripting.com/2021/10/12.html#a114128).\n5. Why is Drummer, and other software from Dave, so tightly coupled with Twitter? [Dave answers](http://scripting.com/2021/10/13/140500.html?title=whyWeUseTwitterIdentity).\n\n—\n\nI intend to use Drummer as a place where I form my thoughts over the time. The ease of the updating process makes posting unformed thoughts a breeze. So, in a way, this space represents the most raw me. You can follow this me as he experiments with [my Drummer blog](https://ol.amitgawande.com). And of course, there’s an [RSS feed](http://ol.amitgawande.com/rss.xml).\n\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Hello Friend,</p><p>After reading my fair share of self-help books recently, I have realized that they all follow a pattern. They start with a brilliant, unique idea. The first few chapters present the core in the most masterly manner and back it up with intriguing research and anecdotes. The author wants to answer one key question, why all readers <em>should</em> listen to what she says.</p><p>This part of the self-help books, especially those around psychology, gets a firm grasp on my interest. I usually note what amuses me about the central premise and the structure that the writer has put forth thoroughly. And then the book hits a damper.</p><p>Though the initial chapters always pique my interest, the subsequent chapters are most tiring to read through. They are generally fillers, present just to elevate the central idea into a book.</p><p>This hack of chasing fillers taints most of the self-help books published today. To avoid that, the author needs to be an absolute master at what she is talking about. She needs to know a lot more than she is willing to include in the book, a rarity among authors of self-help books. They generally start as a blog post, evolve and expand after numerous interactions with friends and readers.</p><p>Another case when an author doesn’t chase the fillers is when she doesn't hesitate to give up on the conventional measures of completion and success. The author does not consider the number of pages or the quote-worthy phrases as her target – a case in point, most self-published authors.</p><p>The first is about confidence in one's prowess. The second one is about control on one's objective. Self-confidence and self-control allow a writer to eliminate the need to artificially puff up their work with unnecessary fillers. And this has an apt parallel in our real life too. If we have control over deciding what matters, discipline to pursue it and confidence to execute it, we need not surround our lives with fillers.</p><p>Avoid fillers in what you say or do. Be clear about your core and focus only on that. What do you believe in? Everything else that you undertake or achieve is just a filler — all it does is deviate you from what you should focus your time and energy on. What do you believe in? Everything else wastes the time of yours and others, just like a book full of fillers does for its writers and its readers.</p><p>The filler pages do not define a book, the same way the filler days do not define who we are. Our core defines us. So, ask yourself again — what is your core?</p><hr><h3 id=\"the-radical-moral-implications-of-luck-in-human-life-by-david-roberts-%E2%86%92\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/8/21/17687402/kylie-jenner-luck-human-life-moral-privilege\">\"<strong>The Radical </strong>Moral <strong>Implications of Luck in </strong>Human <strong>Life</strong>\"<strong> by David Roberts</strong></a> →</strong></h3><blockquote>Allowing for luck can dent our self-conception. It can diminish our sense of control. It opens up all kinds of uncomfortable questions about obligations to other, less fortunate people. Nonetheless, this is a battle that cannot be bypassed. There can be no ceasefire. Individually, coming to terms with luck is the secular equivalent of religious awakening, the first step in building any coherent universalist moral perspective. Socially, acknowledging the role of luck lays a moral foundation for humane economic, housing, and carceral policy.</blockquote><h3 id=\"why-modern-life-feels-rather-undead-by-chuck-klosterman-%E2%86%92\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/arts/television/05zombies.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all\">\"<strong>Why Modern Life Feels Rather Undead</strong>\"<strong> by Chuck Klosterman</strong></a> </strong>→</h3><blockquote>Every zombie war is a war of attrition. It’s always a numbers game. And it’s more repetitive than complex. In other words, zombie killing is philosophically similar to reading and deleting 400 work e-mails on a Monday morning or filling out paperwork that only generates more paperwork, or following Twitter gossip out of obligation, or performing tedious tasks in which the only true risk is being consumed by the avalanche. The principal downside to any zombie attack is that the zombies will never stop coming; the principal downside to life is that you will be never be finished with whatever it is you do.</blockquote><h3 id=\"the-creative-apocalypse-that-wasn%E2%80%99t-by-steven-johnson-%E2%86%92\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/magazine/the-creative-apocalypse-that-wasnt.html\">\" The Creative Apocalypse That Wasn’t\" by Steven Johnson</a> </strong>→</h3><blockquote>It has never been easier to <em><em>start</em></em> making money from creative work, for your passion to undertake that critical leap from pure hobby to part-time income source. Write a novel or record an album, and you can get it online and available for purchase right away, without persuading an editor or an A&amp;R executive that your work is commercially viable. From the consumer’s perspective, blurring the boundaries has an obvious benefit: It widens the pool of potential talent. But it also has an important social merit. Widening the pool means that more people are earning income by doing what they love.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>I also write long-form essays by choice, which I publish along with the issues of this newsletter.

				"content_text": "<p>Over the years, I have realized that my mind is a pool of copious ideas from varied fields. It is like an open pond, extremely prone to ripples from externalities, big and small. There was a time when I picked every idea up and started working on it. I would spend weeks on these side projects. Soon, there would be a new one vying for my attention and I would hop onto the new hustle.</p><p>I have begun and shuttered so many of such side projects that I have lost count of them now. Some new platforms that solved no new problem for me. An open-source utility which I understood nothing of, except for the fact that its source was open. A self-hosted service that I had no use for. And the list goes on and on. </p><p>My fascination towards such unending projects affected me in many ways. The most troubling of them was that I had no time to pause and listen to my thoughts. I lent myself no time to <em>not</em> be busy, to slack. Here's Shane Parrish <a href=\"https://fs.blog/2021/05/slack/\">reiterating the importance of slack</a> to be productive in our lives (as defined by Tom DeMarco in his book <em><em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123715.Slack\">Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency</a></em></em>). </p><blockquote>Many of us have come to expect work to involve no slack time because of the negative way we perceive it. In a world of manic efficiency, slack often comes across as laziness or a lack of initiative. Without slack time, however, we know we won’t be able to get through new tasks straight away, and if someone insists we should, we have to drop whatever we were previously doing.</blockquote><p>That is precisely the state I found myself in. I was too welcoming, with my arms spread, ready to embrace anything and everything that got recommended to me. Even a mention of such a topic, and I was all ears.</p><p>I no longer do that. Anytime I am faced with such a ripple now, I take a deep breath, blink and calmly say, \"no, I do not have time for you. You, even though curious, are not my priority.\"</p><p>Priority is an important word that governs how we lead our life. I recently learnt that when the term \"priority\" was coined (somewhere in the 1300s), it was singular. It stayed that way for ages. Decades. Centuries. It was only in the 20th century that we, new age humans, muddled the meaning of the term.</p><p>By definition, \"priority\" means \"the quality of being prior\". <em>The prior one</em>. Basically, the stuff of priority is one thing that should get all your attention. </p><p>Then we changed the meaning of <em>being efficient</em>. Doing things as a group, per the plan, within time mattered no more. Each individual had to be manifolds more productive, pick up more things to do in parallel. And in our quest to do more in parallel at all costs, we introduced the plural form of the term \"priority\". We started thinking about those 2 or 4 or 10 things that we could divide our attention among. We assigned numbers to them. \"<em>This is priority 1. This is a P2 item.\" </em></p><p>Think about it - the usage of the words \"topmost priority\" itself is so redundant. If you call something a priority, it should get your special attention. It should be the thing of <em>the highest importance</em>.</p><p>I have realized the hard way that more often than not, doing less is doing more. When I am not doing many things at the same time, my attention is not spread too thin. Being busy and being productive are two different things. <a href=\"https://perell.com/note/open-mode-and-closed-mode/\">David Perell puts it nicely</a>, contrasting these two distinctive states of mind.</p><blockquote>Our best ideas rarely come alive in busyness. They spring to life in calm and aimless contemplation. In beer mode, you find inspiration. And in coffee mode, you harvest that inspiration.</blockquote><p>The choice of words \"calms and aimless contemplation\" is so brilliant. That's what saying \"no\" to most instinctive side hustles, not always staying busy, allows me time for. I calmly sit idle for hours at times, contemplating on stuff that I read, hear and see. I take notes, jot down thoughts to elaborate on later.</p><p>Here's Parrish again, reminding us of the drawbacks of being constantly busy.</p><blockquote>Being comfortable with sometimes being 0 percent busy means we think about whether we’re doing the right thing. This is in contrast to grabbing the first task we see so no one thinks we’re lazy. The expectation of “constant busyness means efficiency” creates pressure to always look occupied and keep a buffer of work on hand.</blockquote><p>Amen. Could I, then, do more if I didn't hold myself back and said \"yes\" to more things? Maybe. But then, more is not always better.</p><hr><p>Cover Artwork by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@kencheungphoto?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Ken Cheung</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></p>\n",

We are so close, yet so far. Here’s what I want. \n\n1. A service for messaging folks, share text and images\n2. A service for voice/video calls\n3. A service that does both 1 and 2 with apps across platforms - mainly iOS, Android and Web\n\nThis will allow me to not worry about device on which I am using it.\n\niMessage and FaceTime combination is brilliant, but Apple continues to see them as differentiators for its ecosystem. I don’t blame them — but it hurts me. I interact with only a handful of people that own an Apple device.\n\nGoogle, well, decides to live in a fantasy world where there can exist no perfect messaging app. They get close to finding that right solution and throw it all away.\n\nI had hopes from Microsoft. But for some reason they seem not to be interested in consumer space. Skype is ugly, its too bloated and the experience is terrible. It is not easy for families to join from.\n\nWhatsApp, amidst all the mess, remains the only solution that does the required to any extend. It’s a terrible experience, but at least it works. \n\n",

				"title": "On Making Space for More",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Hello Friend,</p><p>Over the last weekend, my wife and I decided to clean all the closets and drawers. Pretty soon, we extended the sphere to cover every nook and corner of our house. The idea was to go through each section of our home, find all the junk lying around unused, and get rid of it if it does not justify the space it occupies. In a way, I was working under the guidance of my wife - <em>the most</em> organized person in my eye. She is very particular about organizing stuff, and here is the process we had followed.</p><p>We selected a closet, took down all the contents, and then worked on them. We segregated them on multiple parameters – when was this last used, is that usage still applicable, is this here just for emotional value and so on. Then, we tagged and ordered them. Finally, we grouped them into containers whose sizes varied from small boxes to huge travel sacks.</p><p>As the sun was on its descent in the sky, we worked on an under-bed drawer. It was a massive unit - enough for a person to sleep comfortably, albeit breathlessly - but it had no compartments. So, naturally, the stuff was just spewed all around, making the whole drawer appear super untidy. Not that any of the items in there were soiled. Many were even untouched, unused. What the drawer was lacking was an arrangement of some kind. So, we got down to work. We grouped and stored the stuff into the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JP5Z88N/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_dl_8SQ0750T8GGEDAJCBDTA\">large storage bag-cum-organizers</a> that we had recently ordered just for this purpose. The difference that simple activity caused was immense. The drawer still contained the same things, but it didn't resemble the mess earlier.</p><p>As the night dawned, we breathed a satisfying sigh, proud of what we had achieved. The cabinets looked clean, and we made space in the whole home. I felt even the home must have breathed a huge sigh of relief - after all, we had relieved it of some burden.</p><p>The slight effort that we had put in to evaluate, dump, segregate and reorganize stuff in our home had made our abode look cleaner, spacious. </p><p>And you know what I realized? I do apply the same process we used to organize our home to my mind too. A slight effort I put in occasionally to evaluate, dump, segregate and reorganize my thoughts leads to a calmer and receptive mind. I dump the thoughts onto the pages of my diary, not trying to organize them in the process. I meditate as I evaluate the thoughts hovering around. Sure, sorting and reorganizing thoughts is not as easy as moving stuff to the storage bags. But to me, a form of bullet journaling helps organize the ideas.</p><p>This process of journaling and meditation is an act of housecleaning for my mind. It declutters it, makes it a lot less messy when I look inwards. At the same time, it frees it up to welcome more ideas. Just as it did recently to our home.</p><p>Anyway, here is the selection of three brilliant essays on life for this week.</p><hr><h3 id=\"we-are-all-confident-idiots-by-david-dunning-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://www.psmag.com/navigation/health-and-behavior/confident-idiots-92793/\">\"We Are All Confident Idiots\" by David Dunning</a> →</h3><blockquote>Because it’s so easy to judge the idiocy of others, it may be sorely tempting to think this doesn’t apply to you. But the problem of unrecognized ignorance is one that visits us all. And over the years, I’ve become convinced of one key, overarching fact about the ignorant mind. One should not think of it as uninformed. Rather, one should think of it as misinformed.<br><br>An ignorant mind is precisely not a spotless, empty vessel, but one that’s filled with the clutter of irrelevant or misleading life experiences, theories, facts, intuitions, strategies, algorithms, heuristics, metaphors, and hunches that regrettably have the look and feel of useful and accurate knowledge.</blockquote><h3 id=\"my-failed-attempts-to-hoard-anything-at-all-by-david-sedaris-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/my-failed-attempts-to-hoard-anything-at-all\">\"My Failed Attempts to Hoard Anything at All\" by David Sedaris</a> →</h3><blockquote>It helps to look at which shelves are bare. That teaches you, I suppose, what you should be hoarding. Most of the people I see in lines these days aren’t real cooks. I noticed at my neighborhood stores that all the canned spaghetti sauces were gone, the horrible ones that taste like ketchup, as well as the frozen pizzas and burritos—stuff we never eat. Toilet paper is gone, too, of course, as are paper towels.</blockquote><h3 id=\"english-is-not-normal-by-john-mcwhorter-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-english-so-weirdly-different-from-other-languages\">\"English Is Not Normal\" by John McWhorter</a> →</h3><blockquote>To be fair, mongrel vocabularies are hardly uncommon worldwide, but English’s hybridity is high on the scale compared with most European languages. The previous sentence, for example, is a riot of words from Old English, Old Norse, French and Latin. Greek is another element: in an alternate universe, we would call photographs ‘lightwriting’. According to a fashion that reached its zenith in the 19th century, scientific things had to be given Greek names. Hence our undecipherable words for chemicals: why can’t we call monosodium glutamate ‘one-salt gluten acid’? It’s too late to ask. But this muttly vocabulary is one of the things that puts such a distance between English and its nearest linguistic neighbours.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>I have recently started writing more long-form essays by choice, which I publish along with the issues of this newsletter.

				"content_text": "<p>I started writing actively on the web some 15 years back. As I look back today to these years gone by, I realize I have discovered a few ironies of life, a few lessons for the writer within me. Today, I want to evaluate where I am and share what I have learned over these years. But let me start with a fascinating Aesop’s fable, though — a tale about a man, his son and their hard-working donkey.</p><p>A man and his son were once walking to the market with their donkey along by their side. Neither of them was sitting on the donkey. A fellow countryman suggested, “Why don't you ride on the donkey? After all, what is it for but to ride upon, you fool?”</p><p>When the man put only the boy on the donkey, another person complained, “Look at that lazy youngster who lets his father walk. Yet, he rides.” Tired, when he got on himself, a woman scoffed, “Shame on that lazy person. He lets his poor little son plod along. Yet, he rides.”</p><p>Well, the man took his boy up before him on the donkey, and the passers-by started jeering and pointing at them. “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey of yours,” they said.</p><p>The man and boy, at last, lifted the donkey over their heads and carried him on their shoulders. They went along as all who they met laughed at them. The donkey, though, knew just one way to live — to do his thing. So, he was still flapping his legs in the air.</p><p>In short, everyone had laughed at the man and the son, whatever they did. It's an interesting tale of how criticism, if paid any heed to, would just make things worse for you. However, here's how I look at the story. </p><p>Do you know who was unaffected as the town was laughing along? Yep, the donkey. Do you know who didn't get any criticism from anyone? Yep, the donkey.</p><p>As I began writing more on the web and making it public, I realized very early on that I cannot let the criticism or the scoff that I will invariably receive from the ugly Internet affect me. I wrote on my blog. I wrote on Medium. Not only that, I shared my writings at many places, not being worried about what others will say. That was so unlike me, the introvert. But if I hadn't done so, I may have stopped writing a long time back.</p><p><em>Try to please everyone, and you will please no one,</em> the saying goes. So, be a donkey, stay unaffected by the criticism and continue your creative work.</p><hr><p>Through these 15 years, my productivity for writing has not been consistent, though. I have been super productive at times, publishing multiple posts in a week, and then there have been times when I did not post for months. I have blamed it on platforms, the editors, my lifestyle, my likings etc. But I have come to realize it is cyclic for me, these are all phases. I do want to compare two specific phases that I have enjoyed a lot. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586875103900-8291ee09d6fd?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHBoYXNlcyUyMG9mJTIwbGlmZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjkyOTMyMDc&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"5184\" height=\"3888\" srcset=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586875103900-8291ee09d6fd?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHBoYXNlcyUyMG9mJTIwbGlmZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjkyOTMyMDc&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586875103900-8291ee09d6fd?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHBoYXNlcyUyMG9mJTIwbGlmZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjkyOTMyMDc&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586875103900-8291ee09d6fd?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHBoYXNlcyUyMG9mJTIwbGlmZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjkyOTMyMDc&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586875103900-8291ee09d6fd?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHBoYXNlcyUyMG9mJTIwbGlmZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjkyOTMyMDc&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@molnj?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Jocelyn Morales</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>There was a time when was I was <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/categories/fiction/\">writing fiction</a> pretty regularly.

I have realized it's the worst way to get inspired to write. I read. I listen. I see. And that's when I write. I can't depend on others for inspiration. I need to seek it out. </p><p>Things tend to happen to you in life when you are not ready. So, I am always ready. I am always writing. What's written is not perfect every time. But when that one perfect thought does hit me, I am usually ready. And boy, I have written my fair share of imperfect posts. Stupid posts. When I read a few of these posts from the early days, I cringe. </p><p>I was told the tone of my posts is not right. Or the platform I am writing at is not right. Or my method of sharing is not right. But I didn't care. I was stubborn in what I wanted to write. It was OK if it came out stupid.</p><p>But you know what, at times I wish I could still be that same free self. The stupid one. I had the most fun then. I am a shadow of that person — but I have learned the lesson. It's OK to be stupid. Just be alive. I write what my mind wants me to write <em>now</em>. At this moment. I write what I want to read. It doesn't matter how cringe-worthy it sounds.</p><p>Be stupid. But then be playful. Be eager to learn.<br>Be stubborn. But then be cautious. Be friendly.</p><p>Do you know what other animal shares all these characteristics as per Wikipedia? A donkey. So be a donkey. But act. Write.

It was OK if it came out stupid.</p><p>But you know what, at times I wish I could still be that same free self. The stupid one. I had the most fun then. I am a shadow of that person — but I have learned the lesson. It's OK to be stupid. Just be alive. I write what my mind wants me to write <em>now</em>. At this moment. I write what I want to read.

				"title": "Realistic Expectations and Notion of Control",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>As I was planning my recent move across the state, I was, deep within, also thinking about what I can expect from this. What would be the benefits of moving away from the current place? What could I do that I am not currently doing? How would my mornings be? Or my evenings? How would my work-life balance change?</p><p>However, I spent no time first acknowledging the state that the things I do not own or control would be in. In short, I was setting too many expectations for myself, signing up for the resultant heartbreak that would invariably cause. Why do I do that? Is it not easy to plan only for things that depend just on me? The things that I do control?</p><p>Resonating with the thoughts I was living through, Jason Becker had <a href=\"https://json.blog/2021/08/07/how-often-am.html\">recently posted</a> how it is frustrating that he could never meet the expectations he sets for himself.</p><blockquote>How often am I angry, frustrated, and disappointed because my expectations could never be met, even if what happens is great? The expectations gap has an outsized impact on my experience. How do I get better at discovering realistic expectations without shortchanging myself?</blockquote><p>Even I got curious. What are realistic expectations? Cheri Baker <a href=\"https://micro.blog/Cheri/11788277\">pointed him</a> to <a href=\"https://modernstoicism.com/what-many-people-misunderstand-about-the-stoic-dichotomy-of-control-by-michael-tremblay/\">an article by Gregory Sadler</a> discussing the Stoic concept of the dichotomy of control. </p><p>It is an insightful read — what was most enlightening for me was reading about the concepts of control and power. Here is the relevant passage from Epictetus's Handbook (emphasis mine) that Gregory examines and talks about.</p><blockquote>Some things are within our power (<em>eph’ ēmin</em> in the original Greek) while others are not. Within our power are opinion, motivation, desire, aversion, and, in a word, <strong>whatever is of our own doing</strong>; not within our power are our body, our property, reputation, office, and, in a word, whatever is not of our own doing.</blockquote><p>I always knew that I should not let things outside my control affect me and my day-to-day life. And I always struggled with that — how can you stay aloof to what is happening around you? Why can't you control your behaviour? I realized after reading the essay, though, that there is a minor distinction between control and power.</p><p>Control is too strong a word. There are times when I (and possibly each one of us) get frustrated and quip that I control nothing. In short, I am neither able to decide nor influence the things happening around me.</p><p>It typically happens when I decide to wake up one fine day, get ready and spend the whole day with myself, reading and writing. But the morning jerks me up amidst complete chaos — things are broken around me, physically and mentally. The tap has suddenly started leaking. Or my kid or spouse do not share my enthusiasm for a beautiful day. Sure, I might still have a wonderful day. But stay saddened by the fact that the day turned out to be so different from what I had fancied.</p><p>So, what does one do? To think that nothing is in our control and not set any expectations is effortless, yet wrong. Furthermore, setting realistic expectations is a lot harder than it sounds. Whatever expectations you set for yourself, there is a slight probability that fate has other plans for you. </p><p>Gregory suggests that I should mould my thought process. Rather than thinking that I would not let things outside my control affect me, I should reason with myself on these lines.</p><blockquote>I am responsible for, and should focus upon, the things that depend upon me, i.e. my beliefs, my decisions, and my character. These are the things that matter, which determine if I am a good or bad person, and If I live a happy or unhappy life. I not mistakenly think my happiness or value is determined by the things not ‘up to’ me.</blockquote><p>Here is my takeaway. The only thing I should focus on is the thing that is up to me, my character. Don't give too much attention to the notion of control. It is not fruitful. Set the expectations, the plan. But be aware that things will not always work out as per the set plan. It is only natural to hold the feeling of frustrations and disappointment as a result. But then realize that these feelings are only temporary, find ways to stay calm amidst disappointment. And definitely, a way to not do that is finding the right expectations to set — there's no <em>right</em> way to do that. </p><p>I have found my ways to stay calm amidst the disappointments. I listen to my favourite music, I write in my diary, I meditate. At times, I simply get back to the work I love. All these acts calm me down. What are the actions that do the same for you?</p>\n",

				"title": "Back to the Home",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Hello Friend, </p><p>I have recently moved back to my permanent address — the place I have been calling home for the past ten years. It was precisely <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/2020/08/19/233840.html\">a year ago</a> that I had shifted to my <em>original </em>hometown. My wife and I wanted to be closer to our parents in these uncertain times. Good that we did. We ploughed through some of the toughest times with the support of the extended family. The sheer burden of the unknown and uncertainty would have crushed the lonely and separated souls.</p><p>Even though the closeness to the family was welcoming, the place you call your home always lends innate warmth. You feel calm, <em>at home</em>, free of some strange burden. Possibly, it is because of the familiarity of the surroundings. Or maybe it is because you have fallen in love with your abode over the many years of togetherness. Whatever the reason, things generally <em>feel </em>right.</p><p>That has been the experience for me for the past week. The period when I was away from this place appears way back in history. Is it not spectacular that you can so easily get habituated to the change in your surroundings?</p><p>That said, the drive back was full of anxiety. The ride, itself, was  uneventful — instead, we welcomed the chance to spend a pleasant 12 hours on the road. It was the inside that was churning with thoughts. I was petrified, thinking about the state the home would be in. Would it be covered knee-deep in the dust? Or full of cobwebs? With pests running everywhere? The fear of the unknown was nibbling my heart within. Just the thought of the sheer work we <em>may</em> have to put in to make the place liveable made me uncomfortable.</p><p>As I unlocked the main door and stepped inside, I realized I was foolish to let these thoughts burden my mind. Of course. Our home is not somewhere in the wild, open for unruly animals to pry at. It is part of a gated community. No cockroaches or spiders were running around the house. The dust that I was so terrified of was barely visible. I could feel it was there. But cleaning that was far from the back-bending chore that I imagined it to be. The home was just the way we had left it, our own. Calm.</p><p>Anyway, the place is back to being our home again. Now, this is also a time to settle into a new routine. A change of setting calls for a change in the way I was leading my life for the past year. I have already got my mornings back — a familiar, peaceful morning is when I am writing this letter in. Now, it is time to handle the other phases of the day.</p><p>With that update out of the way, here is the selection of three brilliant essays on life for this week.</p><hr><h3 id=\"%E2%80%9Cthe-capital-t-truth%E2%80%9D-by-david-foster-wallace-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20080213082423/http://www.marginalia.org/dfw_kenyon_commencement.html\">“The Capital T Truth” by David Foster Wallace</a> →</h3><blockquote>[I]t is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead of getting hypnotized by the constant monologue inside your own head (may be happening right now). Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts cliché about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old cliché about quote the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.</blockquote><h3 id=\"%E2%80%9Cwhy-go-out%E2%80%9D-by-sheila-heti-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://www.sheilaheti.com/whygoout2/\">“Why Go Out?” by Sheila Heti</a> →</h3><blockquote>I’m always super-aware of how whenever I go out into the world, or whenever I get involved in a relationship, my idea of who I <em>think</em> I am utterly collides with the reality of who I actually am. And I continue to go out even though who I am always comes up short. I always prove myself to be less generous, less charming, less considerate, not as bold or energetic or intelligent or courageous as I imagined in my solitude. And I’m always being insulted, or snubbed, or disappointed.</blockquote><blockquote>And yet, in some way, maybe this is better. Each of us could suffer the pangs of withdrawal from other people and gain the serenity of the non-smoker. We could be demi-gods in our little castles, all alone, but perhaps, deep down, none of us really wants that. Maybe the only cure for self-confidence and courage is humility. Maybe we go out <em>in order </em>to<em> </em>fall short, because we want to learn how to be <em>good</em> at being people, and moreover, because we want to <em>be </em>people.</blockquote><h3 id=\"%E2%80%9Chow-to-live-on-twenty-four-hours-a-day%E2%80%9D-by-arnold-bennett-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://dev.misuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/ebooks/bennett_arnold_how_to_live_on_24_hours_a_day.pdf\">“How to Live on Twenty-Four Hours a Day” by Arnold Bennett</a> →</h3><blockquote>A failure or so, in itself, would not matter, if it did not incur a loss of self-esteem and of self-confidence. But just as nothing succeeds like success, so nothing fails like failure. Most people who are ruined are ruined by attempting too much. Therefore, in setting out on the immense enterprise of living fully and comfort- ably within the narrow limits of twenty-four hours a day, let us avoid at any cost the risk of an early failure. I will not agree that, in this business at any rate, a glorious failure is better than a petty success. I am all for the petty success. A glorious failure leads to nothing; a petty success may lead to a success that is not petty.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>You, my reader with a keen eye, must have noticed that this issue <em>looks</em> slightly different. It does because I have moved my newsletters to the Ghost platform. Without going too much into details, let us just say that I wanted to challenge myself to write more long-form essays. I do plan to do that on Ghost.</p><p>I have published below essays since I delivered the last issue of the newsletter.

				"title": "No Blogging Platform is Perfect",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>The real test for any blogging platform is how simple it makes it to write from both a desktop and a mobile device. I have come to realize that no platform does it perfectly.</p><p>I look for these features in an editor from any platform before I select it. It needs to have a simple editor that works well for posts of any length, works well from a device of any form. It needs to support building drafts before posts are published. It needs to support a simple editing workflow. That's it. And even these simple needs are not fulfilled by a single platform.</p><p>WordPress has a decent mobile app, supporting all the necessary features of the platform. But the Gutenberg block editor is so convoluted to work with even on desktops that working with it on a mobile device is an absolute pain. It has too many bells and whistles that a blogger with simple text writing needs rarely uses. It is good to capture the ideas in short and expand on them on a desktop. No wait, the editor is pain even on desktop.</p><p>The static site generators like Hugo, Jekyll, Eleventy etc. need a CMS to be tacked on to them. Sure, you can choose a CMS of your choice, but for me, the experience never worked well. I have tried multiple static site generators, but the overall publishing workflow is unnecessarily complicated for my simple needs.</p><p>Of course, there is always an option to use a text editor of your choice on your machine and publish the posts from the editors – if the integration exists for your selected platform that is. But that works best when you draft a post from a single machine. For me, that's typically not the case. For example, just this post has been written across three different devices – a web-based CMS is a must for me.</p><p>Another promising option is connecting to IndieWeb and using any Micropub clients to publish to your sites. But unfortunately, after years of enabling all my sites with IndieWeb components and publishing via Micropub clients, I have come to realize that none is, by design, a CMS in any form. I find them lacking in supporting creation of drafts to work on later or editing of existing posts.</p><p>Sure, it has all the definitions for you to build such a system over, but that's an unnecessary overhead that I am not ready to sign up for.</p><p>Micro.blog simplies hosting of a simple blog. It has a pretty decent iOS app, and a suite of well-defined APIs. A few third-party apps have already been build over those APIs. But the platform lacks a good editor – its editor is too basic for any post longer than a regular micro post. Sure, it works. But barely. On a mobile device, it does not work at all. The recommendation seems to be to use any of the mobile apps, but they all lack the features I need.</p><p>When I moved my blog to Micro.blog, I had published <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/2020/10/27/224951.html\">this concern</a>.</p><blockquote>I wonder if I would be ok to post mainly from mobile, but as a regular micropub post. WordPress always allowed me to post so much more. I am not sure what m.b allows. It should be good enough, but is it really? That would be a test.</blockquote><p>Unfortunately, I have realized that the platform doesn't pass that test, wholly. The editing experience remains poor for the long form posts – both from a desktop and a mobile device. It's a great system with a promising base, but still has a long way to go before I can use it for the longer form content.</p><p>So where does this leave me?</p><p>I have been struggling a lot from the beginnning to find that one good platform that addresses all my needs mentioned above. But, unfortunately, I have failed to find a single one that does all the aspects well. I love Micro.blog as it solves my simple needs of hosting with a no-nonsense platform for blog. It works great for micro posts – I can live with the mobile workflow for such short posts.</p><p>And I have recently fallen in love with Ghost for the long-form needs. It has a great editor on both the desktop and mobile devices, it has a brilliant CMS for my drafting and editing needs and is a solid platform all-round that I can host myself. WordPress failed big time in that aspect.</p><p>So, at least for the foreseeable future, here's how my posting is going to be. Micro.blog for micro-posts. Self-hosted Ghost for long-form posts, that includes my newsletter.</p><p><strong>Why a special space for long-form writing you may ask?</strong></p><p>I believe the choice of your blogging platform affects the type of posts you write. If the writing experience you have with a platform does not suit a particular form, you will invariably <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/2021/07/20/i-dislike-the.html\">stop writing those posts</a>. </p><p>My love for writing words is satiated only by the long-form posts. That love is also the reason why I started writing on the web in the first place. I can't stop writing them just because the platform I choose <em>for my convinience</em> does not support such writing well.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Isn't it odd that we can't decide on a consistent content rating system across all the countries? I know I <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/2020/11/12/i-dont-understand.html\">have ranted about this</a> a many times before this. But I just can't wrap my head around the fact that we, supposedly smart humans, haven't figured out a way yet to addresses such a trivial aspect of our film watching experience.</p>\n<p>\n  How difficult is it to say that this content is made for children 6 years and above? Or 13 years and above?\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>\n  I know. I'm ignoring the fact that all nations are not governed the same. They have individual definitions and expectations of freedom. Oversimplifying the problem at hand may not take us anywhere. The least I can do at least is to check <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_picture_content_rating_system\">which countries handle this rating problem the best</a>. \n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>\n  I find it fascinating that Turkey has the simplest content rating system. These are the rating — <i>General Audience, 6+, 10+, 13+, 16+, 18+</i>. Austria is in the same league — <i>Unrestricted, 6, 10, 12, 14, 16</i>. Russia's not too far behind, too — <i>0+, 6+, 12+, 16+, 18+</i>. \n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>India has a simple range — <i>U, UA, A, S</i>. But those characters are meaningless. How is one to map them to the age of the child?</p>\n<p>United States follows an even more muddled system — <i>G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17</i>. That's complication is unnecessary. It's unfortunate that those are the ratings that are most widely followed.</p>\n<p>\n  A couple of curious cases. South Africa has these categories — <i>A, PG, 7–9PG, 10–12PG, 13, 16, 18, X18, XX</i>. Plus these sub-descriptors — <i>S, L, V, P, N, H, D, SV</i>. Wow! I am sure a significant post-production budget goes towards arriving at the right rating for a film.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>And finally, of course, China. It has no official rating system. There are only two categories — suitable for all ages and banned.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\n  Here are a few additional observations and a proposal. 6, 16 and 18 are the most commonly agreed boundaries for the films. Only a few countries have any ranges beyond 18.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>\n  So, if we manage to find an agreeable boundary between 6 ad 16, we should be able to cover major countries with these ratings — \n  <i><b>0+, 6+, 12+, 16+, 18+</b></i>\n  . I am sure folks smarter than me will find a better way of conveying all why this system should work. Or convince me why this will never work.\n  <br />\n</p>\n",

All my drafts are one line ideas in my notebook or saved articles with tags \"to-write\". I find time for writing and complete a post about an idea or article.</p>\n<p>\n  For that matter, most of my posts are spontaneous -- I get a thought and I put it down into a post. I don't insert too many images, individual or as part of the posts. Sure, there are times when I need to spend time on researching or explaining some projects that I am working on. Or when I am writing a fiction. Such posts are very rare, though (and continue to become even rarer as the time goes on).\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>Plus, I like writing in Markdown. But I am not too attached to the language. I could very well go about writing posts after posts without using any of the Markdown syntax. The most I do is emphasize a word or a line. It won't matter to me how I do it. That said, I continue to enjoy writing my post in Markdown editors and would do that wherever I get a chance.</p>\n<p>There was a time when all my posts originated in some text editor installed on my laptop. But that's not the case any more. Most of the posts that I write are in a portal of sorts hosted on web - mainly <a href=\"quill.p3k.io/\">Quill</a>. (I wish Micro.blog had a better writing interface, though. The current one is too basic and doesn't work well for longer posts). On a mobile device, I only write microposts and I would post them from some Micropub client -- I use Micro.blog apps (Gluon or Dialog) or Indigenous.</p>\n<p>\n  All in all, I have realized I have a simple publishing workflow. I open a web or mobile app, put down my thoughts and hit publish. So, what use do I have for the text editors any more?\n  <br />\n</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Hello Friend,</p><p>My daughter recently learnt how to ride a bicycle. I spent two weeks making her follow the basics, inspiring her to give up on the fear of falling. I had marked the first week to convince her that falling is how she will learn not to stay down. She should learn to get up and pedal again. <em>It’s OK if you fall, you won’t cherish the efforts otherwise.</em></p><p>Once she had that thought imbibed, all I had to do was hold her and run along. I ran like crazy, like I had not in ages. I ran, and then I ran some more. Until one fine morning when I let her loose and saw her pedal along. I jogged next to her, a proud smile on my face. In being a parent, I was reliving a phase of my childhood.</p><p>Yesterday, we rode our bicycles together, with her alongside me when we came across a kid learning with training wheels. I could read her eyes wonder<em> why didn’t I get those added wheels for balancing</em>. I planned to tell her that it would have taken her longer to learn with that support attached. My mind was already racing along, talking to her, telling her.</p><blockquote>The artificial sense of support holds you back, dear. Just like me running alongside you, never releasing you, will. I will always hold you back from riding away, from taking control of your path. I can make you aware of your fears, but it is you who has to surmount them.</blockquote><p>However, she never asked. I never said. Maybe, she already knew.</p><p>What are the training wheels in your life - supporting you but thereby preventing you from taking the flight? Anyway, with that said, here is a selection of three brilliant works of writing.</p><hr><h3 id=\"attitude-by-margaret-atwood-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://www.humanity.org/voices/commencements/margaret-atwood-university-toronto-speech-1983\">\"Attitude\" by Margaret Atwood</a> →</h3><blockquote>[N]obody ever tells you, but did you know that when you have a baby your hair falls out? Not all of it, and not all at once, but it does fall out. It has something to do with a zinc imbalance. The good news is that it does grow back in. This only applies to girls. With boys, it falls out whether you have a baby or not, and it never grows back in; but even then there is hope. In a pinch, you can resort to quotation, a commodity which a liberal arts education teaches you to treat with respect, and I offer the following: “God only made a few perfect heads, and the rest lie covered with hair.”</blockquote><h3 id=\"bookshop-memories-by-george-orwell-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/bookshop-memories/\">\"Bookshop Memories\" by George Orwell</a> →</h3><blockquote>Many of the people who came to us were of the kind who would be a nuisance anywhere but have special opportunities in a bookshop. For example, the dear old lady who ‘wants a book for an invalid’ (a very common demand, that), and the other dear old lady who read such a nice book in 1897 and wonders whether you can find her a copy. Unfortunately she doesn’t remember the title or the author’s name or what the book was about, but she does remember that it had a red cover. But apart from these there are two well-known types of pest by whom every second-hand bookshop is haunted. One is the decayed person smelling of old breadcrusts who comes every day, sometimes several times a day, and tries to sell you worthless books. The other is the person who orders large quantities of books for which he has not the smallest intention of paying.</blockquote><h3 id=\"the-danger-of-lying-in-bed-by-mark-twain-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Danger_of_Lying_in_Bed\">\"The Danger of Lying in Bed\" by Mark Twain</a> →</h3><blockquote>I could read of railway accidents every day–the newspaper atmosphere was foggy with them; but somehow they never came my way. I found I had spent a good deal of money in the accident business, and had nothing to show for it. My suspicions were aroused, and I began to hunt around for somebody that had won in this lottery. I found plenty of people who had invested, but not an individual that had ever had an accident or made a cent. I stopped buying accident tickets and went to ciphering. The result was astounding. THE PERIL LAY NOT IN TRAVELING, BUT IN STAYING AT HOME.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>Have any recommendations or feedback for me? I’d love to hear from you.

				"content_text": "<p>Hello Friend,</p><p>At the surface, this channel of communication feels so abstract. I don’t know whether you read this to the end; maybe you skim through for something of interest. Whatever <em>you</em> do, I feel as if I am writing a letter to an old friend. I bear no sense of entitlement just because I am writing an issue of a newsletter. On the contrary, I feel honoured that you allow space for my ripe thoughts in your inbox. I appreciate you taking the time, even if all you do is skim.</p><p>Anyway, I have, for many years, struggled to find time for things that matter, to make time for them in the routine. A routine that keeps getting tangled with each passing day. The problem has recently aggravated as I stay locked down at home, always connected. I pass the time without being aware of doing so. I know this isn’t healthy.</p><p>The book “Make Time” sets itself up with just that problem. It presents a set of tips and tricks “for improving focus, finding greater joy in your work, and getting more out of every day”. The self-help books tend to crow over whatever little they have to say. This one was among those rear ones that win me over by their simplicity. It <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/2021/04/25/i-finished-reading.html?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">inspired me</a> to bring in some simple changes to my routine.</p><p>To list a few, I follow a fixed sleep routine now; I exercise and meditate daily. My smartphone unlocks to a blank home screen with no apps, no widgets waiting to distract me. I spend not more than 2 hours on group meetings in a day. I am not letting others’ priorities run my day.</p><p>Every morning, I write down a highlight that will bring some sense of satisfaction to the day. Every evening, I log out from all my devices and spend a good hour or two with my family at a fixed time.</p><p>And the list goes on. In short, I desire to be conscious of how I spend my time. I have made many minor shifts in my routine in the last month. Do I see any gains? I am not judging yet. But I am leading my life at the very least.</p><p>Anyway, I hope this letter inspires you to contemplate whether you are doing the same with your life - <em>consciously living it</em>. With that said, here is a selection of three brilliant works of writing.</p><hr><h3 id=\"this-is-the-life-by-annie-dillard-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.billemory.com/dillard/dillard.html?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">\"This Is The Life\" by Annie Dillard</a> →</h3><blockquote>Who is your “everyone”? Chess masters scarcely surround themselves with motocross racers. Do you want aborigines at your birthday party? Or are you serving yak-butter tea? Popular culture deals not in its distant past, or any other past, or any other culture. You know no one who longs to buy a mule or be named to court or thrown into a volcano.</blockquote><blockquote>So the illusion, like the visual field, is complete. It has no holes except books you read and soon forget. And death takes us by storm. What was that, that life? What else offered? If for him it was contract bridge, if for her it was copyright law, if for everyone it was and is an optimal mix of family and friends, learning, contribution, and joy of making and ameliorating what else is there, or was there, or will there ever be?</blockquote><h3 id=\"against-joie-de-vivre-by-phillip-lopate-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B07_vmO6k034dUcwVl9WNm43TUk/view?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">\"Against Joie de Vivre\" by Phillip Lopate</a> →</h3><blockquote>The truth is, most wisdom is embittering. The task of the wise person cannot be to pretend with false naiveté that every moment is new and unprecedented, but to bear the burden of bitterness which experience forces on us with as much uncomplaining dignity as strength will allow. Beyond that, all we can ask of ourselves is that bitterness not cancel out our capacity still to be surprised.</blockquote><h3 id=\"on-running-after-one%E2%80%99s-hat-by-g-k-chesterton-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://essays.quotidiana.org/chesterton/running_after_ones_hat/?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">\"On Running After One’s Hat\" by G. K. Chesterton</a> →</h3><blockquote>Real pain, as in the case of being burnt at Smithfield or having a toothache, is a positive thing; it can be supported, but scarcely enjoyed. But, after all, our toothaches are the exception, and as for being burnt at Smithfield, it only happens to us at the very longest intervals. And most of the inconveniences that make men swear or women cry are really sentimental or imaginative inconveniences—things altogether of the mind. For instance, we often hear grown-up people complaining of having to hang about a railway station and wait for a train. Did you ever hear a small boy complain of having to hang about a railway station and wait for a train? No; for to him to be inside a railway station is to be inside a cavern of wonder and a palace of poetical pleasures. Because to him the red light and the green light on the signal are like a new sun and a new moon. Because to him when the wooden arm of the signal falls down suddenly, it is as if a great king had thrown down his staff as a signal and started a shrieking tournament of trains.</blockquote><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>Have any recommendations or feedback for me?

				"content_text": "<p>It was exactly a year ago that I had <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/2020/04/26/214000.html\">posted</a> my thoughts on <a href=\"https://qz.com/work/1836105/20-great-questions-to-ask-instead-of-how-are-you-doing-right-now/\">a few key questions</a>. The idea was to capture how I was doing right then. It was a welcome and much needed introspection. I didn't want to miss on the opportunity to revisit the answers from the last year and see what has changed.</p>\n<p>\n  It was a nice exercise. My thoughts a year back were so quite unfamiliar to what I am going through today. So, here's an update to the same set of questions. Again, I would love to hear how <i>you </i>are doing.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p> <strong>How are you taking care of yourself today?</strong> </p>\n<p>\n  Regular exercise and daily meditation. Reading a lot more fiction and non-fiction. I'm still listening to music and many audiobooks. Staying far away from news.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<strong>What part of your shelter-in-place residence have you come to appreciate the most?</strong> \n<p>\n  Garden at my home. The wooden swing at the top floor that overlooks the garden. \n  <br />\n</p>\n<strong>What surprising thing have you been stocking up on (that isn’t toilet paper)?</strong> \n<p>\n  Biscuits. Lots of them.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<strong>What’s a story — from a book, a movie, an article, a conversation — that you’ve been gripped by recently? Why did it capture you?</strong> \n<p>\n  Nothing grips me any more. Maybe I have grown numb?\n  <br />\n</p>\n<strong>What habit have you started, or broken, during the quarantine?</strong> \n<p>\n  I have stopped staying awake late into the Friday and Saturday nights. That was one habit I had, stay up late either mindlessly watching something or working on side projects.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>As an effect, I am following a pretty routine. Get a calming and wholesome sleep.</p>\n<p><strong>Which specific place in your neighborhood are you most looking forward to visiting once this is all over?</strong> </p>\n<p>\n  Again, every part of the neighbourhood. Especially malls and the restaurants.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<strong>What’s the easiest part about the quarantine?</strong> \n<p>\n  Getting bored. And getting creative.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<strong>What are some things you have realized that you don’t really need?</strong> \n<p>\n  Cash. And fancy clothes. What I wear at home is often good enough even outside.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<strong>What’s something you own that feels useful?</strong> \n<p>\n  Kindle. Headphones.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<strong>What is your COVID-19 nickname/alter-ego?</strong> \n<p>\n  Calm workaholic.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<strong>What problem—either yours, or something more global —do you wish you could solve?</strong> \n<p>\n  Global Stupidity. Political Divisiveness. Natural Selfishness.\n  <br />\n</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Hello Friend,</p><p>I hope you are in a healthy state of mind and body; the endless whirlpool of tragic tales from the pandemic-ridden world hasn’t pulled you down.</p><p>I lately focus a lot on my health, both physical and mental. My mind and body have endured a lot of stress in the past three months, making me realize the importance of staying fit. It was time that I took control and regain the lost energy.</p><p>Keeping up with such a resolution is not easy. My mind desires to wander; my body demands to lay back. <em>You are so tired; why do you want to exert yourself more? </em>It questions. And I have often given in to their desires and demands. Not this time, though.</p><p>For more than a month now, I have been on the lookout for ways to help myself with this fight. To find ways that work for me. To not give up on the resolve when the things that aren’t working out. I have read a series of articles and books that have helped many that I know. I am consciously implementing what they suggest, attempting before deciding.</p><p>Very often, I have fallen prey to prematurely make up my mind about the suggestions from others. <em>“I don’t share that surrounding. I am in such a different phase of my life. That’s too costly. Or too difficult. Or too stupid.” </em>My mind always finds some way to convince me why the suggested strategies won’t work. A month back, it was time for some introspection.</p><p>Is it not ironic that a tired mind and body doesn’t want to be taken care of?</p><p>Anyway, here’s a selection of this edition’s three brilliant works of writing. I hope they trigger some inspiration for your mind to churn a few happy, positive thoughts.</p><hr><h3 id=\"politics-and-the-english-language-by-george-orwell-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/\">\"Politics and the English Language\" by George Orwell</a> →</h3><blockquote>It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts. The point is that the process is reversible. Modern English, especially written English, is full of bad habits which spread by imitation and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the necessary trouble. If one gets rid of these habits one can think more clearly, and to think clearly is a necessary first step toward political regeneration: so that the fight against bad English is not frivolous and is not the exclusive concern of professional writers.</blockquote><h3 id=\"things-we-think-we-know-by-chuck-klosterman-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/features/chuck-klostermans-america/ESQ0307klosterman\">\"Things We Think We Know\" by Chuck Klosterman</a> →</h3><blockquote>We adore stereotypes, and we desperately need them to fabricate who we are (or who we are not). People need to be able to say things like, “All stereotypes are based on ignorance,” because expressing such a sentiment makes them enlightened, open-minded, and incredibly unpleasant. Meanwhile, their adversaries need the ability to say things such as, “Like it or not, all stereotypes are ultimately based in some sort of reality,” because that kind of semilogic can justify their feelings about virtually anything. Nobody really cares what specific stereotype they happen to be debating; what matters more is how that label was spawned, because that defines its consequence. It raises a fundamental query about the nature of existence: Is our anecdotal understanding of the world founded on naivete, or is it built on dark, unpopular truths?</blockquote><h3 id=\"once-more-to-the-lake-by-e-b-white-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://genius.com/E-b-white-once-more-to-the-lake-annotated\">\"Once More to the Lake\" by E. B. White</a> →</h3><blockquote>We had a good week at the camp. The bass were biting well and the sun shone endlessly, day after day. We would be tired at night and lie down in the accumulated heat of the little bedrooms after the long hot day and the breeze would stir almost imperceptibly outside and the smell of the swamp drift in through the rusty screens. Sleep would come easily and in the morning the red squirrel would be on the roof, tapping out his gay routine. <a href=\"https://genius.com/E-b-white-once-more-to-the-lake-annotated\">I kept remembering everything, lying in bed in the mornings–the small steamboat that had a long rounded stern like the lip of a Ubangi</a>, and how quietly she ran on the moonlight sails, when the older boys played their mandolins and the girls sang and we ate doughnuts dipped in sugar, and how sweet the music was on the water in the shining night, and what it had felt like to think about girls then.</blockquote><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>Have any recommendations or feedback for me? I’d love to hear from you. Just hit reply, or you can even <a href=\"mailto:amit.w.gawande@gmail.com\">email me.</a></p><p>Thank you for reading and <em>sharing</em>.</p><p>-<em>Amit</em></p><p></p><p></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>\n  Music is the only time machine out there. You come across a song or an album, and a flood of memories and emotions come rushing at you. You almost relive those priceless moments. Exaggeration? I think not.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>You get transported back to the time when you listened to that song the first time. Or when you spent hours and days crooning along, the album on repeat mode. You vividly feel your surrounding from that time. The place you were at. The mental state you were in. <i>The happiness of loneliness</i>. Or the craziness with those few, old friends. You remember the moments that matter, the moments that are tucked deep within your heart.</p>\n<p>I am not saying anything groundbreaking here. Each one of us has experienced this ability of music. Many have worded it a lot more beautifully even.</p>\n<p>\n  I consider this a superpower and am reminded of this every few months. Most often, the time I hop back to is the early 2000s, the time that I cherish the most. It was a new phase of my student life. A period with a lot more independence. A period when my thoughts were moulded. Today was one such day. \n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>\n  A lesser-known <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2gh7v41s3eKkw5fTdfMEYR?si=m0cw1icYQM-Cvy67sPigOw\">A.R. Rahman album</a>. It's not even among one of his best. But it's close to me, though. I can't explain why; maybe the feeling of the songs resonated with what I was going through in my life. I didn't understand a word of those lyrics; it was the first non-Hindi, non-English album I listened to. But as they say, music has no language. And good music doesn't need words to convey an emotion.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>Sure, the album doesn't evoke the same feelings in me today. But I momentarily relive that unfamiliar phase of freedom every time. Just as I did today. </p>\n",

This weekend was one such occasion.</p>\n<p>For one, A. R. Rahman was going to be on the show as a guest. I love this man and his music. I won't miss a chance to watch the people contending to be good at singing attempt the maestro's brilliant tunes. The episode did not disappoint -- a contestant attempted one of the trickiest songs ever composed by Rahman, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clVEQrCXocg\">Satrangi Re</a>. </p>\n<p>As the performance came to an end (and the director decided to stuff it with unnecessary stuff), a little dialogue happened at our home. The contestant mentioned the first album he purchased was Rahman's, and he wanted Rahman's autograph on the old audio cassette. My daughter looked on with her curiosity piqued by watching the object the guy was holding. She genuinely asked, \"what's a cassette, dad?\"</p>\n<p>Boy, I had a nostalgic few minutes. I explained all about how I used to listen to songs when I was a child. I showed her the images of the audio cassettes, up close and afar. But you know what she was most interested in? Sony Walkman.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2021/de50c5fa3a.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"635\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I dearly wish I had not given away my Sony Walkman to one of my cousins. Sure, I had made her day by passing on the tech I did not need. But I loved my Walkman. And pleasing to see my daughter get fascinated by the beauty. And she has owned every type of iPod -- yet the retro-tech will always hold its charm.</p>\n<p>By the way, the contestant I mentioned above, Ashish Kulkarni, is too good a singer.

				"content_text": "<p>Hello Friend,</p><p>The last month was pretty exhausting for me. We had planned a family function at our home; the closest few were to gather after a long, long time. I would not have objected if we had delayed a get together of any form in these trying times of pandemic. However, this function was long overdue, and we could no longer avoid it. So with a slight uneasiness and a lot of uncertainty, we decided to go ahead with a smallish gathering.</p><p>Deep down, however, I was also anxiously awaiting to be surrounded by a few people after all. I wanted to take my mind away from the gloomy, saddening updates from the world over. This function lent the desired chance to do that. Isn’t it curious that the personal pressures allow you to be distracted, to momentarily stay aloof of the fact that the world around you is burning? Is it cynical? Selfish? Sure, it is. But sometimes selfishness is healthy for a burdened mind.</p><p>For a whole week, I was running around, planning for the event. I was exerting my body to the extreme. But the physical pain out of uninterrupted exertion is a lot less discomforting than the pain that any form of inertness inflicts on the mind.</p><p>As the day came to an end and I greeted adieus to my closest folks, I was left exhausted, but I had a big smile on my face. I felt a lot contented, at ease within. As if the difficult time had passed. So naive, yet freshening. If nothing else, I have accumulated a few memories that, surprisingly, aren’t blotted with the dull shadows of the pandemic.</p><p>Anyway, here’s a selection of this edition’s three brilliant works of writing. I hope they inspire you to word a few memories, a few uneasy thoughts of yours.</p><hr><h3 id=\"us-and-them-by-david-sedaris-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://legacy.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2004/jun/sedaris/usandthem.html\">\"Us and Them\" by David Sedaris</a> →</h3><blockquote>Because they had no TV, the Tomkeys were forced to talk during dinner. They had no idea how puny their lives were, and so they were not ashamed that a camera would have found them uninteresting. They did not know what attractive was or what dinner was supposed to look like or even what time people were supposed to eat. Sometimes they wouldn’t sit down until eight o'clock, long after everyone else had finished doing the dishes. During the meal, Mr. Tomkey would occasionally pound the table and point at his children with a fork, but the moment he finished, everyone would start laughing. I got the idea that he was imitating someone else, and wondered if he spied on us while we were eating.</blockquote><h3 id=\"%E2%80%9Cwhy-write%E2%80%9D-by-paul-auster-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/12/25/why-write?bxid=603f5e1eadfb3e5c2d381189&amp;cndid=63976050&amp;esrc=NYR_NEWSLETTER_TheNewYorkerThisWeek_217_SUB_SourceCode&amp;hasha=974dccbf118a9ee9846f4e9f16273ddd&amp;hashb=2e7d99c5217156b9d444f3ba82dec66826151414&amp;hashc=c0676801b83033dffafe5a20da91b23f26926ae8312e0303678dd3ad5ece83b0\">“Why Write?” by Paul Auster</a> →</h3><blockquote>It became a habit of mine never to leave the house without making sure I had a pencil in my pocket. It’s not that I had any particular plans for that pencil, but I didn’t want to be unprepared. I had been caught empty-handed once, and I wasn’t about to let it happen again. If nothing else, the years have taught me this: if there’s a pencil in your pocket, there’s a good chance that one day you’ll feel tempted to start using it. As I like to tell my children, that’s how I became a writer.</blockquote><h3 id=\"it%E2%80%99s-silly-to-be-frightened-of-being-dead-by-diana-athill-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/23/-sp-diana-athill-its-silly-frightened-being-dead\">\"It’s silly to be frightened of being dead\" by Diana Athill</a> →</h3><blockquote>I can’t remember when I read, or was told, that he [Montaigne] considered it a good thing to spend a short time every day thinking about death, thus getting used to its inevitability and coming to understand that something inevitable is natural and can’t be too bad, but it was in my early teens, and it struck me as a sensible idea. Of course I didn’t set out to think about death in a regular way every day, but I did think about it quite often, and sure enough, it worked. Why coming to see death’s naturalness should have caused belief in an afterlife to melt away, I am unsure, but it did. Probably that belief had been no more than an unexamined acceptance of something said by a grownup: in a child’s life there are many things more important to question than the probability of reuniting after death with other dead people – ideas that are tucked away on a back shelf of the mind like some object for which one has no use at present.</blockquote><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>Have any recommendations or feedback for me?

A male stork. The two mated and shortly afterward, the male stork left, as one would expect, being a migratory bird and all. But storks are also known for being serial monogamists; while they don’t mate for life, they tend to stick with the same partner so long as that partner is on the same migratory path. In this case, though, Malena had no migratory path, and the bird that happened across her nest seemed unlikely to return.</p>\n  <p>Until he did, a year later. And a year after that. And a year after that, too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n  Ah, love indeed is universal. And in this case, it literally has no boundaries. Such a pretty, happy story. To anyone who says long-distance relationship doesn't work, I have <i>another</i> real life story bookmarked now.\n  <br />\n</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Hello Friend,</p><p>After a prolonged slump in my productivity, I’ve been writing a lot more recently. I’m not sure what has brought in this change. Some alteration in the environment I write in had stimulated such a turn around in the past. A new keyboard. A new platform. Or a new place.</p><p>However, my selection of tools has hardly changed this time. <em>It’s never the tools,</em> I keep telling myself. Such tool-induced changes in habits are short-lived.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://automatter.substack.com/p/the-less-you-own-the-less-owns-you\">recent quote from Halle Kaplan-Allen</a> is pretty profound in that sense.</p><blockquote>The best tool to achieve any task is the one that you are going to stick by. Tool proliferation leads to increased complexity, and increased complexity leads to productivity paralysis.</blockquote><p>I recently came across a sudden surge of posts where a new tool inspired many people to get back to writing. Each person had a new idea that the said tool would help them in. <em>“The simplicity kills the friction; that should help me write more,”</em> goes the thought. That line of thinking should work, sure. But for the majority of us, our minds aren’t wired that way.</p><p>Judy Blume says, “you don’t write because you want to, but because you have to”. She is spot-on; I never <em>want</em> to write. I can’t force my mind to sit at the keyboard and fill the pages with words. I only write when I am emotionally involved in what I write. In short, I write best when I believe in what I am writing. Otherwise, all the words are hollow. The thoughts, meaningless. So, I welcome my recent creative phase.</p><p>Anyway, here’s a selection of this edition’s three brilliant works of writing. I hope they inspire you <em>to write as well as you can</em>.</p><hr><h3 id=\"a-personal-view-on-writing-%E2%80%93-by-judy-blume-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://judyblume.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/personal_view_judy_blume.pdf\">A Personal View on Writing – by Judy Blume</a> →</h3><blockquote>I once met a woman who wanted to write. She told me she’d read 72 books about writing but she still couldn’t do it. I suggested that instead of reading books about writing, she read the best books she could find, the books that would inspire her to write as well as she could.</blockquote><blockquote>Those of us who write do it because there are stories inside us burning to get out. Writing is essential to our well-being. If you’re that kind of writer, never give up! If you start a story and it isn’t going well, put it aside. (We’re not talking about school assignments here.) You can start as many as you like because you’re writing for yourself. With each story you’ll learn more. One day it will all come together for you.</blockquote><h3 id=\"the-perfection-of-the-paper-clip-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/05/the-history-of-the-paper-clip-it-was-invented-in-1899-it-hasnt-been-improved-upon-since.html\">The Perfection of the Paper Clip</a> →</h3><blockquote>Minimal, relentlessly plain, and instantly familiar to a contemporary eye even in an advertisement from 1894, its persistence has made the paper clip the epitome of the disposable, anonymous, manufactured object. It is made for secretaries, for assistants, for subordinates and gofers. It only became most useful once there were millions of pieces of paper that had to be grouped, but that also had to be taken apart again. The staple may contain more potential for physical harm, but the threat of the paper clip is Sisyphean: once you’ve clipped the papers together, you’re probably going to have to unclip them, and then clip together some others, and then unclip those and keep going until you retire, or you get that break in your acting career. Perhaps if Microsoft had chosen an object less reminiscent of mindless toil, the optimism of its much-loathed Clippy office assistant would have seemed less demented, and thus less prime for ridicule.</blockquote><h3 id=\"how-to-tell-a-story-and-others-%E2%80%93-by-mark-twain-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3250/3250-h/3250-h.htm\">How to Tell a Story and Others – by Mark Twain</a> →</h3><blockquote>The humorous story is told gravely; the teller does his best to conceal the fact that he even dimly suspects that there is anything funny about it; but the teller of the comic story tells you beforehand that it is one of the funniest things he has ever heard, then tells it with eager delight, and is the first person to laugh when he gets through. And sometimes, if he has had good success, he is so glad and happy that he will repeat the “nub” of it and glance around from face to face, collecting applause, and then repeat it again. It is a pathetic thing to see.</blockquote><blockquote>Very often, of course, the rambling and disjointed humorous story finishes with a nub, point, snapper, or whatever you like to call it. Then the listener must be alert, for in many cases the teller will divert attention from that nub by dropping it in a carefully casual and indifferent way, with the pretence that he does not know it is a nub.</blockquote><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>Have any recommendations or feedback for me?

				"content_text": "<p>Hello Friend,</p><p>It’s been a while since I published the last issue. For me, neither 2020 signed off on a high note nor 2021 started with a blast. The many unwanted bumps through the challenging past three months forced me to push the reset across my projects.</p><p>Anyway, I plan to revive this newsletter, and I intend to call this an unrelated sequel to the original run. The first volume was <em>about</em> and <em>for</em> the writers, whereas I target a slightly wider audience with this reincarnation.</p><p>Each new volume of anything generally diverges on the theme; this one is no different. I’ve covered all the aspects I’d planned for the first volume of this newsletter, the one I had tagged as “a writer’s toolkit”. It is disrespectful on my part then to publish something that does not excite me - it cannot be engaging for you, the reader.</p><p><strong>What changes can you expect, then?</strong></p><p>Well, the soul stays the same. It’s the content and the context that changes. Each issue will still feature three fantastic works of writing, but I won’t restrict them to be <em>only about and around writing</em>. They will be curious at most times. At times, they will be profound. But engrossing they will be every single time.</p><p>With that said, here are the three featured writings for this week.</p><hr><h3 id=\"advice-to-youth-by-mark-twain-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://people.virginia.edu/~jdk3t/TwainAY.htm\">\"Advice to Youth\" by Mark Twain</a> →</h3><blockquote>Always obey your parents, when they are present. This is the best policy in the long run, because if you dont, they will make you. Most parents think they know better than you do, and you can generally make more by humoring that superstition than you can by acting on your own better judgment.</blockquote><h3 id=\"joy-by-zadie-smith-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://theessayexperiencefall2013.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/files/2013/09/Joy-by-Zadie-Smith.pdf\">\"Joy\" by Zadie Smith</a> →</h3><blockquote>“You’re being the dog,” our child said recently, surprising us. She is almost three and all our private languages are losing their privacy and becoming known to her. Of course, we knew she would eventually become fully conscious, and that before this happened we would have to give up arguing, smoking, eating meat, using the Internet, talking about other people’s faces, and voicing the dog, but now the time has come, she is fully aware, and we find ourselves unable to change. “Stop being the dog,” she said,“it’s very silly,” and for the first time in eight years we looked at the dog and were ashamed.</blockquote><h3 id=\"go-gentle-into-that-good-night-by-roger-ebert-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/roger-ebert/go-gentle-into-that-good-night\">\"Go Gentle Into That Good Night\" by Roger Ebert</a> →</h3><blockquote>“Kindness” covers all of my political beliefs. No need to spell them out. I believe that if, at the end of it all, according to our abilities, we have done something to make others a little happier, and something to make ourselves a little happier, that is about the best we can do. To make others less happy is a crime. To make ourselves unhappy is where all crime starts. We must try to contribute joy to the world. That is true no matter what our problems, our health, our circumstances. We must try. I didn’t always know this, and am happy I lived long enough to find it out.</blockquote><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>Have any recommendations or feedback for me? I’d love to hear from you. Just hit reply, or you can even <a href=\"mailto:amit.w.gawande@gmail.com\">email me.</a></p><p>Thank you for reading and <em>sharing</em>.</p><p>-<em>Amit</em></p><p></p><p></p>\n",

When we could spread our lips in a smile at someone, and <em>say so much unsaid</em>.</p><p>I am struggling to do that these days. I do smile, but I am not confident that the feeling touches the person. Or he or she reciprocates it.</p><p>I have heard our eyes convey our feelings. Convey if we are smiling a happy smile. Or are discomfited. Or are pained. For that matter, they unveil even if we are unaffected, <em>disinterested</em>.</p><p>But how am I to know for sure if mine did? Or even if the eyes did, my \"friend\" could sense it? The whole situation is unfortunate. We were thrown blind into this pit without being armed with the proper knowledge to live through such limiting lives.</p><p>With our masks always on, we now have put our eyes under undue expectations.</p>\n",

And again, as has been the trend this year, the festivities are dampened by the phantom presence and talks of pandemic rampaging outside. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Each year, Ganesh Chaturthi, the long 10-day festival begins the season of festivals here in India. Everyone accepts that once the August dawns, it never is too long when we are already ringing the new year celebrations. We and our families are too busy with one festival after another. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This year the festivals did arrive, but the festivities were lacking. In India, we love celebrating our festivals outside, and with others. With our extended families and friends. We welcome them at home, and we don't hesitate to visit them and wish them loads of happiness.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So no surprise this year's festivals have been a lot different and a lot less fun. I understand the gravity of the situation that all us in the world find ourselves trapped in. But we Indians are known to dance away our fears and stresses together, as we celebrate our festivals.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From North to South, East to West of India, there are different names for the each (and at times the same) festival. But the purpose is common - celebrate the feeling of togetherness and of happiness that that togetherness brings to us. In that sense, this year has been dampening. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyway, Navratri began yesterday. Unlike each year, we are all working from home and hence have got a chance <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/slacking-at-hometown/\">to be with our parents</a>. Usually, my wife and my mother fast throughout these nine days of Navratri. They are not changing there routine, they will fast even this year. To keep me appreciative of how difficult that is, I have decided to fast today. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But the DJs blaring the loud sounds from the <em>pandals </em>set up for Garba are missing this year. Also missing are the endless debates between left and right on how we should stop spreading the noise pollution. Missing are the colourful stalls selling Gagra cholis and missing is the excitement of getting ready as per the colour schedule for each Garba night.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sure, I understand the reason for all the gloom and also realize that we have bigger problems in front of us. But I abhor this year because it's stripping away the opportunities from us to celebrate and gain the strength we need to face the problems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I'm tensed anytime I'm to touch my own face these days, especially if I don't have a hand wash or sanitizer around. I hate this crazy, fucking virus. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can stop eating particular meat or can boil &amp; reboil the water before drinking it. You can kill all the mosquitos around or have yourself bathed in repellant. But how the fuck do you not touch your own face? That's like asking your kid to not put herself in harm's way - she invariably will.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyway, with the bottled up frustration out of the way, my dislike for shopping for deodorant isn't new. So much so that it's no longer just a harmless dislike, it's a feeling of extreme hate. How the hell do you decide if a deodorant is good or not? I don't know how it's done at other places, but here in India, trying out a fragrance from a tester pack is pretty common while shopping for a deodorant. Everybody does it. Everybody apparent can do it. Except me. I never learned how to keep the fragrances separate. Once I've tried two, everything smells the same to my picky nose - you might as well make me smell the water and still get a comment from me after that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The way-out for me earlier was that I would only try a couple and select one from those. I can't say it always works - I end up choosing one that smells the worst. <em>Too strong or too mild or yuck. </em>These are the only reactions I get from my family. I haven't let that affect me until now - I have managed to convince myself that no one likes how the other smells. As long as I'm happy with how I smell - <em>or there's a complete lack of any form of smell for that matter</em> - I was fine. So I bought whatever smelled best for me or didn't smell at all from the two I tried.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This trial for fragrances is out of the picture in the pandemic times. There just are too many logistical problems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What's the other way then? You can for once judge a book by its cover or title, but there's no way one can judge a deodorant by its canister. I mean all fucking look the same. You can't select one because its nozzle opens up funny or the shape of the container is \"different\". The content isn't.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And what's with naming the fragrances? Dark Temptation, Sea Drift, Thunder Bolt, Regal Burst, Voyage. When every fragrance could be named as simply as \"strong\", \"mild\" and \"mildest\", fact that marketing would spend so much time and money to come up with these names makes no sense to me. How am I supposed to select between Dark Temptation and Gold Temptation?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And the money that marketing spends on the advertisement for men's deodorant must absolutely go down the drain. The only message they aim to deliver apparently is <em>put this on and be a magnet for girls</em>? Or be sensual? Or be \"irresistible\"? On the other hand, how can you even advertise for fragrance? The only thing you can say is it smells good.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Or simply strong, mild or mildest. I'm telling you, it is simple to solve this problem. Just use those names.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyway, I went shopping for deodorant today again. Looking at me struggling, toying around with all black canisters, the store owner pulled all the options away, kept one in front of me and said, \"you will love this, sir, trust me\". That won't have done it, but then he added, \"you will click a picture of this and come again next time asking for this one\".</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once I returned home with that deodorant, I minutely stared at my reflection in the mirror, wondering what <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/small-town-diaries-shopping/\">in the way I dressed</a> gave that store owner the feeling that I can't read English.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

It’s a short read, but it makes you pause and ponder over each idea. Just for Joy’s fascinating interpretation of the tale of a man’s fate and what that represents for a writer, I would bookmark this essay and reread it occasionally.</p><blockquote>A writer’s awareness must never be inadequate. Still, it will never be adequate to the greater awareness of the work itself, the work that the writer is trying to write. The writer must not really know what he is knowing, what he is learning to know when he writes, which is more than the knowing of it. A writer loves the dark, loves it, but is always fumbling around in the light. The writer is separate from his work but that’s all the writer is—what he writes. A writer must be smart but not too smart. He must be dumb enough to break himself to harness. He must be reckless and patient and daring and dull—for what is duller than writing, trying to write?</blockquote><h3 id=\"thoughts-on-writing-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.elizabethgilbert.com/thoughts-on-writing/\">Thoughts on Writing</a> →</h3><p>Each time I read this insightful post from Elizabeth Gilbert, I find a new advice that I had missed earlier. Every paragraph, every statement is a nice reminder for each writer, aspiring and established, to focus on what matters the most to keep writing. Elizabeth talks about how she herself got started writing, how every writer should handle rejections and yet should keep trying with unwavering desire to write more. <em>“It’s not the world’s fault that you want to be an artist…now get back to work” - </em>I’ve framed this blunt, yet effective, suggestion from Elizabeth on the wall opposite to my writing desk.</p><blockquote>Insanity is a very tempting path for artists, but we don’t need any more of that in the world at the moment, so please resist your call to insanity. We need more creation, not more destruction. We need our artists more than ever, and we need them to be stable, steadfast, honorable and brave – they are our soldiers, our hope. If you decide to write, then you must do it, as Balzac said, “like a miner buried under a fallen roof.” Become a knight, a force of diligence and faith. I don’t know how else to do it except that way.</blockquote><h3 id=\"the-ecstasy-of-influence-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://harpers.org/archive/2007/02/the-ecstasy-of-influence/\">The Ecstasy of Influence</a> →</h3><p>Jonathan Lethem succinctly and pointedly talks about the thin line between inspiration and plagiarism in the varied art forms. With an observation, that “literature has always been a crucible in which familiar themes are continually recast” and backing it by abundant examples, Jonathan goes on to speculate if there exists such a line at all.</p><blockquote>Most artists are brought to their vocation when their own nascent gifts are awakened by the work of a master. That is to say, most artists are converted to art by art itself. Finding one’s voice isn’t just an emptying and purifying oneself of the words of others but an adopting and embracing of filiations, communities, and discourses. Inspiration could be called inhaling the memory of an act never experienced. Invention, it must be humbly admitted, does not consist in creating out of void but out of chaos. Any artist knows these truths, no matter how deeply he or she submerges that knowing.</blockquote><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>Have any recommendations or feedback for me?

The Audible subscription has been one of the best investments. I enjoy listening to books as I am doing other tasks. Be it the regular household choir or exercising.

I enjoy reading mystery as a genre the most - in that <em>whodunit</em> has a special place in my mind. It is the most difficult genre to write effectively.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This short read falls in the category that Agatha Christie had mastered -- the story unravels itself for both the reader and the central characters together. Everything is laid out in front of the reader with nothing being held back by the \"intelligent\" detective. I hate the I-knew-it-all-along sort of twists. The mysteries that don't employ such ploys can leave you with satisfaction that is of the highest order.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is not the underlying mystery that charmed me though. It is the sincere presentation of Jewish culture in a small-town community of Barnard's Crossing, notwithstanding the humorous undertone that author Harry Kemelman maintains throughout. I loved the setting of the lovable town and the characters big and small - I connected with each one of them. I enjoyed the discussions that David Small gets into every now and then, for that matter right from the get-go when he untangles the middling mystery of a broken vehicle with his simple, basic yet effective method of listening. I knew right away that I was in for an enjoyable ride.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is an intelligent book with a common, sincere central character. He is not the only intelligent being around - each supporting character is important and equally worthy. I loved Rabbi Small's bantering with Chief Lanigan on topics both related and unrelated to the mystery. The later, equally smart, is not there just to hear the detective unravel the mystery towards the end. He is involved too. In that manner, this book is special.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I haven't been this engaged while reading a book, or to find what happens next since a long time now. And I don't remember the last time when I rushed to pick the second book in the series this soon.

As Ralph Waldo Emerson had aptly put it, “language is a city, to the building of which every human being brought a stone”. This is true not just for English, but for every other language in use today.</p><p>And yet, the exact origins of language as a notion are yet unknown.

There are of course attempts from linguists to explain how humans planned and worked this fascinating system out. Though Richard Nordquist from ThoughtCo. presents the theories from each of the viewpoints, the exact proofs, unlike <a href=\"https://www.getrevue.co/profile/amitgawande/issues/let-s-dwell-in-writing-history-258801?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">the origins of writing</a>, are yet to be found.</p><blockquote>Today, opinion on the matter of language origins is still deeply divided. On the one hand, there are those who feel that language is so complex, and so deeply ingrained in the human condition, that it must have evolved slowly over immense periods of time. Indeed, some believe that its roots go all the way back to <em>Homo habilis</em>, a tiny-brained hominid that lived in Africa not far short of two million years ago. On the other, there are those like [Robert] Berwick and [Noam] Chomsky who believe that humans acquired language quite recently, in an abrupt event. Nobody is in the middle on this one, except to the extent that different extinct hominid species are seen as the inaugurators of language’s slow evolutionary trajectory.</blockquote><h3 id=\"who-decides-what-words-mean-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/why-language-might-be-the-optimal-self-regulating-system?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">Who decides what words mean</a> →</h3><p>As fascinating as the history of the language is, the concept itself is no less bewildering. There is no designated body controlling any aspect of the numerous languages that are spoken today. The rules keep changing, the meanings keep evolving. Did you know that “unfathom” was only <a href=\"https://public.oed.com/updates/new-words-list-june-2020/?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">recently added to the Oxford English Dictionary</a>, and it means exactly what “fathom” does? It’s unfathomable how we humans communicate with one another, and yet unfathom the innate complexities of this self-regulating system.</p><blockquote>Language is a <em>system</em>. Sounds, words and grammar do not exist in isolation: each of these three levels of language constitutes a system in itself. And, extraordinarily, these systems change as systems. If one change threatens disruption, another change compensates, so that the new system, though different from the old, is still an efficient, expressive and useful whole.</blockquote><blockquote>Begin with sounds. Every language has a characteristic inventory of contrasting sounds, called phonemes. <em>Beet</em> and <em>bit</em> have different vowels; these are two phonemes in English. Italian has only one, which is why Italians tend to make homophones of <em>sheet</em> and <em>shit</em>.</blockquote><h3 id=\"the-worlds-most-efficient-languages-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/06/complex-languages/489389/?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">The World's Most Efficient Languages</a> →</h3><p>As English became the widely accepted official language of the nations across the world, the inefficiencies of this “global” language came to the fore. The more it adapted and relaxed the rules of the usage and the semantics, it risked losing the chance to become native for any community. “Just as fish presumably don’t know they’re wet, many English speakers don’t know that the way their language works is just one of endless ways it could have come out”. That’s how this wonderful essay at The Atlantic begins as it contrasts English’s efficiency, or the lack thereof, against a few native languages.</p><blockquote>Languages are strikingly different in the level of detail they require a speaker to provide in order to put a sentence together. In English, for example, here’s a simple sentence that comes to my mind for rather specific reasons related to having small children: “The father said ‘Come here!’” This statement specifies that there is a father, that he conducted the action of speaking in the past, and that he indicated the child should approach him at the location “here.” What else would a language need to do? Well, for a German speaker, more. In “<em>Der Vater sagte ‘Komm her!’”</em>, although it just seems like a variation on the English sentence, more is happening.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nd5cklw6d6Q?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>The Origins and Evolution of Language | Michael Corballis | TEDxAuckland</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"featured-writerjoanna-pearson\">Featured Writer - <a href=\"https://joannapearson.wordpress.com/?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">Joanna Pearson</a></h2><p>I recently read a wonderful short story “<a href=\"https://www.craftliterary.com/2020/07/24/summer-night-joanna-pearson/?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">Summer Night</a>” from Joanna published as part of Craft Magazine and, right away, I wanted to read a lot more from her. This one is such a brilliantly narrated mystery. You know right from the beginning that something is off with the characters and the environment, and yet you continue to read along.

Lewis</blockquote><p>We are surrounded by opportunities to fail at. We judge ourselves when we can’t meet societal expectations. Furthermore, we blame ourselves when we don’t fulfil our high aspirations. For creatives, the “fear of failure” is numbing - every such mind is then inundated with suggestions to overcome this fear. Ironically, the suggestions come from the same society whose unreasonable expectations label these minds as “failures”.</p><p>In this issue, I feature the essays that, in no way, preach how such fears can be, should be overcome. Rather, they attempt to persuade that it is all fine to fail.</p><hr><h2 id=\"featured-writing\">Featured Writing</h2><h3 id=\"falling-short-seven-writers-reflect-on-failure-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/22/falling-short-writers-reflect-failure\">Falling short: seven writers reflect on failure</a> →</h3><p>“Diana Athill, Margaret Atwood, Julian Barnes, Anne Enright, Howard Jacobson, Will Self and Lionel Shriver reflect on their disappointments in life, love and work”. It is a brilliant read for when the trying times drag you, your morale down. Everyone fails. Especially those who are known for their successes. I find the below passage from Anne Enright enlightening.</p><blockquote>I have no problem with failure - it is success that makes me sad. Failure is easy. I do it every day, I have been doing it for years. I have thrown out more sentences than I ever kept, I have dumped months of work, I have wasted whole years writing the wrong things for the wrong people. Even when I am pointed the right way and productive and finally published, I am not satisfied by the results. This is not an affectation, failure is what writers do. It is built in.</blockquote><h3 id=\"fail-better-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070503180159/http://faculty.sunydutchess.edu/oneill/failbetter.htm\">Fail better</a> →</h3><p>“What makes a good writer? Is writing an expression of self, or, as TS Eliot argued, ‘an escape from personality’? Do novelists have a duty? Do readers? Why are there so few truly great novels? Zadie Smith writes about literature’s legacy of honourable failure.”</p><blockquote>Map of disappointments - Nabokov would call that a good title for a bad novel. It strikes me as a suitable guide to the land where writers live, a country I imagine as mostly beach, with hopeful writers standing on the shoreline while their perfect novels pile up, over on the opposite coast, out of reach. Thrusting out of the shoreline are hundreds of piers, or “disappointed bridges”, as Joyce called them. Most writers, most of the time, get wet. Why they get wet is of little interest to critics or readers, who can only judge the soggy novel in front of them. But for the people who write novels, what it takes to walk the pier and get to the other side is, to say the least, a matter of some importance.</blockquote><h3 id=\"write-till-you-drop-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/03/28/specials/dillard-drop.html\">Write Till You Drop</a> →</h3><p>For a writer, every rejection, every failure is an opportunity to stop writing? <em>Why should I write when no one wants to read what I write? And what should I write about if anything that I write about doesn’t interest anyone? </em>The doubts are genuine, but to stop after such doubts cloud your mind is to be brutal on the creative mind. Annie Dillard lays out many ways that writers can trudge along through the difficult phases of self-scrutiny.</p><blockquote>One of the few things I know about writing is this: spend it all, shoot it, play it, lose it, all, right away, every time. Do not hoard what seems good for a later place in the book, or for another book; give it, give it all, give it now. The impulse to save something good for a better place later is the signal to spend it now. Something more will arise for later, something better. These things fill from behind, from beneath, like well water. Similarly, the impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful, it is destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_waBFUg_oT8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><h2 id=\"featured-writerandrea-bobotis\">Featured Writer - <a href=\"https://www.andreabobotis.com/\">Andrea Bobotis</a></h2><p>Author of a published novel, Andrea often writes short essays and stories.

The first is an inspiration to think of a way to put his or her thoughts, the ideas, into words. Another factor is the focus to sit down staring at the blinking cursor without getting lured by the myriads of easily accessible distractions. And the final one is the craft that the writer brings to the table, one that he or she horns and perfects over the year.</p><p>This issue features a few essays from the masters who have, over the years, learned to command the art by confronting each of these factors.

And apparently “out of my head” is not an acceptable answer for most.</p><blockquote>The ideas aren’t the hard bit. They’re a small component of the whole. Creating believable people who do more or less what you tell them to is much harder. And hardest by far is the process of simply sitting down and putting one word after another to construct whatever it is you’re trying to build: making it interesting, making it new. </blockquote><blockquote>But still, it’s the question people want to know. In my case, they also want to know if I get them from my dreams. And I don’t give straight answers. Until recently.</blockquote><h3 id=\"why-writers-are-the-worst-procrastinators-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/02/why-writers-are-the-worst-procrastinators/283773/\">Why Writers Are the Worst Procrastinators</a> →</h3><p>Everybody is a procrastinator, or most have been some time in their life. Megan Mcardle argues writers are a special kind; for them, being a procrastinator is “a peculiarly common occupational hazard”. Megan goes on to lay out why she is convinced that the writers are the worst. I always believed that the fear of doing something badly, <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/perfectionism-unhealthy/\">not perfectly</a>, is a prime driver for procrastination. But if the researchers are to be believed, the fear of doing nothing trumps the ills that perfectionism induces.</p><blockquote>I once asked a talented and fairly famous colleague how he managed to regularly produce such highly regarded 8,000 word features. “Well,” he said, “first, I put it off for two or three weeks. Then I sit down to write. That’s when I get up and go clean the garage. After that, I go upstairs, and then I come back downstairs and complain to my wife for a couple of hours. Finally, but only after a couple more days have passed and I’m really freaking out about missing my deadline, I ultimately sit down and write.</blockquote><blockquote>Over the years, I developed a theory about why writers are such procrastinators: We were too good in English class. This sounds crazy, but hear me out.</blockquote><h3 id=\"everything-you-need-to-know-about-writing-successfully-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://msu.edu/~jdowell/135/King_Everything.html\">Everything You Need to Know About Writing Successfully</a> →</h3><p>In this short essay, Stephen King delivers advice for any writer who wants to be successful at writing good fiction. King does that in his signature style – clear and direct.</p><blockquote>I know it sounds like an ad for some sleazy writers’ school, but I really am going to tell you everything you need to pursue a successful and financially rewarding career writing fiction, and I really am going to do it in ten minutes, which is exactly how long it took me to learn. It will actually take you twenty minutes or so to read this essay, however, because I have to tell you a story, and then I have to write a second introduction. But these, I argue, should not count in the ten minutes.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HzAtOyw6ACw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><h2 id=\"featured-writerneil-clark\">Featured Writer - <a href=\"https://neilclarkwrites.wordpress.com/\">Neil Clark</a></h2><p>“Then there was the romance between the carton of smoothie and me.” Neil begins his flash fiction “<a href=\"https://www.openpen.co.uk/ferris-wheel/\">Ferris Wheel</a>” with this amusing lead.

For some, it’s a getaway, a place they tip-toe into to gain a momentary respite from their daily grinds. For some, it’s a vast ocean of knowledge they dip their minds in to get enlightened. For writers, it can be both. <em>And </em>so much more.</p><p>This issue features a few essays that depict what libraries mean to a few writers and what, according to them, they should mean to everyone else.</p><hr><h2 id=\"featured-writing\">Featured Writing</h2><h3 id=\"why-our-future-depends-on-libraries-reading-and-daydreaming-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/15/neil-gaiman-future-libraries-reading-daydreaming\">Why our future depends on libraries, reading and daydreaming</a> →</h3><p>In this lecture explaining the importance of using our imaginations, and providing for others to use theirs, Neil Gaiman emphasizes on why it’s an obligation for all us, citizens, to support libraries and to inculcate the love for books among children, right from early ages. Highlighting first the significance of reading books, specifically fiction, he goes on to make one understand why it’s absurd to “perceive libraries as a shelf of books”.</p><blockquote>Libraries are about freedom. Freedom to read, freedom of ideas, freedom of communication. They are about education (which is not a process that finishes the day we leave school or university), about entertainment, about making safe spaces, and about access to information. I worry that here in the 21st century people misunderstand what libraries are and the purpose of them. If you perceive a library as a shelf of books, it may seem antiquated or outdated in a world in which most, but not all, books in print exist digitally. But that is to miss the point fundamentally.</blockquote><h3 id=\"a-library-is-many-things-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://lettersofnote.com/2011/05/06/a-library-is-many-things/\">A library is many things</a> →</h3><p>One would agree whole-heartedly with the title when it’s a mix of prominent personalities – an astronaut, a sci-fi writer, a painter, a cartoonist and a children’s author – convincing you about it. “Early-1971, in an effort to attract as many youngsters to the premises as possible, Marguerite Hart — children’s librarian at the newly opened public library in Troy, Michigan — wrote to a number of notable people with a request: to reply with a congratulatory letter, addressed to the children of Troy, in which the benefits of visiting such a library were explained.” From among the responses from the likes of Neil Armstrong, Isaac Asimov, and Dr Seuss, here’s a snippet from the letter from E. B. White.</p><blockquote>A library is many things. It’s a place to go, to get in out of the rain. It’s a place to go if you want to sit and think. But particularly it is a place where books live, and where you can get in touch with other people, and other thoughts, through books. If you want to find out about something, the information is in the reference books—the dictionaries, the encyclopedias, the atlases. If you like to be told a story, the library is the place to go. Books hold most of the secrets of the world, most of the thoughts that men and women have had. And when you are reading a book, you and the author are alone together—just the two of you.</blockquote><h3 id=\"my-manhattan-not-just-a-library-an-oasis-of-civilization-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/12/arts/my-manhattan-not-just-a-library-an-oasis-of-civilization.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm\">My Manhattan; Not Just a Library, an Oasis of Civilization</a> →</h3><p>Susan Jacoby’s love letter to New York Public Library, particularly its newly restored main reading room and its Center for Scholars and Writers. As she recounts the time that she spent in the library as the world changed outside, you can’t help but wonder if there’s any other apt description for this place than “an oasis of civilization” as she refers.</p><blockquote>In a compartmentalized and bureaucratized American academic culture, the library is one of the last bastions of respect for those who try to carry on an older but increasingly archaic tradition of independent scholarship embodied by men like Kazin. My current research is concerned with the marginalization of secularism and free thought – the lovely, anachronistic term that appeared at the end of the 17th century – in American history. The range of the library’s holdings on this quirky and controversial subject has given me a new appreciation of the courage and vision of past generations of New York librarians, who collected material without regard for the received religious and political opinion of their time.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YsA_JTeHJ6A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><h2 id=\"featured-writerlena-valencia\">Featured Writer - <a href=\"http://www.lenavalencia.com/\">Lena Valencia</a></h2><p>A writer, editor and a teacher, Lena has published many short stories as part of publications and anthologies; one among them is the brilliant short story <a href=\"https://www.craftliterary.com/2019/03/29/mystery-lights-valencia/\">Mystery Lights </a>published at CRAFT magazine.

				"content_text": "<blockquote>“One technology doesn’t replace another, it complements. Books are no more threatened by Kindle than stairs by elevators.” – Stephen Fry</blockquote><p><em>People who love books and reading cannot love eBooks, </em>goes the adage. Penelope Lively calls them “some sort of bloodless nerd”. So much has been written and published by the authors and the public in general on their love for the specific forms of the books. Some people have had contrasting thoughts; talking about eBooks, Douglas Adams had famously said that one should “not confuse the plate for the food”. But he had also quipped that “we notice e-book readers, we don’t notice books”.</p><p>So, what is it, then? This issue features a few well-written essays that talk about the partisan debates around the different forms of the books, starting with their evolution over the years. I want to remain unbiased; I will try to be that. After all, I am just the guy serving the plates; it’s the food on those plates that matters.</p><hr><h2 id=\"featured-writing\">Featured Writing</h2><h3 id=\"the-evolution-of-the-book-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://sfbook.com/the-evolution-of-the-book.htm\">The Evolution of the book</a> →</h3><p>With a fascinating look at how books have evolved over the years from “the clay tablets to the e-book format,” SFBook Review presents a snapshot of the publishing history. “As books have now reached the 21st century with the creation of the increasingly popular e-book, we thought it would be a good idea to take a look back at the long and involved history of the humble book.” Here’s a snippet on the birth of the “cheap” novel.</p><blockquote>With the continued spread of the written word, along with a growth in education and the continued reduction in print costs, the first mass-market paperbacks were born. In Britain there were two distinct markets these mass publications were aimed at, the juvenile market with the “story papers” and the working class adult which were known as a “penny dreadful”, “penny number” or a “penny blood” - due to the fact that they each cost a “penny”. Eventually these novels were exclusively aimed at the working class youth market and the term story paper became interchangeable with penny dreadful.</blockquote><p>Equally insightful is the <a href=\"https://www.voices.com/blog/_evolution_of_audiobooks_continued/\">evolution of audiobooks</a>. Did you know that the first audiobook was recorded in 1952?</p><h3 id=\"ebooks-v-paper-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53d3096a-f792-11e3-90fa-00144feabdc0\">Ebooks v paper</a> →</h3><p>Undoubtedly, the individual preference of a form of the book matters the most. Nonetheless, the heartily debated topic, a cultural divide of sorts, is researched equally well, forcing us to rethink how we respond to the written word. Which form does our brains prefer? Financial Times has a detailed write-down of the physical effects of the increased screen times or connectivity associated with the eBooks; at the same time, it also presents more emotional or the psychological aspects associated with the inherent differences of the media forms.</p><blockquote>As researchers examine the differences reading in different media make, they are also having to distinguish carefully between the different things that we do when we read. Take, for instance, the difference between “deep reading”, when you really get immersed in a text, and “active learning”, when you make notes in margins or put down the book to cross-reference with something else.</blockquote><h3 id=\"listening-to-books-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/listening-to-books/?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">Listening to Books</a> →</h3><p>In this love letter to audiobooks, Maggie Gram confesses her love, her liking for audiobooks and attempts to address the criticisms that this format of the books receives. Is reading the only <em>true</em> form of reading? Or “reading is only reading when it requires the constant assertion of will,” as many critics of the medium might say.  That’s the question, the disapproval that Maggie attempts to answer in this heartfelt essay. </p><blockquote>Less dude-like people, people less invested in making fun of you, will just cock their heads to the side and ask you why you do it. As if liking books were not enough! As if it weren’t the best thing in the world to have someone read to you! <em>As if you had something better to do!</em> I thought about starting this essay by insisting that I listen to audio books <em>for work</em>, so that I could not be mistaken for that other kind of person, that kind of person who listens audio books because it brings her some kind of unsophisticated pleasure. I am not, I wanted you to know, your Aunt Paula. My kitchen is not decorated with rooster towel racks and rooster potholders and rooster trim.

With some brilliant analogies and flirty humour, she brings a smile to your face; makes you pause and read the passage again at various points. I couldn’t word the recommendation better than the Halimah Marcus. “Read this story to find out what the breakdown of social order in a marriage looks like. Read this story to find out whether the cat lives or dies. Read this story to take your arguments a little less seriously, and to cherish the paradoxical moments, as with Schrödinger’s cat, when you both get to be right.</p><h2 id=\"featured-toolthe-libby-app-by-overdrive\">Featured Tool - <a href=\"https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/\">The Libby App by OverDrive</a></h2><p>A library is many things; it has adapted itself with changing times and is now a lot more.

I have rarely used that adjective for a documentary. But this one is so very different. I cannot fathom someone's possession for their passion can blind them to the risks rather conspicuous to the rest. I was aware of the free soloing as a form of climbing. What took me by surprise was the level of planning that goes into the preparation.

The single-take narration grips one right from the beginning and never lets off even for a moment. I was with the characters throughout their journey, feeling their anxiety, their pain. I entered every new terrain, turned every dark corner equally uneasy. What Mendes and his cinematographer Roger Deakins manage to achieve is absolute brilliance.

The upgrade also offers full-text search which comes handy when finding that one article that talked about some peculiar topic. The biggest draw was the unlimited highlighting. The 3 highlights that the free option offered was limiting when each long read that I saved was full of thoughts worthy of absorption and introspection.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have paid for a year; the pricing that it offers in-app is worth my current extent of the use of the service.

Or maybe my surrounding, my current lifestyle is too chaotic to lend me space, the time to meditate. Thoughts always rush into my mind. From work. From home. From things done well. From things not yet done. I would never get into the zone where I am listening to my breathing. Maybe I am just too distracted within.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And the fact that meditation can probably help me overcome that inattention is also why it is even more frustrating that I can't appreciate this practice. I have heard many people claim how meditation calms their mind. Get the clarity of thoughts. Focus. So I feel this can help me be not this distracted. But then while I am meditating, I feel helpless to control how my mind wanders around. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have tried multiple apps. I have tried guided sessions. Nothing seems to help. At times, I am even judging the voice that guides me.

Or catching up on my read later lists. Or writing. Or working on the short story in progress. Nothing. I spent the whole two days lying on my sofa, enjoying a movie marathon with my family. I did all that without judging myself, as <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/slow-down-be-present/\" target=\"_blank\">I had recently decided</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's <em>so </em>easy to idle the whole days away.

Time, then, is spent generously lazying around, scoring easy joys.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The thought also reminds of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://getpocket.com/explore/item/a-lazy-person-s-guide-to-happiness\" target=\"_blank\">this exchange</a> between Dan Buettner and James Hamblin during one of their interviews.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Buettner</strong>: In the long-term view, you’re better off buying experiences than some new gadget.

And if I buy a couch, I have it for years.</p><p><strong>Buettner</strong>: But the joy from the couch wears out.

We should judge if the activity is an experience by the longevity of the satisfaction it brings. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There's no doubt that a whole day of movie marathon can lend momentary joy. But does it do that without being a burden on your mind? If so, then it is an experience.

More than being an essay about a brief on punctuation, it details the history of punctuation, its relevance before and after the introduction of printing, and the recent trends in the use of punctuation. Dr. Nordquist has it all covered.</p><blockquote>The beginnings of punctuation lie in classical rhetoric—the art of oratory. Back in ancient Greece and Rome, when a speech was prepared in writing, marks were used to indicate where—and for how long — a speaker should pause. Until the 18th century, punctuation was primarily related to spoken delivery (elocution), and the marks were interpreted as pauses that could be counted out.</blockquote><h3 id=\"the-comma-from-which-my-heart-hangs-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/the-comma-from-which-my-heart-hangs\">The Comma From Which My Heart Hangs</a> →</h3><p>Benjamin Samuel at McSweeney’s Internet Tendency describes the great power comma possesses in our writing. Backing his argument with some pertinent examples, he delivers his point with an abundance of wit and tinge of humor that is a signature of every article at McSweeney’s.</p><blockquote>If nothing else, one ought to know how to treat a comma. Abandonment or abuse of the comma muddles discourse, and this lack of respect is akin to neglect, to a lack of appreciation, to an unreasonable rejection of the very foundation of all worthy human interactions. (…) It simply cannot be said too often that punctuation, not just the noble comma, is crucial to communication and comprehension. Truly, a poorly constructed sentence can set worlds crumbling, can alter perceptions irreparably.</blockquote><h3 id=\"tips-on-grammar-punctuation-and-style-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/tips-grammar-punctuation-and-style\">Tips on Grammar, Punctuation and Style</a> →</h3><p>“If the rules you learned about commas and semi-colons don’t mean much to you, forget them and try this.” That is how Kim Cooper begins this helpful guide on punctuation published for Writing Center at Harvard University. This is a handy list of suggestions on how one can check the selection of punctuation like commas and semi-colons, dashes and hyphens as part of her writing.</p><blockquote>If you don’t want your reader to pause, there shouldn’t be a comma, there, because as, this demonstrates it’s very difficult to figure, out, what you’re saying when your punctuation, makes the sentence unreadable. Your sentences shouldn’t leave your reader hyperventilating from the constant shallow breaths that over-punctuation requires. Nor should they be gasping for breath at the end of a long, unpunctuated sentence. (Consider yourself responsible for your readers’ cardiovascular health.)</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OV5J6BfToSw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><hr><h2 id=\"featured-writercaleb-tankersley\">Featured Writer - <a href=\"https://calebtankersley.com/\">Caleb Tankersley</a></h2><p>Caleb published a short dark story “<a href=\"https://www.carvezine.com/story/summer-2020-tankersley\">Swarm Creatures</a>” as part of Carve magazine’s Summer 2020 edition.

It is his apt belief that “every human being on this planet has at least one good story to tell his neighbor” that <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/we-should-all-write/?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">I firmly associate with</a>.</p><p>In this essay, he reflects “on some important items in the process of creating a text”.</p><blockquote>Above all else, the writer has to be a good reader. The kind that sticks to academic texts and does not read what others write (and here I’m not just talking about books but also blogs, newspaper columns and so on) will never know his own qualities and defects.</blockquote><blockquote>So, before starting anything, look for people who are interested in sharing their experience through words. I’m not saying: “look for other writers”. What I say is: find people with different skills, because writing is no different from any other activity that is done with enthusiasm.</blockquote><h3 id=\"how-to-write-with-style-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://kmh-lanl.hansonhub.com/pc-24-66-vonnegut.pdf?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">How to Write with Style</a> →</h3><p>Here’s Kurt Vonnegut again with a few more advice on writing style from his vast treasure trove of published and spoken words. His advice, just as his books, is eternal.</p><blockquote>Why should you examine your writing style with the idea of improving it? Do so as a mark of respect for your readers, whatever you’re writing. If you scribble your thoughts any which way, your readers will surely feel that you care nothing about them. They will mark you down as an egomaniac or a chowderhead or, worse, they will stop reading you. The most damning revelation you can make about yourself is that you do not know what is interesting and what is not.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/411239105?app_id=122963\" width=\"426\" height=\"240\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"&amp;ldquo;Singularity (after Stephen Hawking)&amp;rdquo; by Marie Howe\"></iframe></figure><hr><h2 id=\"featured-writermatt-gemmell\">Featured Writer - <a href=\"https://mattgemmell.com/?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">Matt Gemmell</a></h2><p>I have been reading Matt since, back when he used to write mostly about technology. Since then, he has gone on to publish some thrilling novels. Matt has a clear mind and an astute way of putting complex thoughts into words. Besides, he has a long list of some profound essays reflecting on his life and some advice on writing &amp; productivity. Here’s an excerpt from one of his essays where he talks about confidence.</p><blockquote>Confidence is a little trickier to muster when you’re pre-judged due to the incidental fact of being female, or when your viewpoint can be dismissed as down to uncontrolled emotion, or timidity, or hormones. When perceptions of your physical power become an albatross around your neck, and when the default compliment is not about your abilities, but rather your appearance.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"featured-toolhemingway-editor\">Featured Tool - <a href=\"http://www.hemingwayapp.com/?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">Hemingway Editor</a></h2><p>A short, simple app that intends to be “a spellchecker, but for style”. You may decide not to agree with all the suggestions it provides. Nonetheless, it is an extremely valuable editing tool.</p><blockquote>Too often, our words are like our thoughts — innumerable and disorganized. Almost any bit of writing could use some cutting.</blockquote><p>It is always useful to run your prose through someone who can tell you as a reader which parts are unnecessarily difficult to understand.

However, it is always welcome to revisit the abundance of advice that he has left behind as part of his multiple public appearances.</p><blockquote>“I don’t praise plots as accurate representations of life, but as ways to keep readers reading. When I used to teach creative writing, I would tell the students to make their characters want something right away—even if it’s only a glass of water. Characters paralyzed by the meaninglessness of modern life still have to drink water from time to time.”</blockquote><h3 id=\"reflections-on-writing-by-henry-miller-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/11/30/henry-miller-reflections-on-writing/\">Reflections on Writing by Henry Miller</a> →</h3><p>I always find it fascinating to read about what keeps writers motivated to write. What makes them come back to their desks every day and pour all their thoughts and stories out on to a paper. Continuing the theme of the second issue, here’s another brilliant essay from Henry Miller (and its insightful interpretation by <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/\">brainpickings</a>) where he dwells on how creating literature can affect a writer’s life.</p><blockquote>“I do not believe in words, no matter if strung together by the most skillful man: I believe in language, which is something beyond words, something which words give only an adequate illusion of. Words do not exist separately, except in the minds of scholars, etymologists, philologists, etc. Words divorced from language are dead things, and yield no secrets.”</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"featured-writerjennifer-reinfried\">Featured Writer - <a href=\"https://reinfriedbooks.com/\">Jennifer Reinfried</a></h2><p>Very few writers can blend multiple genres while writing fiction.

I just don't need it.</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have been using HEY for almost two weeks now and since last few days, I have hardly acted on any emails the way the team wants me to. Most emails have been filtered out. Tells me an email as a communication medium is already pretty worthless for me.  I can't pay so much for something that's worth so little. Here's my state from yesterday as I <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://micro.blog/amit/9882520\" target=\"_blank\">responded to</a> an ongoing conversation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>HEY makes my email even more worthless than it already is for me. I hardly see any emails getting filtered through to me. I'm yet to decide if it's a good thing or a bad one.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have always been a user of the <em>free</em> Gmail service until now. I have evaluated many email services over the years, but haven't paid for any. I do not run my livelihood over my personal email. Neither do I receive so many emails that managing them becomes a hassle of any sort. I could just sit down for a few minutes and handle all of them together. I hardly have to triage them -- snooze or reply later are all nice features. But I rarely need them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If all the other emails services failed to pique any interest in me earlier, why did HEY even come so close? Well, because I do see how all the features they tout as game-changing can actually solve the problems many people face with their email. No wonder then that even I want to use all the features. But my current lifestyle just doesn't have any need for any of those.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>But the screening and the feed and the paper trail?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, I spent the last couple of hours on Gmail to clean my filters -- and with that, I have now got a pretty similar workflow in place with the help of filters and customized priority inbox. Here's how my inbox looks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":6089,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/f404136a66.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6089\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Will I be able to maintain it? No idea. I have managed to sail through for so long. I had no clue about the sheer amount of emails even my current system was already \"screening\" out. So, I believe I would be fine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Won't I love if a system did that for me? Well, sure I would love that. But you see Hey <em>doesn't</em> want to be that system. Here's <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://hey.com/the-hey-way/\" target=\"_blank\">an excerpt from their manifesto</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Email’s better with a human at the helm. That’s you. You’re better at deciding where things go, what your intentions are, and how you want things set up. The machines have a lot of learning to do before they'll be able to second-guess whether you actually wanted to see that email, whether it was a receipt or a newsletter, and even what you should be writing someone. At HEY, it's human intelligence over artificial intelligence.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The whole workflow in HEY begins with me screening the first time senders before they arrive at my inbox. Well, nice. However, am ok to take the same decision after it has reached my inbox -- I will create a filter. That's ugly, manual work sure. But <em>it doesn't cost me $99/year worth of my time</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have already created labels for feeds and paper trail. And many more. Because you see, my emails don't just fit in these two categories. I have a lot many more filters. And I have pretty simple rules for each.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>I need this mail in my inbox, unread.</li><li>I need this to skip my inbox, but stay unread. I will get to it.</li><li>I need this to skip my inbox and get marked as read.</li><li>I need this to be deleted.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's it. All my filters do just this. I will continue to do so manually. (I do wish though that the Gmail's Android app allowed creating simple filters in their app.)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>And am ok to lose the email address I want?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, I've currently shared my Gmail address everywhere. Even if I shift to HEY, I have to change the email address registered with many of the services. I think if I am ever to go through all this trouble, it would be for one with my custom domain. In which case, it won't matter what email address I get <em>on the service</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All in all, HEY is a brilliant service with a fresh perspective towards the way we use our emails. It can potentially enliven the email offerings from all the players, just the away Gmail did back in 2004. But I don't face the problem it is trying to solve; I have no use for all its groundbreaking features. So, I can in no way justify paying the price it asks for it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

First published: summer 1946. A fascinating look at Orwell’s early life and what made him the writer that he eventually became.</p><blockquote>It is his [<em>a writer’s</em>] job, no doubt, to discipline his temperament and avoid getting stuck at some immature stage, in some perverse mood; but if he escapes from his early influences altogether, he will have killed his impulse to write. Putting aside the need to earn a living, I think there are four great motives for writing, at any rate for writing prose.</blockquote><blockquote>All writers are vain, selfish, and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery. Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. And yet it is also true that one can write nothing readable unless one constantly struggles to efface one’s own personality. Good prose is like a windowpane</blockquote><h3 id=\"on-the-journals-of-famous-writers-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://lithub.com/on-the-journals-of-famous-writers/\">On the Journals of Famous Writers</a> →</h3><p>Dustin Illingworth Eavesdrops on Flannery O'Connor, Susan Sontag, and More. “Few literary artifacts remain as consistently enigmatic as the author’s journal. It seems to me that the more we read of them, the more elusive their provenance”</p><blockquote>Over the past few months, I have lived within the journals of heroes and strangers, compared daily word counts with Virginia Woolf, trembled before Alma Mahler’s social calendar, pitied Kafka’s lovers. I’ve read pages and pages with interest and empathy, with boredom and more than a little shame. But having traversed that stack of lives, what remains more than anything, tingling like a phantom limb, is a sensation of stillness: the journal as the eye of the writing life’s storm.</blockquote><blockquote>“In the journal,” Susan Sontag wrote, “I do not just express myself more openly than I could to any person; I create myself.”</blockquote><h3 id=\"my-lifes-sentencesby-jhumpa-lahiri-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/my-lifes-sentences/\">My Life's Sentences - by Jhumpa Lahiri</a> →</h3><p>Jhumpa Lahiri recounts her relationship with her sentences. A fine way to look at how a story or a novel, what she refers to as forest, is conceived - “one in front of the other”.</p><blockquote>Constructing a sentence is the equivalent of taking a Polaroid snapshot: pressing the button, and watching something emerge. To write one is to document and to develop at the same time. Sentences are the bricks as well as the mortar, the motor as well as the fuel. They are the cells, the individual stitches. Their nature is at once solitary and social.</blockquote><blockquote>Even printed, on pages that are bound, sentences remain unsettled organisms. Years later, I can always reach out to smooth a stray hair. And yet, at a certain point, I must walk away, trusting them to do their work. I am left looking over my shoulder, wondering if I might have structured one more effectively.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oP3c1h8v2ZQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><hr><h2 id=\"featured-writercheri-baker\">Featured Writer - <a href=\"https://cheribaker.com/\">Cheri Baker</a></h2><p>Cheri is an author with a brilliant mind.

You go outside and check for damage, counting broken windows and dangling power lines, wondering how much it’s going to cost to put everything back together again. Only the thing that’s broken isn’t a house or a neighborhood, it’s the entire economy. And without a vaccine ready there are likely to be more storms rolling in.

As I watched Sulley and Mike struggle to keep Boo safe, at the same time growing closer to her, it made me worried and equally excited for the parent that I was one day going to be. I fell in love with Boo as she expressed myriad of expressions through her toddler face.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>7. Inside Out (2015)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This has to be one of the smartest and most creative animated movies ever made. Such a creative story stitched into a brilliant movie. The colours, the characters, their journeys alone and together. How they drove the central human character was fascinating. This was again a movie that made me realize what I need not do around my daughter as she reaches adolescence one day. The story was clever, the execution was top-notch and the emotional attachment was to the point.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>6. Wall-E (2008)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another clever movie from Pixar. The first half without any spoken words was absolutely brilliant. I still can’t fathom how the studio made us fall in love with a squarish droid. He doesn’t speak, he doesn’t have any human features. But he expressed so many emotions that many of the well-paid actors fail to do. Wall-E’s struggle to express his love for Eve had me root for this lovely droid throughout the movie. Wish humans didn’t arrive later in the movie to spoil what could have been the finest movie of all times.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><b>5. Toy Story (1995)</b></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another movie that I watched way back in my teens when I had started to believe I had become too grown up to watch animated movies any more. Pixar prove me wrong — boy what a masterpiece this one is. A movie with a brilliant story that also teaches you so much. Still being so much fun at the same time. Toy Story completely defined the roadmap for future animated films — they had to cater to the kids and the adults with a kid within at the same time. This movie did it so perfectly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><b>4. Coco (2017)</b></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I love music. And I love getting emotional while watching a movie. Especially if it weaves stories around families. So Coco fit just the right spots for me. Boy, oh boy. Such a wonderful ride it was. Those mesmerizing colours. The peppy, moving music. The story that has you gripped throughout. Coco was an experience of a kind. Again, such a meaningful movie that teaches you the importance of a family. I had a tear rolling down my cheek during the final reunion song.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><b>3. Finding Nemo (2003)</b></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another film that touched my yet-to-be-a-parent’s heart. I was rooting for the worried, clown-fish dad throughout his transformation. And I can’t recall how many more times have I rooted for this guy since then. I watch this movie every now and then with my daughter. She loves it; she asks me many questions about what plays out in the movie. I pull her close to me into a hug and answer her to the best of my abilities. Knowing very well, that soon she too would want to explore more and I would have to stop being overprotective and let her do that. Anyway, see that’s what even thinking about this movie does to me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>2. Toy Story 3 (2010)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s just so much to love about this movie. The friendship, the bond that we’ve seen grow over the 3 movies, comes so close to a culmination here. Full of laughter. Full of life-lessons. Full of heartbreaks. This is one hell of a movie - not just an animated one. Period. As Woody looks at Andy walking away while sitting close to Bonny towards the end, am sobbing away with joy. There are so many plots here and each one betters the last. This one is a string of masterclass at film making, one after another.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>1. Up (2009)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just with that masterful opening montage, this one enters my top ten list any day. I had a lump in my throat right at the beginning. The movie follows it up with weaving such a beautiful story about Carl and his relation with Russel and the many friends he makes over their journey to Paradise Falls. I loved each character in this movie. Russel. Kevin. Dug. Even Muntz for that matter. The movie had me empathize with this antagonist too before he goes all bat-shit crazy, that is. And of course, finally Carl. I loved Carl so much that I had one character based on him in my fictional short story series. Up will always remain a very special movie for me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Best Moments from other movies</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are of course many other movies from Pixar that didn’t make the list but have some brilliant scenes. When She Loved Me song from <b>Toy Story 2</b>. All the action sequence from <b>The Incredibles</b>. Speech on criticism and creativity in the finale from <b>Ratatouille</b>. These movies could very well have made the list, just for these scenes. But, for me, the others on the list are just very close. So these remain the honourable mentions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<p>The Mystery of the Blue Train is a typical Poirot mystery, just not presented in her signature intriguing style. There are just too many shifts to the points of view of the supporting characters. The clues are perceivable, but they aren&#x2019;t backed by any information that is revealed earlier. There were many moments when I knew what was being narrated was important, was a clue to something. But I could just not put my finger on why that was so. The resolution towards the end too did not feel very natural; it felt rushed, forced.</p> <p>With the way the novel is structured, it felt as if Christie began writing this somewhere in the middle when Poirot is introduced, reached towards the end, and began to wonder how to tie the woven mystery up. All the side characters and their backstories were penned at that point and spread across the novel.</p> <p>As a whole, the story just didn&#x2019;t feel coherent. It wasn&#x2019;t boring; I don&#x2019;t think Christie can write a boring mystery. But it just wasn&#x2019;t one of her finest works. I have heard even she has acknowledged this fact.</p>\n",

I was left completely clueless on how to respond to that.</p> <p>My daughter&#x2019;s school has enabled schooling of 5 subjects via an app. Each week, the app presents a new set of chapters, worksheets, quizzes across all 5 subjects. Besides, each week there are video conference sessions with teachers to recap what was learned in the last week.</p> <p>Sorry to report, but just two weeks in, this process already seems overwhelming. It is especially so given both me and my wife are working from home.</p> <p>I knew we weren&#x2019;t alone. <span class=\"small-caps\">AP</span> <a href=\"https://apnews.com/a3e86445d1387ecd8d1df8f9f7743e1f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">published a brilliant article</a> on how parents in the <span class=\"small-caps\">US</span> are already getting burned through this distance learning&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;something that is especially tricky with young kids. And they are forced to make a very difficult choice.</p> <blockquote> <p>Amid the barrage of learning apps, video meet-ups and e-mailed assignments that pass as pandemic home school, some frustrated and exhausted parents are choosing to disconnect entirely for the rest of the academic year. Others are cramming all their children&#x2019;s school work into the weekend or taking days off work to help their kids with a week&#x2019;s worth of assignments in one day.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is just not easy. Parents aren&#x2019;t trained to be good teachers. The technology was never given a chance to prove it can work independently for teaching. It was always an additive. Plus nothing, <em>nothing</em> can replace the in-person learning from the people who are trained throughout their lives to do that. The comment below from one of the parents is very, very apt.</p> <blockquote> <p>This is a very crude bandage we&#x2019;re putting on a very big wound. We&#x2019;re just doing the best we can. A video can&#x2019;t look at your child&#x2019;s face and see the confusion. A teacher can do that.</p> </blockquote>\n",

It presented a list of questions that one should lead with while talking to others<strong>. </strong></p> <p>I thought I will try and attempt to answer a few of these myself. Maybe you can give it a try too. And if you do, I would like to read how you are dealing with this challenging moment. Here&#x2019;s my attempt.</p> <note> <strong>How are you taking care of yourself today?</strong> </note> <p>Listening to music&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;spending some time with <em>myself</em>. It&#x2019;s been some time that I did that. I used to do that very often. Of course, it was a lot easier to find some lone time. Not that easy any more.</p> <note> <strong>What part of your shelter-in-place residence have you come to appreciate the most?</strong> </note> <p>The corner with my study table, I am happy that I spent some significant time designing it while I was renovating my home. And another room I like to go relax in now and then is the bathroom.</p> <note> <strong>What surprising thing have you been stocking up on (that isn&#x2019;t toilet paper)?</strong> </note> <p>Body lotion&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;I do not know why, but I have got many of them now. And biscuits. I never knew I liked biscuits so much.</p> <note> <strong>What&#x2019;s a story&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;from a book, a movie, an article, a conversation&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;that you&#x2019;ve been gripped by recently? Why did it capture you?</strong> </note> <p>All the stories of sacrifices that get published every single day&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;when the humans have behaved just the way they should. It has been rare to read about recently.</p> <note> <strong>What habit have you started, or broken, during the quarantine?</strong> </note> <p>I have fallen out of the habit of writing the morning pages. I know I shouldn&#x2019;t have. But for some reason, there isn&#x2019;t much that&#x2019;s different that every new day dawns with.</p> <p>I have fallen into my old habit of listening to the music&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;lots of varied music.</p> <p>I am not listening to podcasts. Or Audiobooks. I am <em>reading</em> lots of books.</p> <note> <strong>Which specific place in your neighborhood are you most looking forward to visiting once this is all over?</strong> </note> <p>Every part of the neighborhood. Everything that&#x2019;s outside. That&#x2019;s crowded. The streets. The restaurants.</p> <note> <strong>What&#x2019;s the easiest part about the quarantine?</strong> </note> <p>Finding stuff to idle the time away with.</p> <note> <strong>What are some things you have realized that you don&#x2019;t really need?</strong> </note> <p>Air conditioners. Cash.</p> <note> <strong>What&#x2019;s something you own that feels useful?</strong> </note> <p>Internet. Kindle. Plants and Garden.</p> <note> <strong>What is your COVID-19 nickname/alter-ego?</strong> </note> <p>The chatty, social one. I have been part of many zoom meetings, few even those where I knew no one on the other side.</p> <note> <strong>What problem&#x2014;either yours, or something more global &#x2014;do you wish you could solve?</strong> </note> <p>Illiteracy. Stupidity. Rebelism.</p>\n",

The idea started simple - what if there was a simple posting interface for <a href=\"https://blot.im/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blot</a>? In extension, something that one can use to write and publish a post to Dropbox. Blot is simple as-is for writing and posting (<em>it&#x2019;s all files</em>). But there are times when I do want to quickly post from my web browser. And for such times, I still need a simple writing interface.</p> <p>That thought was enough to interest both me and David. We got to work. The project got neglected in between. And then was picked up again. And I think, it is in a state now where it can really be useful to a few. I can attest to that because I, myself, have been using it for <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/1585247849573\">few days now</a>.</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://wall.blot.im/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wall</a>&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;a<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>web-accessible text-editor over Dropbox, <em>works nicely with Blot</em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span>.</p> <p>I believe this would be useful for many. It is <em>clean</em>. It is <em>light, pure-client side</em> application. It supports <strong>local drafts</strong>. It can <strong>export markdown</strong>. It can <strong>publish to Blot</strong>. Perfect for all those text posts.</p> <p>I have <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/scribe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my own fork</a> of the project where I want to use the editor and support publishing to multiple places. To start with, I have extended it to post it anywhere in Dropbox.</p> <p>I have hosted it <a href=\"https://scribe.itchs.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here as Scribe</a>. I plan to extend it next to be used as a micropub client. Still in works, though.</p> <p>Of course, this is not perfect yet. For one, it does not work well on smaller screens.

There are already reports of how this is affecting families all around the world. I am afraid the chances are people will soon get fed-up, get impatient. They might stop caring about others, become isolated within. Become indifferent.</p> <p>Of course, another possibility is that this will bring immediate families even closer. I can do all that I do in a group while I am at home with family. I can decide not to isolate myself at home. I get focused hours for work and at the same time decide not to stay glued to the laptop throughout the day while working. Take the breaks that I usually take and spend that time with my family.</p> <p>There is no need to wind the working day down with media consumption as I can relieve stress throughout the day when required. Look beyond the mobile, tablet and television screens. I can spend the hours I generally wasted on commutes on something productive.</p> <p>Share stories. Hear from loved ones. Play with my daughter. Talk, chat, discuss, debate, tease. Laugh. Do everything I do at the office. And more.</p> <p>I think I will give this possibility a chance. Distance, not isolate. May be, social distancing, physically distancing myself from the outside world, will bring me emotionally closer to my family.</p>\n",

All the posts exist on the home page of the root domain now and is hosted by Blot. There are no sub-domains for separate posts. There is no landing page. It’s all words.</p> <p>Of course, I had butterflies in my stomach before I began the whole exercise. I had posts spread across different categories. I had very specific styling done for some rarely used components of the blog posts. And I had pages.</p> <p>Then I had some complex pages and posts. It was the thought of migrating this varied content that made me a bit edgy. Posts like this guide on <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/moving-from-squarespace-to-hugo\">moving to Hugo</a>. Or this one about <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/display-webmentions/\">displaying webmentions</a> along with posts. I had to manually migrate such posts along with the necessary styles.</p> <p>I am happy overall with what I have achieved. Things are simpler now. If I have to post something, I know where it would be. Doesn’t matter what the nature of the post is. This space now supports all types. Along with the <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/now\"><code>/now</code></a> page reseted to begin from <em>now</em>.</p> <p>What this also means that I have to bear with few things. I have lost webmentions to the <code>blog</code> sub-domain posts. I have to reset my indieweb presence, clear all caches with indieauth sites. Thankfully, not much was broken that couldn’t be fixed simple re-logins and re-configurations. I (and <em>you</em>) have to bear with the configured redirects to propagate through the Internet and reach all. So the old links will stay unreachable till that happens.</p> <p>I have kept the Hugo site alive. It hosts <a href=\"https://archive.amitgawande.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the archive</a>, something I did not want to carry along. I just restyled it to make it resemble a timeline leading back into the time. I do not wish to ever post to it again.

I enjoyed this book, almost most of it. However it is, by no means, a great book.</p> <p>The story is too formulaic. The mystery is predictable. Most of the characters are not built well. Every plot<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>twist&#x201D; can be seen chapters ahead. Even the narration is too simplistic. It is linear with the problems introduced in a chapter and solved right in the next one. There is simply no tension.</p> <p>However, the overall book is a breezy read. No part gets boring. I especially liked the parts where it was just about Scott and Maggie, the German Shepherd. I usually do not enjoy the subplots involving pets. They are overdone most often, made too dramatic. That&#x2019;s not the case here. The bonding between them is developed really well. You care for both. And that&#x2019;s where lies the strength of the novel. I just wish it was backed by a nice crime mystery.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>The decade gone by - 2010-2019 - was the most important decade of my life.</p> <p>This was the first full decade that I lived an <em>independent</em> life away from my parents - shaping my own life in a way. My personal life. And my professional life. I spent the decade before this one completing my education, setting things up for my life to come. But it was in this decade when I started recognizing myself. Defining myself.</p> <p>I got settled into my first job. I fell in love and then married her. We moved in into a house and made it our home. We learned to live together. We purchased our first car. We decided to settle in and shifted to a new town to do just that. We found a house where we felt we could start our independent life together and purchased it.</p> <p>We decided the time was right to welcome another member to our family. We were blessed with a baby girl, our little angel, and I fell in love again. She became our life. For the next years to come, every decision we took, <em>I</em> took was to make sure our daughter has the best life.</p> <p>I grew professionally. I proved my worth and gained respect amongst colleagues. And when that started dwindling towards the end of the decade, I decided it was time to move on to a new job. By this time, I was pretty clear what I wanted out of my carrier and thankfully I found a place and a role that could provide me with that.</p> <p>I identified my interests outside of work. And they have managed to provide me with the stability, the sanity in my lone times.</p> <p>As I look back at the years gone by, I can&#x2019;t help but think this was indeed <em>the</em> most important decade of my life.</p> <p>If there was one common theme that defined this decade for me was the decisions, the life-altering decisions I had to make throughout the past 10 years. The decisions that would make or break my life.</p> <p>And I think I have managed to come out unscathed. Bruised, scraped now and then, sure. But not marred. I feel satisfied with that.</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s me <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/10-year-challenge\">looking inwards</a> at the start of the year on how the past 10 years have affected me.</p> <blockquote> <p>the fidgety teen from 10 years back has given way to the calmer, saner, thoughtful self of today. I feel content within and that is the most important thing.</p> </blockquote> <p>No doubt, today&#x2019;s is a changed, improved me over 10-years-younger myself. But if the decade gone by was defined by the <em>decisions</em>, I believe it would be the <em>balance</em> that defines the next decade - a balance between change and stability. Exciting times!</p>\n",

The above steps have helped me not stay glued to the app for hours. I either access the video directly (if I know what I want to watch) or browse my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Subscriptions page</a> (when I don&#x2019;t know what to watch). The home page is useless without history turned on. And so are other recommendations. Trust me, you do not want them.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I am on a journey <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/tagged/minimalism\">to consciously reclaim focus</a> from the shambles of the distracting digital world. As part of the process, I have started actively following one more routine - I log out of every social media service once I have used it.</p> <p>I have, since long, not had any social media apps on my mobile device. This has helped me reduce the subconscious pick-ups of the device. At the same time, it was really easy to access the service in a browser. Especially because it is just one tap away in my favourites. That&#x2019;s as good as having an app on my device.</p> <p>To deter these, I now log out of every service from my browser once I have used it. So, every time I am tempted to access any of these services, an additional step of logging in is needed. There&#x2019;s also an added barrier of two-factor authentications for the services that support it. Cal Newport <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">aptly captures</a> this sentiment of mine.</p> <blockquote> <p>By removing your ability to access social media at any moment, you reduce its ability to become a crutch deployed to distract you from bigger voids in your life.</p> </blockquote> <p>All and all, this one step alone of logging in every time is enough to fool my lazy mind to stay away from these<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>crutches&#x201D;. And hence not subconsciously spend any time on the services.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> I have already gotten rid of every social media platform I do not need (Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat). I am active only on Twitter and Micro.blog. To reiterate, my logout routine is applicable to every site that serves feed of some kind. Including email, feed readers, instant messaging platforms etc.</p> <p>Besides, I have started accessing these social services only at my desktop browser in Private mode (the Incognito mode in Firefox). So even if I forget to logout, it does not matter. Once the window is closed, all my session information is lost.</p> <p>I believe this change should also help me from a privacy perspective. The belief is the cookies from these data-hungry social media services would not follow me as I browse around the Internet.</p> <p>Can&#x2019;t they? Won&#x2019;t they? That&#x2019;s a whole different discussion. But overall am spending a lot less time absentmindedly scrolling these stupid feeds. I feel a lot less burdened thanks to that.</p>\n",

Whitehat hackers at Germany&#x2019;s Security Research Labs developed eight apps&#x2014;four Alexa<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>skills&#x201D; and four Google Home<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>actions&#x201D;&#x2014;that all passed Amazon or Google security-vetting processes. The skills or actions posed as simple apps for checking horoscopes, with the exception of one, which masqueraded as a random-number generator. Behind the scenes, these<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>smart spies,&#x201D; as the researchers call them, surreptitiously eavesdropped on users and phished for their passwords.</p> </blockquote> <p>These horror stories of privacy violations on smart speakers are unending. There are just a few options here.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>Don&#x2019;t have anything, that has a mic or camera and is connected to the internet, around you.</li> <li>If that&#x2019;s too much for you, don&#x2019;t have any smart speakers in your home. Use your smartphone to connect to a good old Bluetooth speaker.</li> <li>If you do want a smart speaker around, learn you to use it cautiously. Switch it off when not needed. Use the mute option. Do not, <em>do not</em> install any third-party skill on the device. Let only Google and Amazon track you. At the very least, they can be held accountable.</li> </ol>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>It was exactly a year ago that I had posted an update on my then-recently undertaken <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/on-podcasts-news-well-being#no-news-experiment\">no-news experiment</a>. It primarily involved -</p> <ul> <li>consuming news only through the morning newspaper</li> <li>no news related apps on my phone</li> <li>no notifications from social apps (including messages, WhatsApp)</li> </ul> <p>I am pleasantly surprised that the things begun then have more or less stayed the same. I still consume my news primarily from the morning newspaper. I still avoid visiting the news website. I still have the notifications from social apps disabled. For that matter, I have become more aggressive in disabling notification access to any app.</p> <p>The only deviation has been that I have installed a few news apps on my phone. I always had that urge to open some editorial on the browser when my mind was momentarily free. This minor change has quenched that.</p> <p>Of course, I am still extremely picky about which apps get installed. I have installed only a couple of news curating apps (also known for doing their job well). And The New York Times app.</p> <h1 id=\"digital-detox---no-youtube\">Digital Detox - No YouTube</h1> <p>I have also recently undertaken a digital detox experiment. I want to check which additional service I can get off my routine. It should be something that I carelessly spend a lot of time on.</p> <p>I had recently been consuming a lot of stupid content on YouTube. I used to open the app every time I had some free time at hand. Or for that matter <em>even when I was busy</em> doing something else. It garnered a subconscious tap. Such absent-minded behaviour is never healthy.</p> <p>So I have planned to be off YouTube for at least a month to reset the terms of my relationship with this service. It has been 15 days now and I already feel better. I no longer have that urge to tap into YouTube any more. I have observed am following my routine a lot better.</p> <p>However, YouTube has become too important a destination for all kinds of videos. That includes videos relevant to my work too. So it is difficult to completely get rid of the access to the service.</p> <p>Of course, then, I plan to allow access to the app in a controlled manner. This time, however, I will set the terms again consciously. I am also planning to clear the YouTube view history before I do that. I believe this will help me reset the recommendations. I am, however, yet to decide the exact terms under which the service will be allowed back.</p> <p>During this month of digital detox, I also plan to indulge myself with some analogue activities that I had never done before. I have started doodling more. Sure, am not good at it. But I hit the web for inspiration and try to simply emulate.</p> <p>I am also spending dedicated time with my daughter without any digital devices around. It can be as less as 15 minutes. Involving simple talks. Or some silly games. But it has to be focused time.</p> <p>It is too early to see the effects of all this. One thing is for sure, though. I feel a tad less burdened on the inside.</p>\n",

Or he enjoys doing manually. According to Derek, the decision of whether one wants automation or not comes down to is this.</p> <blockquote> <p>how much of an expert you are at controlling this thing yourself, how much you still enjoy doing it, if you want the kind of assistance it provides</p> </blockquote> <p>I believe there is one more aspect that drives this decision for me - how convenient will the automation make my life after all? And what is the the cost associated with automating that?</p> <p>The price one pays might be in terms of the personal data he or she needs to relinquish. This is relevant primarily when the automation workflows are built and served ready-made by the companies. For example, as part of various functions of the smart assistants.</p> <p>It can also be in terms of the actual time one has to put in to build the overall automation workflow. This comes into picture when you are linking multiple applications and services to get a use-case handled. For example, while using Shortcuts or <span class=\"small-caps\">IFTT</span>, Zapier and likes.</p> <p>In both the cases, whether I want the automation or not is a trade-off between the efficiency I gain due to the automation and the price I have to pay for that.</p>\n",

Right about that time, I heard a voice in Hindi, a local Indian language, giving directions to my Uber driver. It made me pause and ponder on how ubiquitous the technical solutions have become. A large section of society has learnt to start carrying these powerful devices along. And this change alone has made some complex businesses more accessible.</p> <p>Many, especially Apple, mock Android for being<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>a cesspool of cheap, sluggish devices&#x201D;.

I decided to look around to the individuals, running small and medium businesses, using digital solutions.

And they continue to lessen the needs of the platform, recently with the introduction of the <a href=\"https://www.android.com/versions/go-edition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Go edition</a>.

And while we do that, let&#x2019;s also make the same affordable technology powerful.

				"content_text": "<p>I recently went through an experience that put my rational mind under a scanner. After a tiring session of shopping for clothes, I stood in the queue to pay for the stuff that my family had <em>finally</em> decided to buy. I always hate the process of selecting clothes in the shopping malls - more so when my family&#x2019;s doing it than me. I just can&#x2019;t fathom the sheer number of parameters my wife, my daughter and my sister together can cobble up while deciding a piece of cloth to be selected (to be frank, rejected seems to be more apt). Anyway, it is a battle that I have lost many occasions over years - so moving on.</p> <p>The billing process that follows isn&#x2019;t painless either. I am always bombarded with so many questions.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Do you have membership? Why not? There are no many benefits like blah.. blah.. Why won&#x2019;t you become a member?&#x201D;<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Which card do you have? Why don&#x2019;t you pay this way rather than that?&#x201D;<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Would you need a shopping bag? 1 Large? Or 2 medium?&#x201D;</p> <p>It&#x2019;s an unending sequence of dreadful moments till I leave the shopping mall. But this time it ended in slightly different manner. I was offered an offer which am convinced now must have been part of some psychological study. The lady behind the billing counter explained it to me somewhat like this (emphasis her and mine).</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Sir, you made a purchase worth a specific, <em>nontrivial</em> amount, so you <em>stand a chance</em> to win an assured gift. This is <em>not</em> a lucky draw, you will win some gift<a href=\"#footnote-1FNX\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-1FNX\"><sup>1</sup></a> for sure. All you have to do is pay a <em>significant</em> amount. That will make you eligible (<em>wasn&#x2019;t I already?</em>) for this assured gift. And the cost of the cheapest assured gift is twice as higher than the price you pay (<em>how can I verify</em>). So, of course, I should include that, right?&#x201D;</p> <p>So, in short, it is pay (over and above what you have already paid for the shopping) to win assuredly? Like what you would do in a casino - but with some surety angle? Why not just have an aisle full of assured gift cards? Why link it to billing? I couldn&#x2019;t help but think it had to do with the fact that my abilities to think rationally are depleted due to the exhaustion from the decisions made earlier during shopping. And my mind is at my most vulnerable state.</p> <p>With the pressure from the people queued behind me growing, I nervously said yes. But within seconds, pushed by the pressure from my rational mind, I said no. I wasn&#x2019;t ready to undergo the scrutiny of my thoughts.</p> <section class=\"footnotes\"> <hr /> <ol> <li id=\"footnote-1FNX\"><p>The gifts included bedrolls, luggages, some <span class=\"small-caps\">OLED</span> television set, bikes and even car.<a href=\"#ref-1FNX\" class=\"footnote-back\">&#x21A9;</a></p></li> </ol> </section>\n",

On mobile, I am terrible. I just can&#x2019;t make sense of the direction or speed. And completely pathetic in multiplayer situations.</p> <p>Same applies to the racing games. It was ok till it was simple <em>lane following</em> games, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Fighter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Road Fighter</a>. But then they become a lot more real.</p> <p>Actually, the quest to be more real with the gameplay and the graphics killed this form of media for me. It made the controls a lot more convoluted to be fun any more. Arcade-type games had some breezy liveliness to them. But gradually, gaming became a lot more serious, a lot more pro for my casual taste. These pros ruined the arcade in a way.</p> <p>Of course, that doesn&#x2019;t mean there do not exist casual games. There do. However, most of them are ruined by the freemium model. And I am not the first one complaining about this.</p> <p>But what that meant was even the casual gamer in me had recently died&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;pushed way back for the fear of the effort it would take to find that one good, clean casual game.

I am especially pleased with Apple&#x2019;s aggressive pricing and push in the non-US markets and the initial reviews of the games. These sound like the games that match my taste.</p> <p>I hope these stay the way they are currently. I hope the pros do not ruin the Arcade again.</p>\n",

It hosts <a href=\"https://snoozyrealm.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my old blog</a> with posts from ages ago&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;it currently acts as an archive of the un-migrated posts for me.</p> <p>There is a reason why I am a bit itchy with my writing workflow. I am struggling to get stuff written across systems, mainly mobile and desktops, at home and work, with drafts kept in sync. Sure, I can use Dropbox as my file store and access the draft posts using iA Writer or other Markdown text editors. However, I am very particular with not signing into and linking anything personal on my work machine, so this workflow does not work at work.</p> <p>I would have really liked something that is web based. I have been, since long, trying to find <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/1561697966995\">a micropub client</a> with a satisfying writing experience for long form posts, along with drafts support. I still haven&#x2019;t found one. Neither have my attempts to just create one ground up gone anywhere, mainly for the need for multiple working drafts.</p> <p>I do have a Netlify <span class=\"small-caps\">CMS</span> setup for my <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/\">main Hugo driven website</a>. However, though it works fine from a desktop, it has a terrible experience on mobile.</p> <p>Wordpress solves this particular problem for me. I have come to realize <em>finally</em> that it has a nice, clean writing interface on desktop. And with its stable mobile app, the workflow is manageable on mobile too.</p> <p>But, boy I am ruined by markdown - I can&#x2019;t write in<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Rich Text&#x201D; any more. Plus, I can&#x2019;t host my posts on a website which does not have the Indieweb principles baked in. I am aware that Wordpress has a IndieWeb plugin. However, one needs a business account to install plugins. And that&#x2019;s too much of a cost to sign up for this casual experiment.</p> <p>So my search for the online writing interface with support for sync and drafts and satisfactory interface on desktop and mobile continues. With Wordpress, it&#x2019;s so close, but far.</p>\n",

They all make these dull devices a lot more fun. And their fun factor is what makes them sell in masses.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I wonder what the purists think of the recent computational photography trend.</p> <p>Google started it with its all-in-cloud touch up of the photos. And then they moved it on-device in the camera app. Every photo one took was stitched together from multiple shots with different settings. And eventually each <span class=\"small-caps\">OEM</span> made their cameras smarter,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>AI-driven&#x201D;.</p> <p>Latest iPhone 11 stitches a single photo from 4 under exposed frames taken before the shutter button is clicked, one normal picture and 1 over exposed frame. They call this process semantic rendering. What follows is some heavy processing. Here&#x2019;s snippet from the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868727/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review-camera-battery-life-screen-midnight-green-price\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Verge&#x2019;s review</a> of iPhone 11 Pro review.</p> <blockquote> <p>Smart <span class=\"small-caps\">HDR</span> looks for things in the photos it understands: the sky, faces, hair, facial hair, things like that. Then it uses the additional detail from the underexposed and overexposed frames to selectively process those areas of the image: hair gets sharpened, the sky gets de-noised but not sharpened, faces get relighted to make them look more even, and facial hair gets sharpened up. Smart <span class=\"small-caps\">HDR</span> is also now less aggressive with highlights and shadows. Highlights on faces aren&#x2019;t corrected as aggressively as before because those highlights make photos look more natural, but other highlights and shadows are corrected to regain detail.</p> </blockquote> <p>What you get as a result is an extremely clear picture with each object in the photo appropriately visible.</p> <p>But with so much processing of each image, should this even be called photography any more? Here&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia introducing</a> the term.</p> <blockquote> <p>Photography is the art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.</p> </blockquote> <p>What we do with our smartphones is neither an art nor is it creating a single image.</p> <p>All parts of the photos are independently captured (and even pre-captured) with the best suited settings, processed post-capture, with even some <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207310\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">live</a> sections including audio recorded. This is not<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>creating an image&#x201D; any more.</p> <p>Someone might say it all started when the digital photography became mainstream - when the physical limitations of the analog methods did not constrain the person with a camera in his hand. However, what we capture is no longer a single image anymore. A more apt term for these might be<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>visual memories&#x201D;. Common people are interested in doing just that, they don&#x2019;t care if they are called photographers.</p> <p>Let Photography stay an art.</p>\n",

Either I do not have a piece of paper handy or I can&#x2019;t stop and capture the thought (being in middle of traffic, let&#x2019;s say) right at that moment.</p> <p>I am waiting for the day the digital assistants would be smarter to help capture such thought. Today they aren&#x2019;t.

They need structured inputs, which quick notes aren&#x2019;t. Using digital assistants today is a painful battle between reality and expectations.

There is a chance that it can lead to utter chaos when you don&#x2019;t have your device on you. It can completely paralyze you for thoughts.</p>\n",

So, the call for regulating the usage of the data isn&#x2019;t unjustified.

Equally, we regulate financial services, but mortgages, credit cards, the stock market and retail banks&#x2019; capital requirements are all handled very separately. A law that tries to regulate using your face to unlock your phone, or turn yourself into a kitten, and also a system for spotting loyalty-card holders in a supermarket, and to determine where the police can use cameras and how they can store data, is unlikely to be very effective.</p> </blockquote>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Recently, my reading habits have been pleasantly satisfying. If not something that I can be proud of, or anything that&#x2019;s comparable to the voracious readers I know of, at least I am glad they are far improved. It is only the start of September and I have already met <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/8863-2019-reading-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my Goodreads challenge</a>- 4 books ahead of schedule. I understand it was a small target this time - book a month - but I was worried I would not meet even that. I am happy that I did it so comfortably.</p> <p>It is the use of Audible that has led me to at least stay on track for the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>book a month&#x201D; target. Every credit I got in the month was excitedly utilized. I say<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>excitedly&#x201D; because I used to be keen to get a new credit and identify a new book at the start of every month. Of course, it meant I had to change the habits of my<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>reading&#x201D; - rather listening. <em>No podcasts. No music in car.</em> It had to be a book.</p> <p>I thought I would always have one. This month proved that would not be the case always. I was through with the audiobook&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;the brilliant <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34506.The_Light_Fantastic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">second in the Discworld series</a> from Terry Pratchett&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;in the first week itself. Audible is wonderful!</p> <p>This allowed me time to kindle my <em>reading</em> habit next. So, well, my old Kindle had to get recharged and be ready to serve. And serve it did. It was great to complete reading one book and get in the middle of another&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;right after finishing the audible book. There are times when I can&#x2019;t listen&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;or may be I can avoid listening. Especially when I have a limited time at hand. For example while standing in a short queue. Kindle app on my phone has taken that mind space. It is better than letting the stream of some social network, mainly Twitter or YouTube, pollute my mind with some useless posts.</p> <p>So August was brilliant from reading perspective for me - 2.5 books read. I want to continue doing so in the remaining year too.</p> <hr /> <p>There is one book that I just can&#x2019;t get back to, the latest in the Cormoron Strike from J.K.Rowling. This one has stayed there in the list of my<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>currently reading&#x201D; books for more than a year now. I am ~30% in. And I am no way inclined to pick it up again. It is not that I do not enjoy the Strike series. I do. I have throughly enjoyed the first three books. But there is something about the latest one, or the time when I am reading it and the state of my mind, that makes me uninterested in story it narrates. Or the way it narrates it.</p> <p>I may have to drop it for now, move it to couldn&#x2019;t complete. May I will attempt to read it again with a fresh perspective. And at a new phase.</p>\n",

It may, at times, involve sailing through the tirade that the angry, unsatisfied customer unleashes on them. They wait for the right moment to pacify them with a solution that does actually solve the problem that she has.</p> <p>Then there is another section that neither calms a customer down nor solve her problem.

They do not listen to your tirade - they even engage, if necessary. They make you realize that your anger is unjustified at the moment, at the place and is against a person that does not deserve to be shouted at. They pacify you by not making you tired, but by <em>tersely</em> moving on to the actual problem that should be addressed. It demands a degree of confidence in one&#x2019;s knowledge and experience and belief in understanding the customer need better to belong in this group.</p> <p>Which section fits the standard schooling of customer care, is more effective in addressing the customer needs is undoubtedly debatable. I believe majority of the people may prefer the patience and calmness of the first group. But at times, it is the concise interaction of the final group that is beneficial for all parties involved.</p>\n",

				"title": "A Month of Bullet Journaling",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>It&#x2019;s been around a month since <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/1564027700657\">I started</a> maintaining a bullet journal (BuJo, as it is called <em>with love</em>). It has been an enlightening month - I have learned so much about my habits and the way my mind works.</p> <p>Of course, this wasn&#x2019;t my first attempt at maintaining a journal or of planning myself, my life through an organizer. There have been many <em>failed</em> new year resolutions that have led to me buying, keeping and planning my days and months in the traditional journals - ones with days, months written on every page. With every day that I had failed to make an entry in, I had lost my interest in writing or planning another today. I just wasn&#x2019;t organized enough each day, everyday to keep myself, well, organized.</p> <p>However, I love, <em>love</em> updating my <em>personal</em> bullet journal daily. I believe the analog method of doing so is one big reason behind the change. Thoughts flow freely through the pen on to the paper&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;a lot more so than they do digitally. There is something about the legibility (illegibility, to be fair) of the <strong>handwritten words</strong> that lowers some mental hurdles. I always wondered, and even subconsciously ridiculed, the fascination a section of my social circle had with the pen and paper - <a href=\"https://www.penaddict.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the pen addicts</a>. But I do fathom the allure now.</p> <p>The fact that I could be more organized with BuJo by being less organized at times was neat. The process of<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>maintaining&#x201D; a journal feels a lot less formal and this casualness has done wonders for my journaling/organizing attempts. The whole concept of <strong>rapid logging</strong> - capturing thoughts as bulleted lists - worked brilliantly for me. It was ok to miss bullets for a day. It was ok to not have any tasks, but only notes for a day. It was ok to not complete tasks on the day, or even in the week that it was written&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;just migrate it to a new page. It&#x2019;s perfect for my moody, erratic, unorganized mind.</p> <p>A month of <strong>habit tracking</strong> has also been delightful. This is what I was tracking when <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/1565083636179\">I started this habit of tracking habits</a> - morning walk/run, publish 100 words every day, measure weight, three meals a day and regular sleep routine.</p> <p><img src=\"http://blog.amitgawande.com/_img/bujo-habit-tracker.jpeg\" alt=\"Bullet Journal Habit Tracking\"></p> <p>And boy, have I learned stuff about what makes me carry through any habits. Some habits are easy, some are way too difficult.</p> <ul> <li>Habits that I thought would be a cakewalk to follow, turned out to be a walk in a desert. Those I thought would need more push from my side came just naturally.</li> <li>I had thought 100 words to be published daily would be the most difficult task for me to stick to. Three meals/morning walks would be difficult, but not so much. Nah ah. It is apparently easier for me to do things I enjoy doing (<em>bruh, of course</em>) - so I wrote daily more often than I jogged or controlled eating. However, I thoroughly enjoyed attempting to stick to all the three daily, so I plan to continue to track them.</li> <li>Measuring one&#x2019;s weight daily does nothing but act as a deterrent when you are trying to lose your weight. It is easier to do, but useless. Anything that I <em>shouldn&#x2019;t be</em> doing daily doesn&#x2019;t need to be on the tracker.</li> <li>Maintaining regular sleep routine was something I did almost daily. But this tracking was also the most ineffective of the lot. I think I know the reason - I just wasn&#x2019;t specific enough with my target.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Regular&#x201D; and<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>routine&#x201D; are subjective. So any sleep more than 7 hours was fine&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;didn&#x2019;t matter if it was pleasant or how I felt when I woke up. I do want to sign myself up for a good sleep routine. So this particular item would need some changes.</li> </ul> <p>With all the learnings, I decided to continue with my habit tracker, with some tweaking. This is what I would track as my daily habits for the next month.</p> <ul> <li>Rise by 6 <span class=\"small-caps\">AM</span></li> <li>Morning Walk/Run</li> <li>Morning Pages</li> <li>Publish 100 Words</li> <li>3 Meals/day</li> <li>Sleep by 11 <span class=\"small-caps\">PM</span></li> </ul> <p>Since I started maintaining a bullet journal, I have also started carrying along a small diary that I mainly use for the <strong>morning pages</strong>. It helps me declutter my mind to a limit. Do I see benefits? I believe it is too early to say. But it is something I do want to carry on.</p> <p><img src=\"http://blog.amitgawande.com/_img/bujo-aug.jpeg\" alt=\"Bullet Journal\"></p> <p>It has been a wonderful month of reorganizing the way I lead my life with journals. Is it worth all the effort I have to go through? Only time will tell. But it for sure has made some aspects of my life more fun.</p>\n",

You want to read, watch, listen to, learn, earn? <em>There&#x2019;s an app for that.</em></p> <p>We were ruined, further, by the advances in efficient service distribution at scale. You need things delivered - <em>there&#x2019;s a service for that</em>. Groceries? <em>Yeah, those are covered</em>. Food? Cab? Stationery? <em>Yep, we got those covered too.</em></p> <p>Services would reach you earlier after a week or more, if at all they could reach you. It became days. One day was a stretch goal that was soon met for many. And next was hours. For many services, it is minutes now. <em>30 minutes or free</em>.</p> <p>We have all been ruined by this promise of<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>instant&#x201D;. A detour of 15 minutes before the food is delivered is worthy of a lengthy rant at the service provider now. A delay of a day before one&#x2019;s headphone is delivered is intolerable.</p> <p>Days of patiently waiting for things we need, we <em>want</em> have long been lost. We are ruined by our lack of patience.</p> <hr /> <p>Martin Weigert has an interesting take on this - this is what he wrote while sharing this essay as part if <a href=\"https://meshedsociety.com/meshedsociety-weekly-229/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">his weekly newsletter</a> at Meshed Soceity.</p> <blockquote> <p>(&#x2026;) there are at least 2 types of patience: Waiting for the pay offs of one&#x2019;s work (whether on oneself or external projects), and waiting for things one needs. I consider the first type a virtue. The latter type however, seems to be mostly a mental hack to make a virtue out of necessity. Have to wait for 4 hours to get your 5 minutes at the doctor? Be patient! Have to wait one week to get the thing you bought online? Be patient! Have to wait one day until your bank transfer has been processed? Be patient! In these cases, there is nothing inherently virtuous or positive in waiting.</p> </blockquote> <p>I do not disagree with any part of this. And I was indeed focused on the second type that he talked about because that&#x2019;s primary what he face more often and so is what that tests us the most. It is important that we do not lose our sanity if things do go wrong while we wait for things and have to wait longer.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>It is very tiring to make decisions. There appears to exist a popular perception that decision, once made, leads to some <em>irreversible</em> change to the currently<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>working state&#x201D;. What, then, one has to decide is whether the change was good or bad, and so whether the decision made was right or wrong.</p> <p>This judgement that follows after every decision invariably forces one to question whether it was worth the enforced change. The fear of making the wrong decision is the reason, more often than not, behind the lack inclination to change.</p> <p>You can be deciding what gift to buy for someone or who to choose to be your life partner. It does not matter whether the decision to be made is critical or trivial. Our subconscious is always at work, judging our every decision.</p> <p>However, it is up to you to not let this fear of judgement drive how you lead your life. It is easier to overcome the wrong decisions you make than to lead a life being too indecisive.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>My sister recently bought a new iPhone - her first, switching over from Android - and was happily setting it up with all the apps she had been using. And many more new ones. I did observe one bothersome behavior while she was using her device. She was happily tapping around whenever iOS threw a permission prompt at her, without paying any attention to what the prompt said. <em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Sure, have all the access you need.&#x201D;</em></p> <p>And I do not think she is in minority here. I observe this behavior very often and every single time, I am left completely befuddled. Why would you not read what permission the app is asking for and why would you not question why it needs that?</p> <p>For me, no app gets any permission the first time it asks for it. Everything is disabled by default. Especially the access to my location, microphone or camera. <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/purge-undeserving-notifications\">None</a>. You need to convince me to the core <em>at the right moment</em> that you deserve this privilege. I prefer veering towards extreme stringency of access to my device.</p> <p>As more and more connected, data-hungry devices surround us, it is becoming important to instill awareness amongst the populace of the fallouts minor negligence while using these devices can lead to. Not provoke moral panic, but train to be cognizant towards one&#x2019;s privacy and security. If we ourselves don&#x2019;t put price on our data, we have no right to expect the organizations to lend respect to something that is a primary and sole fuel to their profits.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>A brilliant essay at New Yorker on A.I. and intellectual debt, output of an often employed<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>approach to discovery &#x2014; answers first, explanations later&#x201D;. I was aware of, but never thought in detail on what would be the implications of letting independent, isolated machine learning models interact freely. This example is indeed eyeopening.</p> <blockquote> <p>In 2011, a biologist named Michael Eisen found out, from one of his students, that the least-expensive copy of an otherwise unremarkable used book&#x2014;&#x201C;The Making of a Fly: The Genetics of Animal Design&#x201D;&#x2014;was available on Amazon for $1.7 million, plus $3.99 shipping. The second-cheapest copy cost $2.1 million. The respective sellers were well established, with thousands of positive reviews between them. When Eisen visited the book&#x2019;s Amazon page several days in a row, he discovered that the prices were increasing continually, in a regular pattern. Seller A&#x2019;s price was consistently 99.83 per cent that of Seller B; Seller B&#x2019;s price was reset, every day, to 127.059 per cent of Seller A&#x2019;s. Eisen surmised that Seller A had a copy of the book, and was seeking to undercut the next-cheapest price. Seller B, meanwhile, didn&#x2019;t have a copy, and so priced the book higher; if someone purchased it, B could order it, on that customer&#x2019;s behalf, from A.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Each seller&#x2019;s presumed strategy was rational. It was the interaction of their algorithms that produced irrational results. The interaction of thousands of machine-learning systems in the wild promises to be much more unpredictable.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yep, indeed. May be such interactions need more control? May be we have one more thing about <span class=\"small-caps\">AI</span> to worry about?</p> <blockquote> <p>Much of the timely criticism of artificial intelligence has rightly focussed on the ways in which it can go wrong: it can create or replicate bias; it can make mistakes; it can be put to evil ends. We should also worry, though, about what will happen when A.I. gets it right.</p> </blockquote>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<blockquote> <p>Written languages based on alphabets are one of the great human accomplishments. (&#x2026;) when I write the word<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>human&#x201D; you can fill in what you imagine a human to look like. The word itself carries some fundamental attributes of being a human but the rest is intentionally underspecified. This allows us to use a single word that applies independent of gender, nationality, race, clothing, etc. That is the power of language based on alphabets, because the letters themselves carry no meaning. Even the meaning of a word can evolve over time. For example, the word<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>couple&#x201D; at one point might have meant a male-female couple but is now used to describe any two people who are paired.</p> </blockquote> <p>A thoughtful essay, but I completely disagree. There is an innate assumption here that everyone can read and write English alphabet. It is, in reality, not the case. There are tons of alphabets across nations and regions. In India itself, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_writing_systems\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">there are 11 alphabets</a>. My mom can fluently read and write Devanagari, but that is not the case with English alphabets.</p> <p>Emoji cross the confines of regions - primarily because it is visual. Is it perfect? Of course, not&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;we have managed to mess up the standards in <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/78kzn9/what-the-emoji-youre-sending-actually-look-like-to-your-friends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">implementation across platforms</a>.</p> <p>However, at least, I can send my mom a<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>smile&#x201D; emoji without spelling it out in Devanagari. It was the first thing that lent her confidence to start using smartphones, way before Devanagari support was even introduced.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I picked up this book just as a filler&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;something I read in between when am in no mental state of anything serious. Or something that will make me think. Or will make me sad. So I had very little expectations going in. And the book met my expectations to the T. It wasn&#x2019;t terrible. But I don&#x2019;t think I will remember any part of it after even a month.</p> <p>I have now given up on many<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>memoirs&#x201D; which are nothing more than essays on varied topic. I have realized that they simply don&#x2019;t interest me. Especially humor ones. Fact that I could sit through and complete this book is in itself a surprise for me.</p> <p>One thing that might have worked in favor somewhat is that I listened to this book rather than reading it. I think the experience must have been a tad better. Because&#xA0;..uhmm.. Ellen. But the content just was too patchy overall. Some essays were brilliantly written. They talked about some nice little ideas. And with Ellen&#x2019;s easy-on-ears style of narrating, they made me laugh. Some even made me think. Her journal entries while on beach or her thoughts on having (<em>not?</em>) kids, to note a couple, are damn funny.</p> <p>Others, however, - and there many to be frank - were terrible. Her haikus or bucket lists were just horrible. I don&#x2019;t even know why were there in the book. They weren&#x2019;t funny. They had no reason. They were just&#xA0;.. there. Wish if the chapters that weren&#x2019;t funny at least made me learn something about Ellen&#x2019;s life. Nope. Didn&#x2019;t do even that. Few had just 4-5 words. Not something I enjoy - sorry. Even when I have very low expectations.</p> <p>All in all, this is a terrible memoir, okiesh essay collection, a breezy audiobook. You can listen through it completely over a long drive. You won&#x2019;t miss a thing while you place and collect your order at a drive through. Don&#x2019;t pause. Don&#x2019;t replay. Just let it play on through your drive.</p> <p>Content gets 2 stars. Ellen gets another star. However, I don&#x2019;t think I will pick up another of her earlier books any time soon though. Or any of the essay/memoirs. I am done with this genre.</p>\n",

This recent craze of everyone coming up with their own exclusive content - movies, shows and podcasts now - is really nonsensical to me. Netflix and Amazon started it with their original content and, although arguable, achieved some moderate success.</p> <p>However, we are already seeing trends - if Netflix&#x2019;s recent quarter&#x2019;s earnings are any indication - of people losing interest. One reason I believe (and suffer from) is the sheer quantity of the content available to be consumed. After all, there is only so much time a person can spend glued to their screens- in addition to the time he already spends scrolling through the unlimited stream of bite sized posts.</p> <p>As I had argued earlier, podcast <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/podcasts-is-a-costly-medium-even-for-listeners\">is not a light medium for consumption</a>. It is not music. It is not audiobooks. It is a medium known for culturing the relationship with the listeners over years. Listeners choose whom they form that relationship with by subscribing to a podcast.</p> <p>And they are already weighed down by the choices they <em>have to</em> make.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>So India lost to New Zealand in Semi-Final of the <span class=\"small-caps\">ICC</span> world cup 2019. I have some thoughts.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>It&#x2019;s heartbreaking as hell. Almost at a level of 2003 Final defeat to Australia.</li> <li>Fact that India lost doesn&#x2019;t make it a bad team. They had a couple of shortcomings&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;all surfaced together at the most inopportune phase of the tournament.</li> <li>India had a light middle order, fear was top order failure would be challenging for them to handle&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;exactly what happened.</li> <li>You can&#x2019;t call yourself the champions as long as you keep depending solely on your top 3 and bottom 3 players for majority of the matches. It was always risky going in. There are no bowlers who can bat or batsman who can ball. Something that 1983 and 2011 <span class=\"small-caps\">WC</span> winning Indian cricket teams have in common.</li> <li>Players like Sachin and Sehwag and Yuvraj and Raina who could always spring a surprise and give you a wicket - in addition to the runs they score - were dearly missed.</li> <li>Specifically this match was a series of wrong choices - review lost unnecessarily on the first ball. Tweaking of the settled bowling unit, and also the team towards the later part of the tournament. Dhoni&#x2019;s batting position, especially after early wickets - he had to have walked in at 5/3.</li> </ol> <p>Anyway, all said and done, India remain a very good cricket team. They need to work on the middle order - identify those players who bring in a secondary skill. They haven&#x2019;t lost any respect&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;it&#x2019;s a sport afterall.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Chris Richards, putting his perspective through, does kick a hornet&#x2019;s nest. Something even I have done earlier.</p> <blockquote> <p>I&#x2019;m against podcasts. I think they&#x2019;re tedious and samey and sedative, and when I&#x2019;m feeling especially cranky, I consider them an enemy of music. Most podcasts are conversations for people to eavesdrop on &#x2014; recorded talk that precludes real-life talk about real life with zombie talk about podcasts. Also, I like music. With all of the world&#x2019;s unheard songs beckoning us with their endless mystery, why would anyone choose to waste their precious listening hours on a podcast?</p> </blockquote> <p>Yeah, the topic is a pretty polarizing one. Most vocal voices on online forums may not agree with the Chris&#x2019;s perspective. I myself believe this medium of entertainment or<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>infotainment&#x201D; needs some control to make it useful. As I had <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/podcasts-is-a-costly-medium-even-for-listeners\">quipped earlier</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>I hate podcasts, because the medium is demanding. It demands so much time from me, demands focused attention to follow along. I wish I didn&#x2019;t find them so damn useful to keep giving in to the medium&#x2019;s demands.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yes, I have put some measures to not let podcasts be the static noise in my ears all the time&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;voices and perspective of others on everything. But the reason for that isn&#x2019;t that I do not like those voices. Or the fact that they don&#x2019;t<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>sound good&#x201D;, as Chris seems to argue.</p> <p>I disagree. On the contrary, I believe they sound <em>too</em> good, too polished for my liking. I feel the recent interest in the medium from all the big production/media houses has brought in a lot more investment and so the production chops. The medium does not need that. I tend to stay away from all these new shows.</p> <p>Anyway, for me, the reason that I put restriction on the amount of time I allow podcasts <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/on-podcasts-news-well-being\">is simple</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>I have lately felt hindered by the time I am listening to the same repetitive thoughts from other people on podcasts. Experts talking about, dissecting, the tech news. Or blabbering about something I would not be interested in typically.</p> </blockquote> <p>I have realized the measure I had put in place to limit the medium has worked well for me. I listen to music more. I listen to the audiobooks more. Are they better at not<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>wasting&#x201D; one&#x2019;s time? Now that&#x2019;s purely subjective.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I read this note from Dave Winer on state of publishing on the open web. The first part reads like a fact.</p> <blockquote> <p>It&#x2019;s too hard to publish something to the open web. It has to be available as simple content. Not rendered inside a commercial template.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sure, I agree with this. Publishing on web is a need of time, every person with some access to the internet wishes to post his thoughts and pictures online. More often in closed groups&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;like Whatsapp, iMessage, Messenger etc. But then also on easily <em>accessible</em> and <em>free</em> services - like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc. Highlighted aspects are important.</p> <blockquote> <p>Technically it&#x2019;s a very simple problem, actually. And the raw serving capability is dirt cheap. But it needs a corporate entity to run it.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is those highlighted aspects that makes this a tricky problem. From the demand&#x2019;s perspective, those aspects are of a lot of importance. Majority of the people are neither ready to spend their energies nor their money for the ability to post online. Open web currently fails to address both at the same time. Accessible solutions aren&#x2019;t free. Free solutions aren&#x2019;t accessible.</p> <p>So the supply, mostly from the corporate entities, then caters to just those demands, bringing along the price for serving it.</p>\n",

For me it started with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vladsavov/status/1111872621027774464\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this Twitter thread</a> by Vlad Savov of The Verge where he compared images from this latest phone from Huawei against Pixel 3.

Here&#x2019;s Vlad summarizing his observation in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/1/18290215/huawei-p30-pro-camera-night-low-light-mode-photos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the article</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>In the following example, featuring an unlit bathroom where my eyes could detect shapes but no colors, the <span class=\"small-caps\">P30</span> Pro does the unbelievable by actually focusing and producing a very respectable image.</p> </blockquote> <p>So now these mobile cameras can do better than our eyes? Nice. And this positive view towards the <span class=\"small-caps\">P30</span> camera is shared by almost all tech reviewers. Here&#x2019;s what Engadget <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/29/huawei-p30-pro-camera-test-pixel-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">says about this</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>With less light, zooming, focus and detail should be a struggle, but the <span class=\"small-caps\">P30</span> Pro mostly shrugged it off. The combination of dual <span class=\"small-caps\">OIS</span> on both the primary camera and the telephoto, in addition to the digital image stabilizing trick, gives the phone a better chance to capture images at reduced noise and do it all better.</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, this isn&#x2019;t the perfect smartphone - far from it. It isn&#x2019;t even the hands-down best camera quality and experience on a mobile phone. Rene Ritchie has a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nmWHacg0YE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nice comparison video</a> of the phone with the iPhone <span class=\"small-caps\">XS</span>. It is good to be aware of the capabilities and shortcoming of the overall device.</p> <p>But I am amazed at the speed with which the imaging technology on the smartphones are improving. It was only few months back when we were surprised looking at what the Pixel 3 could achieve with its night-sight feature. And we already have a device that, if not tops, matches that under most conditions.</p> <p>The tech pundits always made us believe that camera tech will be the next big differentiator for the smartphones&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;something that will separate the big, serious players from the emerging ones. However, the way things are going, I don&#x2019;t think that would be the case. The camera modules will again soon be commoditized and everyone would be back to the drawing board in search of that one differentiator.</p> <p>This does not bode well for Google&#x2019;s hardware efforts in smartphones. Apple and Samsung, for whom their brand is the primary selling point, would be pleased with this.</p>\n",

When I look back, I believe one of the reasons behind that was the fact that I was waiting for that right<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>space&#x201D; to work on my thoughts. One that never arrived. I need to stop waiting and spend more time <em>doing</em> stuff than to think whether the moment or the place or the environment or even the words are right. Andy Warhol has put it so perfectly.</p> <blockquote> <p>Don&#x2019;t think about making art, just get it done. Let everyone else decide if it&#x2019;s good or bad, whether they love it or hate it. While they are deciding, make even more art.</p> </blockquote>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Another week, another discussion on the state of social networks on TWiT network. This time it took place on the latest episode of <a href=\"https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-google\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This week in Google</a>&#xA0;. The discussion went on and on about how Google Plus was great. And how other social networks have ruined what made them the best in the first place&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;the posts from the real people and the social aspect around them&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;in their quest to monetize by jacking up the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>engagement&#x201D;.</p> <p>Such discussions happen very often these days. Eventually, they turn towards the alternatives that exists, but always take a long trodden path.</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Facebook is hated by everyone but is ubiquitous, too big. Twitter is loved by no one but stays relevant in discourse. IndieWeb is dull, abstruce. Federated services are great, but <em>no one</em> can get them working. Instagram&#x2019;s the lone messiah, but Mark&#x2019;s working hard to ruin it.&#x201D;</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, the original point on the available alternatives is all but left untouched. I am left frustrated every time by this sheer defeatism, this complete lack of attempt to try earnestly to understand and comment on the alternatives. What all alternatives have you tried? Were there none that were good? If so, why? What is missing? How can they be made better? What is it that you are looking for in a social network?</p> <p>Mike Elgan had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufr7O0qtX9U&amp;t=3251s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this comment</a> on the recent episode of TWiG.</p> <blockquote> <p>I would love a social network that had basically two rules. One is no algorithmic sorting or filtering, when I follow somebody I want everything they post. Second thing is I don&#x2019;t want to get any content that isn&#x2019;t the actual words or photos taken my the person I follow. No sharing, no retweeting.</p> </blockquote> <p>I thought great, <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I know of one</a> that meets these two rules. May be they will recommend it. Or comment on why it is lacking. Nah. Nothing. The topic ended there. I am perplexed at why Micro.blog isn&#x2019;t referenced more often during these discussions on social networks. Sure, it may not be perfect. So go ahead, criticize it. Tell the makers of the service why they can&#x2019;t use it. But do talk.</p> <p>And micro.blog isn&#x2019;t the only one. There&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mastodon</a>. And then there are the independent blogging solutions and <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span>. Generate some buzz for them. You are not helping the situation by cribbing incessantly about the unending missteps of the existing services. Put these same old rants to rest now and crib about the new services. At least, the normal users would know there exist other alternatives and the developers would know what they need to work on.</p>\n",

Especially his first tip - quit reading books you don&#x2019;t like</p> <blockquote> <p>It helps if you choose the right books in the first place. Stop reading what you think you <em>should</em> be reading and just read what you genuinely <em>want</em> to read.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yep, I follow this rule diligently. And I have my own list of<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>gems&#x201D; that just <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/21425016-amit?shelf=not-for-me\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">aren&#x2019;t for me</a>.</p> <p>I also keep my currently reading list loaded with multiple books at a time. Some are as audiobooks, some as e-books. (It&#x2019;s been very long since I read a paperback and it was primarily because <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/kindle-and-paperbacks/\">I just don&#x2019;t enjoy them</a>.)</p> <blockquote> <p>Feel free to read promiscuously &#x2014; date 3 or 4 books at the same time until one makes you want to settle down with it.</p> </blockquote> <p>I do that, but not for the reason Austin mentions. I just like to hop between books at times. Many a times before I give up on one.</p> <p>I really liked these quotes that Austin has included in his post. Ah, I think I need to read a lot more.</p> <blockquote> <p>Nobody is going to get any points in heaven by slogging their way through a book they aren&#x2019;t enjoying but think they ought to read.</p> <p>&#x2014;Nancy Pearl</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>There is only one way to read, which is to browse in libraries and bookshops, picking up books that attract you, reading only those, dropping them when they bore you, skipping the parts that drag &#x2014; and never, never reading anything because you feel you ought, or because it is part of a trend or a movement. Remember that the book which bores you when you are twenty or thirty will open doors for you when you are forty or fifty &#x2014; and vice-versa. Don&#x2019;t read a book out of its right time for you.</p> <p>&#x2014;Doris Lessing, The Golden Notebook</p> </blockquote>\n",

I plan to identify what matters to me the most, what I enjoy doing the most. And then only sign-up for that. I have realized there is no point over-complicating too many things with <em>whys</em> and <em>hows</em>, and especially <em>why-nots</em>. It&#x2019;s better to just do the thing that my mind wants to do without fussing over the right moment or the perfect way. Neither ever arrive.</p> <p>So I will do anything that I <em>want</em> to do. But to that everything that I am not into, but my brain says I <em>should</em> do - nah. Not happening. This has already ruled some of the projects from my list, mostly dev ones, which I had signed up for just because everyone I come across was doing them. Or so I thought.</p> <p>Then there are those projects which I want to do, but just don&#x2019;t have an idea <em>yet</em> about how and when. One such project is my microcast Third-Person Voice.

				"title": "Adding On This Day feature to Blot",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Recently David Merfield, the developer behind Blot, documented the steps to expose a <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed on a Blot site. I <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/on-this-day-a-year-ago\">have been running a <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed</a> for my blog for quite some time now, with some valuable help from David of course. It is this feed that drives the <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/on-this-day\">On This Day</a> page on this blog. I thought I will share my approach so that others with a blog running on Blot can create such a page.</p> <p>To begin with, follow <a href=\"https://blot.im/developers/guides/json-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the guide</a> to get a working <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed for your blog. Validate you have a properly formed and accessible feed being served using the <a href=\"http://validator.jsonfeed.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed validator</a>.</p> <div class=\"note\"> One key thing to understand here is how to create a view in Blot. It would be important to be aware of this step to proceed further. A view can be created in Blot by accessing the <a href=\"https://blot.im/settings/theme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">editing template</a> section (<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Template</strong>) in Blot dashboard. Click on <strong>Edit</strong> against your currently installed theme and search for an option<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span><strong>Create new view</strong><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span>. </div> <p>Once the <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed is available, create a view in Blot for a javascript file. Copy the complete content of the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/am1t/5bcbc5366491c2b010adfe1358877899\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">javascript available as a gist</a><span class=\"marker\">*</span> and add them to this new view. Modify the <code>json_feed_url</code> and <code>tz</code> variables appropriately to reflect the <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span> for the <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed and the timezone for your blog, you can refer to the formats in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"small-caps\">TZ</span> database time zones</a>. This script does the following.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li><strong>Fetches</strong> all the posts as <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> objects from the <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed</li> <li><strong>Identifies</strong> the posts that share the same date and month as the current date (but not the year to avoid loading today&#x2019;s posts)</li> <li><strong>Renders</strong> the posts (or <em>no posts</em> message) in the predefined section detailed below. This also includes some styling via the <code>.className</code> definition, you can remove/modify that as per your liking in fuction <code>renderPost</code>.</li> </ol> <p><underline>Make sure the above created view is accessible at a <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span>.</underline> If not, define a route in the <strong>Settings</strong> section of the view.</p> <p>Next, create another view for a page to display these posts; a reference html page is available <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/am1t/472499285986345f34c61274edd22cdc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">as a gist</a>. Modify the <code>src</code> in <code>&lt;script src=&quot;/flashback.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> to reflects the <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span> for the javascript created above. The script adds and renders the posts made on this day in earlier years in the <code>div</code> element with <code>id</code> <code>on-this-day</code>.</p> <p>Do give this a try, it is fascinating to see your thoughts change, or at times stay exactly the same, over the year. Reach out to me if you face any issues or find any step missing.</p> <div class=\"note\"> <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Expose a <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed on your site. Create two views in Blot using the gist <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/am1t/5bcbc5366491c2b010adfe1358877899\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">flashback.js</a> and <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/am1t/472499285986345f34c61274edd22cdc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on-this-day.html</a>. You should have two additional pages, you can use the same file names. If you do, you can access your On This Day page at <code>/on-this-day</code>. </div> <hr /> <p><small><span class=\"marker\">*</span> This javascript is inspired by and based on the wonderful project <a href=\"https://github.com/cleverdevil/micromemories\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Micro Memories</a> by <a href=\"https://cleverdevil.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jonathan LaCour</a> for the micro.blog hosted blogs.

Netflix managed to solve a lot many technical challenges&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;it is a well-done interactive film. I think first of its kind. But boy, did it suck as a film. The format just did not click for me&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;the film worked neither as a science fiction nor as a horror.</p> <p>To be frank, I am a bit disappointed in this genre of films. There has been so much talk about these choose-your-own-adventure or multiple endings movies/shows. But I find the whole concept a bit distracting. Every time, I was made to choose any aspect playing on the screen, I was pulled out of the flow of the movie. I doubt this interactive form will work for many.</p> <p>Call me old school. But I want to be driven, I want to view the story from the director&#x2019;s perspective. I like to see what he or she wants to show me, keeping my mind completely open. I do not want to play a game while I am watching a movie. Because if I do want to, well, I will play a game in the first place.</p> <p>Sure, this was a good experiment to explore this concept of letting viewers drive the narrative of the film. And although I question its feasibility, I also believe this is just a start. There&#x2019;s soon going to be lot many such experiments with <span class=\"small-caps\">VR</span> too. Whatever the makers believe, I am sure I would hate that form.</p> <p>I wish makers spend their efforts on the story, on the screenplay, on all the other aspects that make a movie brilliant. I will any day choose a linear, single ending drama or a thriller that a director has complete control over than a broken, nonsensical story that I can control every aspect of.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I recently watched<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9319890/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bhai: Vyakti Ki Valli</a><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span>, a movie I was very eagerly waiting for quite some time now. It is a biopic of a person that I adore, an iconic Marathi writer and a humorist, a brilliant theater artist and an adept musician, a person who inspired me to start writing. That person is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purushottam_Laxman_Deshpande\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Purushottam Laxman Deshpande</a>, lovingly called<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Pu. La.&#x201D; or<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Bhai&#x201D; in the region I am from.</p> <p>Narrating the life of this towering personality is not a small feat given the sheer number of stream of art he was passionate about. He is a well-known and a well-respected person amongst Maharashtrians of all age. It is through his writing, through the careful study of human nature around him that he taught many what the real happiness is. So it is only just that I was so curious to learn more about this master, through especially the first of this two-part biopic that focuses on his early life.</p> <p>It was wonderful to know more about this simple person and was refreshing to see the Maharashtra of early 1900. In a way, I thought the people, the society that Bhai dwelt in was a lot more liberal, more open than what we see today. It was pleasing to watch the strong women with definite opinions, the simple marriage or even the relationship that Bhai&#x2019;s wife and his mother share. The finale with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWXbwSUxOW0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a mind-blowing rendition of Hindustani classical music</a> through a couple of well-known songs was sheer magic on screen - left me with goose bumps down my arms. It is Marathi culture on display. It instantly transported me back to my childhood days when these songs were our morning alarms. Boy, how much do I yearn for the simple life of yesteryears?</p> <p>No doubt then that it was a brilliant watch for me, and my family. Even my friends share my experience. But all of us already know a lot about the person and the people around him. The list of characters, from the real-life like Bhimsen Joshi or Kumar Gandarva and from Bhai&#x2019;s imagination like Anna or Namu Parit, that walk the screen are well itched in us Marathi people&#x2019;s memories. But that may not be the case for people not from this state.</p> <p>I wish this movie was an equally well-made biography, not just a celebration of the life of this beloved man. I wish the characters were allowed to grow, introduced at the very least. I wish we learned more about the relationship Bhai shared with these characters. I wish this could have been that one movie I would recommend every friend of mine to watch so that they knew what gem of a person Pu. La. was. But, alas.</p> <p>First thing I did once I was back from the theater was to listen to couple of Pu. La.&#x2019;s story-telling acts. It was heart-warming for me to see many aged couples who could barely walk taking all the effort to come down to the theater with their family and laughing their hearts out. May be they had spent their golden years together watching Bhai live and now they want to re-live those days. So yes, the movie did leave many, including me, nostalgic. May be that was the win the makers were going for.</p>\n",

He talks about why he likes keeping his daily diary.</p> <blockquote> <p>We so often make big decisions in life based on predictions of how we think we&#x2019;ll feel in the future, or what we&#x2019;ll want. Your past self is your best indicator of how you actually felt in similar situations. So it helps to have an accurate picture of your past.</p> </blockquote> <p>It was especially fascinating looking at the list of topics he keeps a journal about. A great, great inspiration for any one looking out for what to journal about. He puts down a prime example.</p> <blockquote> <p>I especially like my<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Regrets&#x201D; journal. Whenever I do something I regret, I write it down there, noting why I regret it, what I wish I would have done instead, and how I hope to prevent this in the future.</p> </blockquote> <p>Derek has given me so much to ponder on. I have bookmarked this, I may reference this every time I question my resolve to journal more. Even outside of a journal, I think this is a great suggestion to write everything.</p> <blockquote> <p>Ask yourself questions, then question your answers.</p> </blockquote> <p>To be frank, it was when I read his account that I got to know that diary and journal are not the same. Apparently, diary is for an account of one&#x2019;s daily activities while journal is for more comprehensive thoughts on specific topics. Some may say that&#x2019;s minutiae, but it&#x2019;s good to know.</p>\n",

And it has been a very productive year writing-wise since then.</p> <p>I have expressed myself a lot more in the past year. I have thought a lot clearer, a lot better as a result. It is all thanks to the wonderful interactions on the platform.</p> <p>What it also means is that I have a year worth of posts to look back upon. And I thought what better way to do so than getting the <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/on-this-day\">On This Day page</a> added to my blog. I have done that. It presents how the journey started - if nothing else I myself can follow the thoughts along as they evolved.</p> <p>Will it stick in this same form? May be not. I may experiment a bit on how I see this feature. But I have got the base working now for my blot-based blog.</p> <p><strong><span class=\"small-caps\">PS</span></strong>: This feature is based on the wonderful project <a href=\"https://github.com/cleverdevil/micromemories\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Micro Memories</a> by <a href=\"https://cleverdevil.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jonathan LaCour</a> for the micro.blog hosted blogs.

				"content_text": "<p>I have <em>finally</em> given up on the hope that Apple will fix their Macbook lineup and have decided to switch to Windows. It was a long time coming, and the decision wasn&#x2019;t an easy one. But what Apple offers, especially in Indian market, isn&#x2019;t worth the price. The lineup from its competitors doesn&#x2019;t allow them and their users to justify their crazy costs. They need a cheaper, better alternative to compete. They needed to replace Air, not launch a new range. They have now failed to do it for 3 years. And I can wait no longer.</p> <p>Will Apple&#x2019;s devices be more durable? Sure. Does it justify to pay, for an entry-level Air, twice the cost of a fully loaded Dell? Absolutely not.</p> <p>So I have got a Dell now. I am not really worried about the switch to Windows 10&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;I do use it in office. I had also analysed my software usage, and except for Markdown writers, there&#x2019;s nothing software-wise that I will miss. My primary need, other than writing, is coding and Microsoft has me covered with <span class=\"small-caps\">VS</span> Code and <span class=\"small-caps\">WSL</span>. Sure, I <em>will</em> miss Terminal, but I think I will manage without it.</p> <p>I am, however, a bit worried about the out-of-box experience, given OEMs are known for screwing Microsoft up with their customisations. Not sure if there are any must-dos and must-haves on a new Windows device. I will look out for any input I can gather. Overall, I guess I would do fine.</p> <p>Of course, I will hold my judgement till I use the device regularly and extensively. My current Macbook Pro has served me well. I wish Apple hadn&#x2019;t forced me with their utter lack of inclination to improve their entry-level offerings. They won&#x2019;t grow into developing markets unless they stop selling the same old story.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Irrespective of what the popular belief is, the need for social networks is not going away &#x2014; more so amongst those who are not technology oriented. Sure, some particular services that exist today may die down. But the medium won&#x2019;t.</p> <p>Just look at <a href=\"http://scalar.usc.edu/works/everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-social-media-but-were-too-afraid-to-ask/history-and-different-types-of-social-media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the history of the social media</a> structures on the Internet. There has always existed a network of some form where every person that was connected could hang out. The initial users that adopted the digital life were techies, so their solutions were comparatively tech-savvy. I remember I have spent hours discussing and debating with my friends on <span class=\"small-caps\">IRC</span> channels and on email groups and on XMPP-based <span class=\"small-caps\">IM</span> clients.</p> <p>I believe even in the world where not everybody and everything was connected, there existed mediums to communicate, to interact, to share. They might have been analog, or of forms that needed one to be in the presence of others. But they existed nonetheless.</p> <p>In today&#x2019;s age of smartphones, it&#x2019;s become a lot simpler to get online and be<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>connected&#x201D; with others. As a result, there are more people, more <em>common</em> non-techies, who are always <a href=\"https://wersm.com/the-10-top-reasons-why-we-use-social-networks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on the look out</a> for simpler ways to share their thoughts once they get online and stay in touch with others. They will sign-up with any service that promises them that. And they did.</p> <p>Sure, the proponents of the open internet, myself included, dislike the current social networking behemoths - Facebook, and Twitter. But I think it is important to not let the disdain for these specific platforms turn into a complete rejection of the medium itself. There will always exist some structure that can facilitate communication in the form of text, images and other share-worthy stuff. The state became dire when we let a set of private entities wall this structure in their silos.</p> <p>No doubt, Facebook and Twitter are in decline today. But the terrible scenario can recur if the common, but rising set of connected users is not provided with more open, more interoperable alternatives that are equally engaging and simple to use. And do so before other silos take over the medium again.</p> <p>I know of the services that already meet the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>open and interoperable&#x201D; characteristic. But the majority contenders reek of<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>by-the-techies-for-the-techies&#x201D; fervour. So there&#x2019;s still a long way to go to meet the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>engaging and simple&#x201D; part&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;the one closest is <a href=\"https://micro.blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Micro.blog</a>. I believe there exists a <a href=\"https://indieweb.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">group of brilliant minds</a> that understands the importance of addressing this. It is incumbent upon this group to work towards that.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I have recently been thinking a lot about making it easier for people to interact on my posts. The commenting systems of yesteryears served well till they were completely ruined by spams and unnecessary hurdles around setting them up and managing them.</p> <p>Since I embraced the IndieWeb, I realised that <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/webmention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">webmentions</a> can potentially address this need. One primary reason that I believe they can fare better than the existing commenting system is the required skills barrier to get started.</p> <p>But I was afraid that the same barrier to<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>entry&#x201D; would also mean not everyone could comment on my posts. It could potentially limit the audience, especially one that interacts, to the developer niche that understands IndieWeb. But I was pleased that wasn&#x2019;t the case. More on <em>why</em> later, first a quick comment on comments.</p> <p>I am not alone who is fed up of the commenting systems. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dave Winer</a> has since long turned off the responses on his posts. And in recent times he also has been particularly <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/08/02/141534.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unhappy with Disqus</a>, his selected replacement to the in-built responses. So, he <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/12/31/155551.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">found out his way</a> to enable a commenting mechanism that did not need constant managing. Plus at the same time, had an entry barrier of sorts. He now <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/12/31/155551.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">uses Twitter reposts</a> for comments.</p> <blockquote> <p>Use the <i class=\"fa fa-retweet\"></i> [retweet] feature here on Scripting News more. It&#x2019;s a way to comment on what&#x2019;s going on here, without using Disqus.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sure, it meets the need. You need not manage a separate commenting system. You can follow tweets <em>on Twitter</em> - they are closer to post <em>on Twitter</em>. And Dave publishes <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> feed of all the comments. So he, and the readers, can receive all the comments.</p> <p>For me personally though, this does not meet the one main criteria - it keeps the responses away from the posts, hence from the context. And inadvertently from the readers too. There&#x2019;s no way then to inspire any inclination amongst readers to contribute and be part of an ongoing conversation on the post.</p> <p>So, back to webmentions. I can display mentions along with my post (and with <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/display-webmentions/\">this recent guide</a> I had written, you can too) and that means any reader at my blog is aware of the sort of discussion that&#x2019;s taking place over the post. If you see my recent posts, they have significant interactions between multiple people.</p> <p>But where is this discussion taking place? And how can one be part of it? It&#x2019;s primarily all happening on <a href=\"https://micro.blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">micro.blog</a>. The platform fosters a pleasant community of many creative and open minds. It also encourages meaningful conversations over mindless reactions. And Manton, the mind behind Micro.blog, is a <a href=\"https://manton.org/2018/09/07/the-way-out.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">firm proponent of the open web</a>.</p> <p>I wish more people become part of the platform - better, support the platform by subscribing to the paid plans. And one of the ways I thought I can advertise the platform and bring it to the attention of many is by prominently displaying it along with posts. So, now for every posts on this blog with conversations at micro.blog, there will be a clear<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Discuss on Micro.blog&#x201D; link that takes you directly to the conversation thread (<a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/1546473053307\">example</a>).<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>You want to comment? Please join Micro.blog.&#x201D;</p> <p><img src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/5125b5c51a.jpg\" alt=\"Discuss on M.b\"></p> <p>That would, in addition, be a nudge to post a longer response on one&#x2019;s own website.</p> <p>My hope is this will exhibit the biggest asset of the micro.blog platform, it&#x2019;s community, in context and as a result, inspire more people to join with a ready-to-access link to the place where the conversation is taking place. If a significant section of the platform users, one that can, starts to display the conversations (webmentions) and starts to include such links, we should soon have an extremely diverse set of users joining the platform.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>2018, for me, was a year of many firsts. To be frank, I was uncharacteristically active overall&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;so much so that I startled myself at multiple times throughout the year with the liveliness. I possessed heaps of clarity in terms of what I was working on, both within and outside of the profession.</p> <p>Sure, if I look outward, 2018 has left the world in complete disarray. There is chaos, unclarity all around. There is an inconspicuous tension building up in every part of the world. A lack of trust, faith in one another. In humanity.</p> <p>2018 may very well be remembered as the year when the word<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>true&#x201D; lost all its meaning. A fight to drum up the perception that my truth is the <em>only</em> truth made one insensitive of everything that was being said by anyone.</p> <p>And it did get tiring. As Scaachi Koul <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/scaachikoul/2018-year-end-exhaustion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rightly said</a>,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>2018 wore us all the hell out&#x201D; (h/t <a href=\"https://www.inthemargins.ca/micro-6978c72c-3df7-4555-a4e2-de3505877819\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sameer Vasta</a>). I empathise with her when she says</p> <blockquote> <p>I am usually energized by arguing, by getting aggressive, by putting a name or a face to an enemy, online or otherwise. Not this year.</p> </blockquote> <p>But then I have decided to remember 2018 for the goods it brought me personally.</p> <p>I expressed. Kept churning up more longer posts and lots and lots of shorter microposts.</p> <p>I captured. Snapped a significant part of my life as pictures. Posted them, shared them more.</p> <p>I learnt. Understood. And got enamoured by IndieWeb.</p> <p>I developed. Worked on so many <a href=\"http://github.com/am1t/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new projects</a> - many found useful even by few others.</p> <p>I experimented. Recorded <a href=\"https://monday.micro.blog/2018/10/01/episode-amit.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a first podcast episode</a>. Started <a href=\"http://voice.amitgawande.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a new individual podcast</a>.</p> <p>Unlike me, I gave up a lot lesser in 2018. Almost everything I noticed above was taken to completion.</p> <p>And most importantly, I lived. Quality time with people closest to me. Family reunions. Getaways. Holidays. Making new friends, in real and digital life.</p> <p>Yep. I will remember 2018 as a year of being satisfied. And being alive. It is only fair to welcome 2019 with a clean, untidy slate.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>This is such fascinating write up by Sinclair Target on history behind the challenges <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> has faced over the years. And also why it just never managed to succeed&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;even though it had the backing of all the major publishers, at least everyone adopted and served it.</p> <blockquote> <p>Today, <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> is not dead. But neither is it anywhere near as popular as it once was. Lots of people have offered explanations for why <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> lost its broad appeal. Perhaps the most persuasive explanation is exactly the one offered by Gillmor in 2009. Social networks, just like <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span>, provide a feed featuring all the latest news on the internet. Social networks took over from <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> because they were simply better feeds. They also provide more benefits to the companies that own them.</p> </blockquote> <p><span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> isn&#x2019;t dead, yet. It still serves all the podcasts feeds, and there are a large number of users, including me, for whom it is the only source of any timeline of sort. But the fact cannot be denied that it does not draw any attention from big technology companies. With <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1477667#c0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Firefox too recently dropping the built-in feed support</a>, it became clear everyone wants the standard to exists but no one wants to work on improving and maintaining it. Wish it did not stagnate.</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> might have been able to overcome some of these limitations if it had been further developed. Maybe <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> could have been extended somehow so that friends subscribed to the same channel could syndicate their thoughts about an article to each other. Maybe browser support could have been improved. But whereas a company like Facebook was able to<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>move fast and break things,&#x201D; the <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> developer community was stuck trying to achieve consensus. When they failed to agree on a single standard, effort that could have gone into improving <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> was instead squandered on duplicating work that had already been done.</p> </blockquote> <p>I believe that is <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/927/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the story of how standards proliferate</a>. But I just hope more people realize the importance of the <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> standard for the existence of open web and work on evangelizing and advance it.</p> <p>If we stay dependent on technology companies to back it, we will always end-up with siloed timelines. For them, achieving consensus and coexisting with other players is costlier. It is cheaper to foster user engagement in a walled platforms controlled centrally by the owners. Companies will always go with the cheaper options.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>This is such a fascinating read &#x2014; so detailed on how Andrey Sitnik planned for and went through this arduous experiment.</p> <blockquote> <p>Then I asked myself if<span class=\"push-single\"></span> <span class=\"pull-single\">&#x2018;</span>technological fasting&#x2019; could do one good in modern society. Technology has changed the world in the blink of an eye, leaving us no time to reflect on it. What if a month without modern technology could<span class=\"push-single\"></span> <span class=\"pull-single\">&#x2018;</span>travel&#x2019; you to the past? What if there is a way you could compare your technology-relying self to what you once were?</p> </blockquote> <p>It is really curious to read how the analogue tools &#x2014; for his camera, his watch, a map, a compass and of course a notepad and a pen - were key in taking him through. Of course, it needs planning to keep your brain busy without a stream of digital updates and reads to chomp on. To keep feeding it with activities.</p> <blockquote> <p>Boredom was the thing that scared me the most, so I did a lot of preparation: took a few thick books, drew up a schedule (when I leave one place for another) and made up several evening rituals to follow every day. The internet-less reality turned out to be a boredom-less one, too. Recreation does not require anything special&#x2014;in the end, you can always go out and hunt for good photos.</p> </blockquote> <p>I wish I could undertake such an abstinence from the technology around me. Not because I hate my current state (doesn&#x2019;t mean I do not even). But because I wish I too could arrive at a conclusion very similar to Andrey&#x2019;s.</p> <blockquote> <p>I came to the conclusion that <span class=\"small-caps\">IT</span> hadn&#x2019;t changed the world around, but created another, a parallel one. The reason we are always nervous and never have enough time is that we are living two lives now. It&#x2019;s without a doubt difficult, yet how interesting it is to be living two times as much!</p> </blockquote> <p>Do read this &#x2014; even though we know most deep down the ills of our constant connectedness, it is eye-opening to read someone record his experiences. If possible, we should take Andrey&#x2019;s advice. I, for sure, am seriously considering it.</p> <blockquote> <p>I would not recommend digital fasting to everyone, but a temporary abstinence of some sort seems a very right thing to do</p> </blockquote>\n",

				"content_text": "<blockquote> <p>But what is true today is that not all Chinese phone software is bad. And when it is bad from a Western perspective, it&#x2019;s often bad for very different reasons than the bad Android skins of the past. Yes, many of these phones make similar mistakes with overbearing <span class=\"small-caps\">UI</span> decisions &#x2014; hello, Huawei &#x2014; and yes, it&#x2019;s easy to mock some designs for their obvious thrall to iOS. But these are phones created in a very different context to Android devices as we&#x2019;ve previously understood them.</p> <p>The Chinese phone market is a spiraling behemoth of innovation and audacity, unlike anything we&#x2019;ve ever seen. If you want to be on board with the already exciting hardware, it&#x2019;s worth trying to understand the software.</p> </blockquote> <p>What Chinese smartphones offer is the feature parity in hardware with high-end devices from well-known brands, like Apple, Samsung, at a price which is affordable to the mainstream market. It is difficult to convince someone to buy an iPhone when all the devices are presented along with their specs. Doesn&#x2019;t matter then if the software experience is ripped off.</p> <p>What I feel is troubling though and a thing that gets neglected is the durability of these devices. The maximum life of these is what the warranty is - typically an year. Most often, these devices start failing at performance or battery or overall system level even before it hits that period. And when it does, there always are new cheaper devices to replace them with.</p> <p>This will never get covered by reviews &#x2014; because reviewers move on to the new, shiny devices in a week or two. It&#x2019;s the mainstream that suffers. However, brands that overcome this behaviour outlive ones that fade away sooner.</p>\n",

Current Air is a mockery with that dated screen and processor and the tiny storage. Just update those, keep everything the same. Don&#x2019;t touch that keyboard (<em>no pun intended</em>). And <strong>don&#x2019;t make Macbook One the new Air</strong> in its current form&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;one port is not enough.</li> <li><strong>Non-Pro iMac:</strong> If you can give me a laptop, give me the updated iMac. Again, change nothing big. Just update the processor and if possible, get rid of that 5400rpm hard drive. Just make Fusion drive the default.</li> <li><strong>Mac Mini:</strong> You know there is that tiny device being sold on that tiny corner of your website right? Yeah that, update that. I would love to have it run some side projects.</li> <li><strong>iOS changes for iPad:</strong> I know you will refresh iPad Pros. But in the current form, the iOS platform seems underwhelming on these loaded iPad devices. Make it do more. To start with, get rid of that static-grid springboard.</li> </ol> <p>I wish Apple goes crazy a bit. It is ok to be doing the stuff thoughtfully, making things that work well. That sell well.

So it gets that screen. Sure, Apple always has a Plus size device with a better resolution screens. That need is addressed by <span class=\"small-caps\">XS</span> this year.</p> <p>So am not sure why there is such a huge pushback on <span class=\"small-caps\">XR</span> devices. If reviews are anything to go by, these screens are just as good as Apple&#x2019;s <span class=\"small-caps\">LCD</span> screens have ever been. Are there cheaper Android devices that have screens with better resolutions? Of course. There will always exists cheaper devices with better configuration on paper than iPhone. But I think one thing tech nerds should have learnt by now, Apple never plays the configuration game.</p>\n",

				"title": "On Podcasts, News and Well-being",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I have lately felt hindered by the time I am listening to the same repetitive thoughts from other people on podcasts. Experts talking about, dissecting, the tech news. Or blabbering about something I would not be interested in typically.</p> <p>I realised it had become a problem when these podcasts kept playing as static noise in the background&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;irrespective of whether I was working or driving or eating breakfast. In that sense, I agree with <a href=\"http://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/dialing-down\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"small-caps\">CGP</span> Grey&#x2019;s thoughts</a> on podcasts as he dialled down his consumption on the internet.</p> <blockquote> <p>But podcasts have taken too much ground in my mind: any moment of idleness can be instantly filled with the thoughts of others.</p> <p>I firmly believe that boredom is good for brain health, and I&#x2019;m banishing podcasts for the month from my phone to bring boredom back into my life.</p> </blockquote> <p>I had cut back on my podcast subscriptions just a week before <span class=\"small-caps\">CGP</span> Grey first talked about his experiment on Hello Internet. And the way, he worded his reasons for why giving up on podcasts was a key part of his experiment to reduction just persuaded me to go ahead with my plan.</p> <p>So I have 10 subscriptions (down from 35) now, with just 3 technology related podcasts. One releases on Monday, another on Wednesday and the last one on Friday. That&#x2019;s it, the week&#x2019;s quota of the technology news is covered. One podcasts is a microcast, arrives on Monday. There four are the only ones that are set to auto-downloads. All the remaining 6 are released without any fixed schedule. I decide whether to listen to them only after I read what they are about and if that interests me.</p> <p>I have been on this<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>diet plan&#x201D; of podcasts consumption for at least a month now and I am already observing significant differences. I am listening to music, a lot more, again. My mind has become curious again - there is space for some thought experiments. There are times when I just don&#x2019;t carry my headphones with me even when I am going to places alone. Anyway, with nothing to listen to, there is no incentive to carry them along. So I either read on my phone or just talk to people around. <em>Surprisingly</em>, I find it a lot better, more effective use of the time.</p> <p>However, this also means I have some time to fill during my drive to office or the morning/evening runs. To address that, I have renewed my Audible subscription&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;listening to Audiobooks would at least be better than podcasts. Or so I think, for now.</p> <h2 id=\"no-news-experiment\">No-news Experiment</h2> <p>I was also on <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/journal/65762/\">an experiment</a> 3 months back where I had decided that the only way I would consume news would be via my morning newspaper. And my hypothesis was I would feel a lot less burdened to know what&#x2019;s going on and so be a bit more focused on the work at the hand.</p> <p>As an extension, I had also uninstalled all the related apps. No Twitter. No news apps. No notifications from social apps (Messages, WhatsApp). The idea was it is just better to stay away from the temptation to check <em>what&#x2019;s going on</em>.</p> <p>I am glad that I have following the set rules for 3 months now and I thought it would be right moment to update on that experiment.</p> <p>It indeed is a not less burdensome to be away from the news. I do not think I have missed anything major or urgent in these last few months. Newspaper provides me with the detailed reporting and not just blurbs. Opinion pieces provide better context on the important ones. The useless news, whose whole purpose is to satisfy the need for the news website or <span class=\"small-caps\">TV</span> channels to keep<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>reporting&#x201D; something, anything new, get filtered out by the editors. After all, there is a limited pace to fill in the pages on the printed paper.</p> <p>So I am no longer bludgeoned with a constant stream of everything that&#x2019;s negative. With that, I think there is a lot less crap in the world than I was made to believe.</p> <p>Is it bad out there? Sure. But at least I ain&#x2019;t bogged down by the insignificant drivel that the world is full of.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I don&#x2019;t understand Google&#x2019;s call screening feature. How does it solve the spam calls problem? Don&#x2019;t I have to be equally attentive when the call arrives? I don&#x2019;t think the problem is I have to <em>receive</em> the call, problem is I <em>get</em> the call in the first place.</p> <p>Rather I am more distracted reading transcripts and making decisions. It looks to be targeted at the automated machine-driven calls. Human spammers/scammers will still have to be handled.</p> <p>In most cases, the spam calls I get start with a person, a human, asking if it indeed is me. Then goes on to specify the call is about some information related to my account or a service I am using. And then comes the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>offer for you&#x201D; part. I tend to disconnect right at first step when someone wants to know if me is indeed me.</p> <p>What&#x2019;s to say the call screening will transcribe something like<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>This is xyz from abc bank and this is a service information call.&#x201D;?</p> <p>Anyway, no doubt Google has a great technology at its hands and the showcase via this use case sounds a lot coherent than the general duplex demo we saw during I/O. I am just perplexed how everyone seems to be already sold that this solves the problem which it isn&#x2019;t even targeting.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> The post isn&#x2019;t intended to be judgemental of the feature, rather it was, to be frank, in response to the constant perspective of<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>this is so useful, I need it now&#x201D; from all around. But I could hardly understand why. John Gruber&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/10/11/nguyen-pixel-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this comment</a> finally triggered this.</p> <blockquote> <p>man oh man, do I want that feature (<em>Call Screening</em>) on iOS.</p> </blockquote> <p>Even Sarah Perez described the problem with scam calls succinctly in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/10/apple-needs-a-feature-like-googles-call-screen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">her opinion piece</a> at TechCrunch.</p> <blockquote> <p>Nearly half of all cellphone calls next year will be from scammers. And their tactics have gotten much worse in recent months.</p> <p>They now often trick people by claiming to be the <span class=\"small-caps\">IRS</span>, a bank, government representatives, and more. They pretend you&#x2019;re in some sort of legal trouble. They say someone has stolen your bank card. They claim you owe taxes. Plus, they often use phone number spoofing tricks to make their calls appear local in order to get recipients to pick up.</p> </blockquote> <p>I get it, it&#x2019;s a problem. But Call Screening solves it how? I could not find the answer to that question in the whole post.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><strong>Update:</strong> David has added a <a href=\"https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot/commit/0eb301b8c64a48843c54f1401d8ce0c61f2c6143\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new function</a> <span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>to step around the issues micro.blog was having with images in Blot&#x2019;s <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> feeds&#x201D;. This change should allow using the Blot&#x2019;s caching feature.</p> <p>For all the defaults templates, David has already deployed the fix. So you should have the issue sorted without any update. If you have a custom template, to enable this change, wrap the html component around with the function <code>absoluteURLs</code> in your <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> file. For example, if you use <code>html</code>, use the below block in your description feed of your rss file (typically <code>feed.rss</code>).</p> <pre><code>{ {#absoluteURLs}} { { {html}}} { {/absoluteURLs}}</code></pre> <hr /> <p>When you publish a micro post (one without title) on Blot which has images in it, Blot uses a <span class=\"small-caps\">CDN</span> by default to store for these images. Though it may be helpful overall in blog performance, it causes some issues while interoperating with micro.blog. You will find that these images are not visible on its timeline.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s a known issue where micro.blog is unable to parse these images. To enable the images posted on Blot to appear on micro.blog timeline, make following changes with the configuration.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>You can disable the blot cdn. This option is available on the Blot <a href=\"https://blot.im/settings/services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">settings</a> page under Settings &gt; Services &gt; Cache And Optimize Images. This makes the images be served directly under your blog&#x2019;s domain. This change does not take much time to propagate, you will see the change reflect in the <code>url</code> for the images.</li> <li>In addition, by default (in most themes), images may have relative urls. For example, you might just put <code>\\_images\\&lt;IMAGE_NAME&gt;</code> while adding the image to the post. However,these relative paths are again not parsed by micro.blog well (though most feed readers do it well). Anyway, to overcome this problem just include the complete url of the image while adding it (for example, <code>http://&lt;BLOGNAME&gt;/&lt;PATH&gt;</code>).</li> </ol> <p>These changes should be enough to allow your images to be visible at m.b timeline.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>It&#x2019;s been some time now that I have started again to regularly write, post my thoughts. Long and short. One of the key reason for this change in my behaviour, my returned inclination to write has been the changed follow behavior. I am reading interesting posts that make me think, that make me question my beliefs. And for each such question, I have a reaction &#x2014; a post.</p> <p>It is all thanks to the community at Micro.blog for convincing me that every post, irrespective of how short it is, is worth putting out there. It is a way to be social. I was doing so on other social networks like Twitter anyway - through all the likes, tweets and retweets. Why not take it to the next level and do the same on, as <a href=\"http://inessential.com/2018/02/01/why_micro_blog_is_not_another_app_net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brent Simmons had called it</a>, <em>the</em> social network - the web?</p> <blockquote> <p>But if you think of the years 1995-2005, you remember when the web was our social network: blogs, comments on blogs, feed readers, and services such as Flickr, Technorati, and BlogBridge to glue things together.</p> </blockquote> <p>And so that is what I have been doing. Reading from the web, reacting on the web - my website.</p> <p>IndieWeb also played a huge part in helping me to go social on web though. It allowed me to post to my site my reactions to what I was reading on web. I could easily like a post, reply to it or even repost part of it and that in itself became a new post on my site - I called them the social posts. So as long as I had the posts tagged with appropriate microformats and was able to send a webmention to a site, I was interacting on web.</p> <p>I need not be part of any siloed platform, I need not shout. All that mattered was I expressed. And just with that, I have been the most social I ever was online.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I am a serial procrastinator, I am not proud of it. Any hint of a distraction and I go crazy running behind that.</p> <p>I also lack the skill to follow a routine. I lack the drive to not miss the day-to-day<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>schedule&#x201D; every day, weekday and weekend alike. I think I have been shaped by the societal dislike for any thing routine.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span><em>Routine is boring</em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span>, I have been told since childhood. But I am slowly coming to realise that a daily routine may be the best solution to my procrastination problem.</p> <p>My dad loves his routine. He wakes up at exactly the same time daily, carries out the same morning choir. He goes for his morning walk. Follows that up with his morning tea and a newspaper. He gets ready for his office. He has his lunch and drives to his office. Spends the same amount of time working. Comes back at home at exactly the same time. A serial or two on television, then dinner. Plan and prepare for the next day. Gets his end of day dose of news. Finally, he goes to bed just as he wakes up, at same time daily. And I have seen him following this routine of his at least since I remember. And even being close to sixty, he looks a lot less tired and a lot more fresh than any of us in thirties do.</p> <p>Procrastination is a blanket idea all problems are swept under. But it&#x2019;s the lack of routine which causes most of the issues in the first place. A routine may lend that time to procrastinate at that odd moment.</p> <p>And the current lifestyle of mine is largely at fault. I tend to spend time in office till the work is done, which rarely gets done in time anyway. All that causes is random office hours. I do things which do not fit in the regular schedule - I would watch a live match or binge watch a new series late into the night. Weekends are marked for getaways, that means just lazy around, neither being productive nor relieved. I never go to sleep on time, so I never wake at the same time.</p> <p>So, on this birthday I decided to stop leading my life so. I am going to follow a routine. I have been sleeping on the same time, getting up on the same time. Reaching office and leaving for home at the same time. I next need to plan the rest of the day too, fit my other interests around the routine tasks.</p> <p>I need to get inspired by my dad. Doesn&#x2019;t matter then if I get called a bore. I believe it would be worth it if I am at least a tad more satisfied.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I read <a href=\"https://ha.x0r.be/posts/chrome-is-a-google-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this interesting perspective from B&#xE1;lint</a> where he argues that<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Chrome is a Google Service that happens to include a Browser Engine&#x201D;. I understand where he is coming from, but I believe the thought process needs to be dealt with and curbed before it gets commonly accepted.</p> <p>Sure, Google would want to believe that Chrome is just one of their many services&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;it suits their business model. When they can move their trackers (and eventually ads) right to the tool that people access the internet with, they would know what everyone&#x2019;s doing on the internet. But Google should not be allowed to get away by dumping the idea down its user&#x2019;s throat. Sure, normal people may not be able to differentiate how logging in to a service and to Chrome is different. Or how login/session cookies for Google may screw up the security model on a shared computer.</p> <p>But that exactly is the reason why people who understand better need to voice their disapproval. It is easy to say that it&#x2019;s not a big deal as I am already better informed to not use Chrome. But it is also reckless&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;Chrome has already become a de facto browser for mainstream users. It&#x2019;s a wrong precedent then to let people who cannot fully grasp (or aren&#x2019;t inclined to out of sheer neglect) the basic underpinnings of the open web to drive what&#x2019;s acceptable for a browser, and on the web. If that was allowed, Net neutrality would already have been a lost battle worldwide. Such decisions tend to be uninformed and harm the community in the longer run.</p> <p>An internet service is a different entity, it serves a specific purpose. It solves a specific problem that an end user has. Gmail is an email client. YouTube is a video sharing service. Google Search is&#x2026; well, it has long since stopped being just a search engine. But, one gets the idea. You access a <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span> and it brings you to the service.</p> <p>Chrome is not that. Chrome is a tool that allows users access these different services. And it is better if it stays that way. It&#x2019;s already bad that all browsers come with an incognito mode by default. It would be important that we do not introduce another mode just to go incognito from the owners of the browsers.</p> <p>I am sure B&#xE1;lint will agree and his final thought kind of sums it well.</p> <blockquote> <p>Part of me feels that this Chrome shared computer issue that Googlers mentioned is real, but it&#x2019;s also just too convenient to solve this by tieing Chrome closer to Google, you know?</p> </blockquote>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>There is a fascinating conversation on <a href=\"https://thisiscriminal.com/episode-97-palace-of-justice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">episode 97 of the Criminal podcast</a> with the now 99 year old <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Ferencz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Benjamin Ferencz</a>. He primarily talks about his experiences as an investigator of Nazi war crimes after the World War <span class=\"small-caps\">II</span>. There are some gut-wrenching stories about the atrocities he witnessed against Jews, and against humanity. He also shares his experiences of his trial against the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>high-ranking members of Nazi Germany&#x2019;s death squad&#x201D;, a trial that he called<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>the plea of humanity to the law&#x201D;.</p> <p>But towards the end of the episode, there is this heart-warming tale from Mr.&#xA0;Ferencz. He talks about his wife who is 5 years older than him; whom he has been married to for last 72 years; whom he had never had a quarrel with. And he believes there is a very simple reason for that.</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>First of all, I am not suggesting we didn&#x2019;t have differences of opinion. But we never raised our voice. We never shouted. We never pounded a table. Because it&#x2019;s mutual respect, and caring for each other. They have a funny word for it that I don&#x2019;t like - love. I don&#x2019;t like the word. Because you could love a piece of cheese, you love that lovely day. I could love to go home. I would love to finish this interview. And I say if you say caring for somebody, that reflects better. And my wife now needs my care. This is the pay back time.&#x201D;</p> </blockquote> <p>Now and again, it helps to keep things simple - I guess experience must imbue you with such clarity of thoughts. From all the myriad of swanky adulations for the word and the feeling of<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>love&#x201D;, I would prefer the simplicity of<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>caring for somebody&#x201D;.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>We need a directory of microbloggers. This fact is clear from the sheer number of discussions that happen on the <a href=\"https://micro.blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Micro.blog</a> platform asking for recommendations on users by interests, or geography or something else.</p> <p>I just wanted to put down my thoughts on what such a directory would need to have for it to be helpful and not polluted with mess.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>Directory needs to have a vouch mechanism. A user mentions some information about himself, his followers vouch for that. And the vouch&#x2019;s what matters. Without such a mechanism, the system is prone to abuse, where people can pollute it with catchy tags without nothing to back it up with. We know how such systems are gamed. <span class=\"small-caps\">SEO</span>. App Store tag words.</li> <li>Other users should be able to associate more information about a person, an extension of vouch. They only get shown if the concerned person accepts.</li> <li>Group types need to be limited. Possible options for groups need to be predefined. So geography - possibly timezones or countries, interests - sports or tech or writing etc, current events followed. Without this, it&#x2019;s again prone to abuse. This may also make aggregation/interface easier to manage. Tagmoji is already a good example.</li> <li>As <a href=\"https://micro.blog/bradenslen/839473\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brad Enslen</a> opined, may be it should not be limited to micro.blog platform. One should be able to provide other details too. May be via IndieAuth signin?</li> <li>An option to add to directory directly from a post would be handy. It may also allow building metadata for the vouch system, if needed.</li> <li>A person&#x2019;s interests, geography, isn&#x2019;t it an extension of one&#x2019;s identity? Can it not be captured as part of one&#x2019;s <code>h-card</code>?</li> </ol> <p>Can such a directory exist outside of Micro.blog? Sure (I even had basic one running on <a href=\"http://microthreads.amitg.xyz/micro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Micro.threads</a> dev). But for it to be helpful it would need a significant number of users adding their information to such a service. I believe it fits best with the platform, as the list of users is already available. With some metadata added, a directory page, just like there are Tagmoji pages for posts, can be enabled for users. This will avoid creating a parallel user list, which will always be lesser than what would exists with the platform.</p> <p>Directory can be made as tricky as it can get. But it is sure one is required as the number of microbloggers grow. Blogrolls, personal directories on individual blogs are good starts. We need a place where that can be brought all together. And displayed easily on demand.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>There is a lot of chatter recently around the features on Twitter/Facebook that should be incorporated in the new<a href=\"#footnote-1WLI\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-1WLI\"><sup>1</sup></a> social media platforms. Or even the lack of the Twitter/Facebook like features that make the platforms better. Just look at the timelines at any of these platforms and you are bound to see some meta discussion on these lines. You will see it on Micro.blog. You will see it on Mastodon.</p> <p>Let&#x2019;s just take a couple of examples. Here&#x2019;s how Mastodon&#x2019;s boost <a href=\"https://www.codesections.com/blog/mastodon-elevator-pitch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">is presented as better</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Boosts are essentially like retweets, with one key difference: there&#x2019;s no option to add your own commentary. You simply can&#x2019;t post something awful with a message saying how awful it is&#x2014;all you can do is boost something awful without commentary.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, I can&#x2019;t be the only one to remember the early Twitter days when retweets were just that, without commentary. It was all the third party clients that had an option to<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>quote&#x201D; tweet. Remember those days of appending<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span><span class=\"small-caps\">RT</span>:&#x201D;, etc? We were using the feature and Twitter was forced to officially support it.</p> <p>Same was the case with hashtags, another feature that made experience on Twitter a nightmare - but was brought in because users were<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>enjoying&#x201D; it. We kept boasting we brought the hashtags to Twitter and now we want nothing to do with it.</p> <p>Don&#x2019;t get me wrong here. I do not want to sound like a Twitter apologist. The platform is in a dire state and their current and previous owners are rightly to be blamed here. As I <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/1534753789149\">recently wrote</a>, I have no sympathy for these folks. Examples mentioned above are not the primary reasons why Twitter, and Facebook, are struggling.</p> <p>But it is worth considering the fact that many of the features being touted as responsible for Twitter&#x2019;s fall are ones introduced by its users.</p> <p>So a plea to all the decision makers behind these<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>new&#x201D; platforms - don&#x2019;t let us, your users, drive the roadmap for you. We cannot foresee what&#x2019;s right. You on the other hand can decide where you want to take your platform. That may mean some people won&#x2019;t ride along and get left behind. But, at times, it is better to follow what&#x2019;s right in the long run than chase the immediate growth.</p> <p>I know people behind both Micro.blog and Mastodon are making these design decisions very carefully<a href=\"#footnote-2WLI\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-2WLI\"><sup>2</sup></a>, and are not heeding to the pressure.</p> <p>So just stick to your beliefs, Manton, Eugen and others.

It has to be posted on my blog first and may then flow into other systems. <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/POSSE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"small-caps\">POSSE</span></a>.</p> <p>Micro.blog was covered, via feeds. It had also got me covered for Twitter. Mastodon didn&#x2019;t look to be an easy case. There is no easy way to push updates from feeds to Mastodon. Web hooks may be the only feasible way. I thought I had to get a more seamless solution than that.</p> <p>And what better may to do that than syndicating right while posting. So I have updated <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/blotpub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blotpub</a> to support syndication to Mastodon. I can now indicate the Micropub clients to syndicate current posts to Mastodon. Nice!</p>\n",

I <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/why-not-quit-twitter\">had also expressed</a> why I can&#x2019;t quit Twitter completely for now - there are still a few people left there whom I follow, and a few friends.</p> <p>I recently had a discussion with one such friend whom I was trying to convince to give up on Twitter and move all his posting to his custom domain. I demoed Micro.blog and Blot, hoping that the simplicity of getting started would be enough to abate any friction the change might throw at him.</p> <p>He listened patiently, he is an active poster on Twitter. He has a distinct voice and perspective towards all varied things. And so my attempt had a selfish tinge too; it would help me if I could follow his posts in feed readers, even better if on Micro.blog.</p> <p>He looked genuinely curios.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>But what&#x2019;s the big deal with owning the content and the domain?&#x201D; I thought I had his attention.</p> <p>I gave him the standard pitch, primarily how it would lend him control of his online identify, allow him not to lose his words when some private silo decides to change the rules of its services and how, if that happens, he can decide to take his content and move to some place better.</p> <p>All he said in response was<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>what&#x2019;s so special with what I write on the web that I would want to maintain it over time? If Twitter dies tomorrow, I will just move to some place else.&#x201D;</p> <p>I was left astonished. Here&#x2019;s a guy who has been posting his opinions on all things, at times even as Tweetstorms, sharing some fascinating stuff for all; here&#x2019;s a guy who has produced at least a short novel worth of content on Twitter and Facebook, but <em>has the least attachment to his words</em>.</p> <p>May be it&#x2019;s a regional trend, may be people in some places are more forward, more open to spending money and effort for the control.</p> <p>But one thing is for sure. We can never convince people to give up silos and start owning their identities, their content on their own domain or start moving to services like Micro.blog till we make them realise how worthy the words they write are. Even tweet length ones.</p>\n",

I do not think there is any debate on whether Artificial Intelligence will have some unplanned consequences. There would be. It is as good as a new <em>species</em>. And when two new species start communicating with one another, there would be hiccups and miscommunication. I guess the only fear is this time the other species might actually be smarter. Wired has some <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/when-bots-teach-themselves-to-cheat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interesting real life examples</a> covered.</p> <blockquote> <p>Given a clear goal, an algorithm can master complex tasks, such as beating a world champion at Go. But even with logical parameters, it turns out that mathematical optimization empowers bots to develop shortcuts humans didn&#x2019;t think to deem off-&#xAD;limits. Teach a learning algorithm to fish, and it might just drain the lake.</p> </blockquote> <p>2. I had no idea there were multiple theories for the reason behind Dinosaurs&#x2019; extinction. I always believed the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>a fairy tale:<span class=\"push-single\"></span> <span class=\"pull-single\">&#x2018;</span>Big rock from sky hits the dinosaurs, and boom they go.&#x2019;&#x201D; Well, that may not be the case. Bianca Bosker <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/09/dinosaur-extinction-debate/565769/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has a fascinating coverage</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Before the asteroid hypothesis took hold, researchers had proposed other, similarly bizarre explanations for the dinosaurs&#x2019; demise: gluttony, protracted food poisoning, terminal chastity, acute stupidity, even Paleo-weltschmerz&#x2014;death by boredom. These theories fell by the wayside when, in 1980, the Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning physicist Luis Alvarez and three colleagues from <span class=\"small-caps\">UC</span> Berkeley announced a discovery in the journal Science</p> </blockquote> <p>3. Being ethical is not black and white. It is almost impossible to lead a life which you claim has been ethical and to make everyone agree. However,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>figuring out how to live the good life is fun&#x201D; - <a href=\"https://qz.com/1327804/its-impossible-to-lead-a-totally-ethical-life-but-its-fun-to-try/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a great essay</a> by Ephrat Livni.</p> <blockquote> <p>By virtue of accidents of birth, we find ourselves unfairly profiting from all kinds of inequalities, depending on where we are born, who our parents are, our racial or ethnic backgrounds, and more. Your passport determines more than just access&#x2014;it means you are the beneficiary, albeit abstractly, of actions you may not approve. Most of us, wherever we live, are funding wars or policies we disagree with. We can&#x2019;t help but do wrong.</p> </blockquote> <p>4. A <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/claudiakoerner/people-are-donating-millions-of-frequent-flyer-miles-to\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">much-needed account</a> from a non-profit group<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>that reunites refugees around the world with families&#x201D;. Another reminder that we humans have heart beating incessantly within. Some may have painted it black, but as a species, we will keep fighting back.</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>While hundreds of families separated at the US&#x2013;Mexico border under the Trump administration&#x2019;s&#x201D;zero tolerance&#x201D; policy remain apart, a Michigan woman has inspired people to help reunite loved ones by donating their frequent flyer miles.&#x201D;</p> </blockquote>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Dave Winer wrote few of <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/08/09/141354.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">his thoughts</a> on how the search engines need to improve with time. He was focused a bit on how it can make blogging valuable. However he also had a underlying criticism for current search engines, mainly Google.</p> <blockquote> <p>Sorry Google, your search engine is showing serious signs of age and boredom. We can do so much better. (&#x2026;) It&#x2019;s (<em>Google</em>) been stagnant for too long. They clearly need some competition.</p> </blockquote> <p>I think it&#x2019;s high time the way search results are presented to the user had some rethinking and redesigning exercise done. Search for anything and it is still a list of links (or an <span class=\"small-caps\">AMP</span> carousel when it fits your business needs) even after more than 15 years since it was introduced. I do not think there is anyone who ever paginates to the third page of search results. I would bet more than 90% don&#x2019;t even go to the second page.</p> <p>I believe when people search for something they have a fair idea of what they are looking for. Search engines need to be smart in understanding if the user is searching for a place on the web or a general query around concepts. If it is the former, it should present every data it has about that place, in a manner that&#xA0; easy to grasp. Dave&#x2019;s list already has some good ideas. Give as much context as there is out there.</p> <p>For later, it is important to focus on credibility and transparency. For example when a query is on some technical concept, it is good to show the discussions on Stack Overflow. In addition, it would be good to also show the articles that were referenced from those discussions separately. Don&#x2019;t go along sweeping the web for all the key words. Without credible shares, it hardly matters and just gets exploited. Someone sharing it while discussions attaches a credibility factor to it.</p> <p>Google&#x2019;s attempt with Knowledge panel is good. But I believe it needs to be more transparent in communicating why it is displaying what it is displaying there.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I am reading a lot of views these days from people I respect deciding to leave Twitter. And this is after a similar exodus from Facebook pretty recently.</p> <p>But this time it looks to be different; for one they are putting too much effort with their Twitter profiles. They are deleting their tweets, resetting their profile information to convey that they are not<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>here&#x201D; and resolving to not posting on Twitter again. Well, some are even ready to pay some shady<a href=\"#footnote-1BYR\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-1BYR\"><sup>1</sup></a> services to get the tweets deleted.</p> <p><a href=\"http://inessential.com/2018/08/08/the_public_square\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brent Simmons did it</a>. Matt Haughey <a href=\"https://a.wholelottanothing.org/2018/08/08/im-done-with-twitter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">followed a similar approach</a>. And there are many more people doing the same.</p> <p>I, on the other hand, was just reading through the articles and sitting there wondering what&#x2019;s different this time. I was looking for that one argument to not simply delete the account. Quit Twitter completely. Best I could get was from Matt.</p> <blockquote> <p>I&#x2019;ll continue to read twitter occasionally, and I might keep on liking tweets, but I&#x2019;m not going to send another tweet until the service changes or the management changes in very drastic ways.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, if you are still not exiting Twitter, how&#x2019;s it helping? I am afraid the place will only become messier with all the respectable voices leaving the platform.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s like being part of a coffee club that used to meet often in a coffee house of the group&#x2019;s choice. Each one of the group would talk and discuss on varied topics. It was a fun place where you could learn so much. And get to know of so many new things and news all around the world.</p> <p>But slowly the coffee house became louder, with some hateful voices propagating their distasteful views. You look to the owner of the place and hope that he doesn&#x2019;t be <em>a jack</em> and acts; you hope he asks these people to leave. And block them from coming to this place ever and ruining the experience of many such clubs as yours. But when you realise that the owner isn&#x2019;t going to do so, you decide <em>you</em> need to act. So you decide to take your group and discussion to a better, saner place.</p> <p>The question to ponder at then is would you still visit the old coffee house daily and see what&#x2019;s being discussed and voiced and promulgated?</p> <section class=\"footnotes\"> <hr /> <ol> <li id=\"footnote-1BYR\"><p>Why shady? Well you need to give them tweets and access to your profile. And some apparently post to your profile saying you use their service.

No longer must researchers comb through endless indices and catalogues to find what they are looking for.</p> <p>In spite of its tremendous improvements on what came before, however, the Web is frankly a disappointment in comparison to what it could be. Most saddening, perhaps, is the way in which the Web constrains the use of links. For example: although the link is the primary form of reference on the Web, underpinning the tangle of connections that make the system so useful, the ability to create new links is a privilege granted only to content producers. The vast majority of those interested in a piece of work are merely readers, unable to contribute, only to consume.</p> </blockquote> <p>Even though a bit unrealistic, this work by Joe Savage around open hypermedia is a fascinating exploration of what happens when you take link-based web systems outside of the web browsers. The possibilities are endless as it opens up a completely new paradigm to hyper linking&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;this takes it across all apps.</p> <p>And therein lies the biggest friction for this concept. Expecting every app to support this is too much to ask from the developers who are already running thin meeting the changing expectations of the primary platform they are built for.</p> <p>The simple goal of bringing annotations to the web (which should address some of the concerns the open hypermedia attempts to handle) itself has been attempted so many times, but has failed to stick.</p> <p>Anyway, for the research community, the prototype system as demonstrated below should work wonders. And they might welcome this.

And I am happy that the system worked well. Added satisfaction was provided by the community by expressing interest and openness to try the endpoint out.</p> As I had mentioned in that post, handling &#x201C;the creation of like and reply post types&#x201D; was next on the list. I just couldn&#x2019;t live with the fact that the endpoint didn&#x2019;t handle these simple post types. So, it had to be addressed. And it is addressed now &#x2014; <note> the latest version of blotpub handles replies and like posts. </note> <p>The information is added as properties <code>in-reply-to</code> and <code>like-of</code> to the post metadata.</p> In addition, <note> support has been added to explicitly place the date property as part of the metadata. </note> <p>Earlier, file creation date was used as the post date. The enhancement was discussed with <a href=\"https://micro.blog/jack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@jack</a> as part of this <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/blotpub/issues/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">git issue</a>. With this version, if the published date is provided, it would be set in the metadata. Else date-time for post creation request would be used. To enable this, just set <code>SET_DATE</code> environment variable to <code>true</code>. Additionally, you can also set the <code>TZ</code> variable to override default timezones for the server hosting your endpoint. Refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/blotpub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>README</code></a> for more details.</p> <p>I have also fixed some minor issues in handling the post creation via different clients, mainly Micro.blog iOS client.</p> <p><strong><em>What&#x2019;s next?</em></strong> Handling of image files.</p>\n",

So here I am jotting down the things I will have to sort out before the switch. This would be a rolling list.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>Moving all the old posts to Blot. This should primarily involve handling of metadata. Hugo frontmatter needs to be converted to something that Blot can parse. Tricky part is going to be around dates and tags.</li> <li>Handling of redirecting journal posts. Currently they are available at <code>/journal/&lt;postname&gt;</code>. This will have to redirected to <code>/&lt;postname&gt;</code>.</li> <li>Handling of redirecting <code>lab.</code> urls. All the current blot posts will move to <code>www</code> subdomain.</li> <li>Handling of Blot images redirect or modification of the posts.</li> <li>Moving of the <code>/now</code> and <code>/about</code> pages to blot.</li> </ol> <p>As I jot this down, there is another option that looks simpler (and so more probable).</p> <p>Blot becomes my blog, replaces journal on the current site. Hugo site remains my main site. I will not move any posts, journals or pages. Everything in the old site remains in the old site. All the formatting rework is avoided.</p> <p>I can move the complete journal section to an archive link in the footer. Blot will be serving <code>/blog</code>. <code>/lab</code> will be redirected.</p> <p>Main site navigations will be Home | Arcticles | Blog | Now | About</p> <p>That means the current site will keep serving my long form posts, the articles. Ones for which I spend significant time, I have a machine available to write over the days. And I can control the publish process. The blot blog will sever my thoughts, ones that I need to quickly put out, may be mostly while mobile.</p>\n",

Well, I am still on the journey of indiewebifying this place. I still post to my site using other apps, mainly Quill and Micro.blog. Until I get the micropub endpoint that I am working on done, I will keep this place booked for my excursions, my experiments.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, I finally managed to get a basic version of one worked out. Basic, but a workable version. Introducing <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/blotpub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blotpub</a>.</p> <p>It is a self-hosteable Micropub endpoint for blot.im and Dropbox. It accepts Micropub requests, creates a simple Blot posts and saves them to a configured Dropbox folder. This enables updating a Blot blog through a Micropub client.</p> <p>I have tested creation of both long and short posts via <a href=\"https://quill.p3k.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quill</a>. It supports creation of posts with or without titles. For me, the former are my micro posts while later are more of the long form articles.</p> <p>It also supports metadata creation for tags and slugs as part of the post documents.</p> <p>With this, I have my basic needs covered. Most of the time, I am posting text posts; the current version should be able to handle that.</p> <p>Next, I need to handle the creation of like and reply post types and also handle the image files. It may so happen that I end up getting these done soon. However, I wanted to put the bare bones version out there.</p> <h3 id=\"how-do-i-use-this\">How do I use this?</h3> <p>Well, as I said earlier the <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/blotpub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">source is open</a>. It is a Node application which you can self-host as your own micropub endpoint. I have covered some of the details as part of the project <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/blotpub/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">readme</a>.</p> <p>However, before you use blotpub, there is one essential step from IndieWeb that needs to be addressed - to make your website your identity online. It involves declaring openly your social network profiles as rel-me links and link those profiles back to your site. This allows you to login to any IndieAuth enabled services using your website&#x2019;s homepage - no need to create an account or maintain passwords.</p> <p>You can refer to the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Essential IndiWeb&#x201D; section in <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/display-webmentions/#essential-indieweb\">this post on how to display webmentions</a> on your site. That step applies to using a micropub too.</p> <div class=\"note\"> This is an <strong>early alpha release</strong> of the application. Things may be a bit unstable. Please use it with caution. Also, I will continue to work on this and improve it, so, you may have to refresh your deployment regularly. However, I would be happy if you choose to join me on this bumpy ride - this will only get better with more people using it. </div> <ol type=\"1\"> <li><p><strong>Install</strong>: Just install this as a normal Node.js application. A better way would be to <a href=\"https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/am1t/blotpub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deploy directly to Heroku</a>.</p></li> <li><strong>Grant Dropbox Access</strong>: Generate a <a href=\"https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2014/05/generate-an-access-token-for-your-own-account/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dropbox access token</a> from the Dropbox <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Console</a> to grant the application access to your Dropbox folder. Just create a new app in the console, chose <span class=\"small-caps\">API</span> as Dropbox <span class=\"small-caps\">API</span>, select the type of access as<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Full Dropbox&#x201D; and finally, name your application. You will need this generated token while configuring your application. <note> Just to reiterate the point, the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Permission type&#x201D; for the app that you create for blotpub in dropbox needs to be set to<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Full Dropbox&#x201D; </note></li> <li><p><strong>Configure</strong>: Add the required configuration values via environment variables or the Heroku app deploy dashboard. You will need the token generated above.</p></li> <li><strong>Endpoint Discovery</strong>: Once you have deployed the application, your Micropub endpoint will be available at <code>/micropub</code> (e.g. <code>https://deployed-blotpub-app.com/micropub</code>). <note> Note that the endpoint url is different from your website url. It would be the url for the blotpub application that your installed in the 1st step. </note> <p>For Heroku deployment, it would be something like <code>https://*****.herokuapp.com/micropub</code> (exact url will be available at Heroku dashboard). To enable automatic discovery for your <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/micropub#Endpoint_Discovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Micropub endpoint</a> and <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/obtaining-an-access-token#Discovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">token endpoint</a>, you will need to add the following values to your Blot site&#x2019;s <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> - usually available in the <code>head.html</code> file in your theme/template.</p></li> </ol> <pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;micropub&quot; href=&quot;https://deployed-blotpub-app.com/micropub&quot;&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;token_endpoint&quot; href=&quot;https://tokens.indieauth.com/token&quot;&gt;</code></pre> <ol start=\"5\" type=\"1\"> <li><p><strong>Media Endpoint:</strong> Most of the micropub clients, like quill, can send the media files as <code>multipart</code> data. So, you can attach image while creating a new post. However, some clients like Micro.blog require a <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/micropub_media_endpoint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Media Endpoint</a> to handle the media files (primarily the image files). Blotpub comes with an inbuilt media endpoint. To use it, just configure the <code>MEDIA_ENDPOINT</code> variable in your blotpub deployment to <code>https://deployed-blotpub-app.com/micropub/media</code> (for Heroku, something like <code>https://*****.herokuapp.com/micropub/media</code>). This will allow you to post image from such clients too.</p></li> <li><p>Note that file uploads via blotpub media endpoint will only add the image file at the location configured at <code>PHOTO_PATH</code> and the <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span> to the image will be added to the post metadata as <code>photo: &lt;url-to-image&gt;</code>. To render this in the post, you can add the below code block in <code>entries.html</code> and <code>entry.html</code> in your Blot theme either before or after <code>{{{html}}}</code> as per your preference.</p></li> </ol> <pre><code>{{#metadata.photo} } &lt;img src=&quot;{{metadata.photo} }&quot;&gt; {{/metadata.photo} }</code></pre> <p>You should now be able to post to your Blot site from external Micropub clients (like Micro.blog iOS App, Quill etc). If you do use this, ping me. All your feedback is welcome.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I have observed that I have been more inclined recently to post on Blot blog. I do have <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my main website</a> which I have been using for all things long and short. But there is some lure of the simplicity of this place. You write. You save. And the post is up.</p> <p>No committing a post to a remote repository, waiting then for the engine to trigger a build. No frantic refreshes to check if the post is up. It&#x2019;s simple.</p> <p>But every time I saw my published post here, I was left cringing at how awful the interface around was. I wish I could purely focus on the content and the process. But unfortunately I am wired a bit odd. I tend to focus on the design around first; if that sucks, I can&#x2019;t move on<a href=\"#footnote-14SL\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-14SL\"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p> <p>So I had to take a pause today. If I was going to post more here, the place had to be cleaner.</p> <p>And given that I already had my <a href=\"http://github.com/am1t/blot-musings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">custom theme</a> up, I got down to work. I refreshed the theme and made it all about content<a href=\"#footnote-24SL\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-24SL\"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p> <p>No navigation items or links to other places - a link opens the content. And in just the way I like it.</p> <p>No homepage summarising the place - <code>/home</code> opens the stream of my posts.</p> <p>No distinguishing posts by type - all posts are equal<a href=\"#footnote-34SL\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-34SL\"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p> <p>For now, I am happy with this design. At least, I won&#x2019;t cringe when I open my own posts.</p> <p>Why not make this the primary homepage? Well, I am still on the journey of <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/indiewebify-blot-site\">indiewebifying this place</a>. I still post to my site using other apps, mainly <a href=\"http://quill.p3k.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quill</a> and <a href=\"https://micro.blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Micro.blog</a>. Until I get the micropub endpoint that I am <a href=\"https://lab.amitgawande.com/micropub-endpoint-from-the-ground-up\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">working on</a> done, I will keep this place booked for my excursions, my experiments.</p> <section class=\"footnotes\"> <hr /> <ol> <li id=\"footnote-14SL\"><p>This is a costly habit.

This is how the homepage looked.</p> <p><img src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/b264047f03.jpg\" alt=\"techmeme ads\"></p> <p>And this how they introduced the prominent change visible out there.</p> <blockquote> <p>Today, Techmeme is introducing ads that are automatically placed under stories matching news topics that an advertiser wants to target. They&#x2019;re a great way to associate your brand with a specific category of technology products, or even to challenge individual companies.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>For instance, Yelp is now advertising against news about Google, to urge the search giant to<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Focus on the User&#x201D;.</p> </blockquote> <p>To be frank, I don&#x2019;t like this. Contextual advertising is overrated; it is prone to be misused by brands with power. Can a small upcoming player overcome an onslaught from the incumbents? It may be factual, but can be projected in an overly aggressive fashion.</p> <p>Anyway, I think the wonderful folks behind Techmeme are aware of the possible fallouts. And they believe they have the process to avoid that.</p> <blockquote> <p>Of course, there are limits to the sorts of messages we&#x2019;ll place. We&#x2019;ll decline to feature offensive or overly gimmicky ad copy. And we won&#x2019;t include negative ad messages aimed at current advertisers, in effect, guaranteeing a form of competitive separation.</p> </blockquote> <p>With the scale and scope of Techmeme, this might work, this might be enough. But I still believe it better not get into the muddy waters of contextual ads.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I recently received a great feedback and a query from <a href=\"https://micro.blog/cygnoir\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@cygnoir</a> at Micro.blog.</p> <blockquote> <p>The links you share are so interesting! I especially love that you give a bit of an excerpt. Are you auto-posting these somehow? If so, would you be willing to teach me (or point me in the right direction to learn)?</p> </blockquote> <p>Yes, I do read a lot of articles on web and share each one I like. And the reason I share them is I want others to read them too. I think it is difficult to convince people just with a title. So I also include an excerpt from the post that may give the readers an idea what the post is about (<a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/journal/40488/\">sample</a>)</p> <p>For me this usually happens while am on mobile and so it is just isn&#x2019;t simple to copy and paste. So I have a system worked out on iOS with iA Writer and Workflow apps that allows me to easily post the links with excerpt.</p> <p>It starts with a template in iA Writer with placeholders for all the relevant sections - date, title, link and content that is to be shared.</p> <pre><code>--- title : &#x201C;&#x201D; date : {date} --- &#x2605; Liked &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;{link}&quot; class=&quot;u-like-of&quot; rel=&quot;like-of&quot;&gt;{title}&lt;/a&gt;&quot; &gt; {content}</code></pre> <p>I then have a Workflow which prepares the actual file with this template. I trigger this Workflow from Safari as Action Extension, which runs through the below process.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>Gets the current <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span> and puts it into a variable <code>link</code>.</li> <li>Gets the title of the current page and puts it into a variable <code>title</code>.</li> <li>Gets the contents of clipboard and sets it variable <code>content</code>.</li> <li>Gets the current <code>date</code> in required format.</li> <li>Picks up the above template and replaces appropriate placeholders with the actual values fetched earlier.</li> <li>Creates a new markdown file with this content and opens it in iA Writer for further processing. And publish.</li> </ol> <p>This system, though not perfect, works for me currently. I want to simplify it further - mainly using Micropub endpoint. But haven&#x2019;t got a chance to implement that yet. Till then, I am going to use this one.</p> <p>I have similar template and Workflow combinations for reply, image, link posts.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I hate podcasts, because the medium is demanding. It demands so much time from me, demands focused attention to follow along. I wish I didn&#x2019;t find them so damn useful to keep giving in to the medium&#x2019;s demands.</p> <p>But to do so, I have to alter my regular habits to accommodate podcasts in the daily routine. Time that was consumed by music for majority part of my life is taken over by podcasts now. If I have even a minute free, earphones are plugged and I continue what I was listening to. There are times when I question whether the medium actually deserves so much of attention from me.</p> <p>So every now and then I look and relook at my subscribed podcasts list to decide which podcasts earn their place. I relook at my habits to see what I can change to make this manageable.</p> <ul> <li>If there is a podcast which I hardly listen to, it&#x2019;s unsubscribed.</li> <li>If there is one whose last episodes I hardly remember, it&#x2019;s unsubscribed.</li> <li>I rarely stay subscribed to podcasts that might talk about the same sets of topics (that means very few tech podcasts).</li> <li>I do not want news from the podcasts, I want views, perspectives.</li> <li>None with daily episodes. Rather I prefer podcasts that are spread across the week. So if I find that there are multiple (more than 3) podcasts delivering episodes on the same day, few are simply unsubscribed.</li> <li>I always listen at 1.2x speed.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Trim Silence&#x201D; mode is always on in PocketCasts. I do not care of the lost fidelity. I recently tried to let the silence stay on and I felt everyone was deliberately being a slow speaker.</li> <li>There is a big reason I use PocketCasts. Overcast is a loved app amongst the tech community and I tried hard to use it. But it just doesn&#x2019;t respect data usages limits. It either allows to download all episodes every time or not notify about a new episode at all. I, on the other hand, want to look at the episode, read what it&#x2019;s about and then decide whether to download. PocketCasts&#x2019; a lot more flexible.</li> <li>I like if the podcasts, especially long ones, do chapters. It&#x2019;s easier to skip over the topics I just have no interests in.</li> <li>I listen to ad reads if they aren&#x2019;t robotic, if the host believes in the product. That&#x2019;s least I can do to contribute for their efforts.</li> </ul>\n",

[&#x2026;] Like many well-meaning but misguided baby boomers, neither of my parents received an elite education but they nevertheless believed that an expensive school was not a materialistic waste of money; it was the key to a better life than the one they had. They continued to put faith in this falsehood even after a previously unimaginable financial loss, and so we continued spending money that we didn&#x2019;t have&#x2014;money that banks kept giving to us.</p> </blockquote> <p>May be a devisive opinion, but student loan debt is a curse on our society. A person shouldn&#x2019;t be indebted in attempt to kick start his life.</p> <p>Throughout my whole life (one I controlled), I have attempted to not be under any sort of unavoidable debt.

The foundational myth of an entire generation of Americans was the false promise that education was priceless&#x2014;that its value was above or beyond its cost. College was not a right or a privilege but an inevitability on the way to a meaningful adulthood. What an irony that the decisions I made about college when I was seventeen have derailed such a goal.</p> </blockquote> <p>Perfect!</p>\n",

So what&#x2019;s this film about? Every thinking mind has his own answer.</p> <blockquote> <p>And yet it&#x2019;s hard to look at this movie, made at a time of violent divisiveness in the country over issues of surveillance, of complicity, of violence born of fear, and not see a snapshot of a society &#x2014; not Gotham&#x2019;s fictional one, but our own, real-life one &#x2014; ready to plunge into the abyss of fragmentation, of self-serving chaos. Maybe that&#x2019;s why Nolan&#x2019;s film now feels so poignant. Today, it&#x2019;s hard not to feel that humanity&#x2019;s worst impulses have won, that those without conscience or shame were allowed to sow endless dissension, hatred, and cruelty, using our own sense of guilt against us.</p> </blockquote>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>So, in one of the <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/indiewebify-blot-site\">recent posts</a> on indiewebifying the blot.im site, I was faced with a roadblock.</p> <blockquote> <p>I could not find any way to format the published date that gets displayed on the posts. The post properties exposes just&#xA0;, which gets the default format of <span class=\"small-caps\">MMM</span> <span class=\"small-caps\">DD</span>, <span class=\"small-caps\">YYYY</span>. And I do not think it&#x2019;s a valid ISO-8601 as expected by the microformats2.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, I had reached out to David and apparently there is a <em>yet-to-be-documented</em> way.</p> <p>As per the <a href=\"https://blot.im/developers/reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official document</a> for developers, the standard way to get the post&#x2019;s publish date is with property <code>{ { date } }</code><a href=\"#footnote-1HH2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-1HH2\"><sup>1</sup></a>. However, if so inserted, it inserts the date in a default format - <code>MMMM DD, YYYY</code>. Even though it is a format that displays well, it does not provide the complete information on date, up to time level. For the microformats2 <code>dt-published</code> <code>time</code> tag, it is important that the post publish date is inserted as valid ISO-8601. So to do that, just use the below code snippet instead of <code>{ { date } }</code>.</p> <pre><code>{ { # entry } } { { # formatDate } } MM YYYY DD { { /formatDate } } ... { { / entry } }</code></pre> <p>Make sure you remove spaces in between the curly brackets (<em>refer footnote 1</em>). Wherever the snippet <code>{ { # | / formatDate } }</code> is added, it would be replaced by post&#x2019;s publish date in the format defined in between the tags.</p> <p>In David&#x2019;s own words,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>any of <a href=\"https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moment.js&#x2019; date formatting tokens</a> work (formatDate is basically <a href=\"https://momentjs.com/docs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moment.js</a> behind the scenes)&#x201D;. So you should be able to customise it completely as per your need.</p> <section class=\"footnotes\"> <hr /> <ol> <li id=\"footnote-1HH2\"><p>As clarified by David in an earlier <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/blot-open-questions-update\">open queries post</a>, there is at this point no way to escape the parsing of the code references for properties that Blot uses. It ends up replacing them with the value. So adding spaces is my way to work around that limitation at this point.<a href=\"#ref-1HH2\" class=\"footnote-back\">&#x21A9;</a></p></li> </ol> </section>\n",

Given that I already have my primary site active, how can I include <code>rel=me</code> links point to any of the Twitter/Github services? Concern is primary as I cannot link my Twitter/Github profiles to multiple homepage.

I receive and display all the interactions on the posts from different platforms using webmentions.</p> <p>I make Hugo process and render such microposts differently. It&#x2019;s custom now, and may follow any solution in future. But the intention would be my microposts would exist here.</p> <p>This structure has also lent me the flexibility of the posting interface. My posts, social and long ones, originate from the app that&#x2019;s convenient and relevant at the time of posting. Some originate at Micro.blog iOS app, some at <a href=\"https://quill.p3k.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quill</a>, most replies and likes directly from Microsub clients (like this one from Monocle) and at times in text editor of my choice (iA Writer, Drafts). And that in itself is a huge benefit.</p> <p>I like ring of<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span><em>social</em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span> subdomain that Dan uses, especially for the reason that it can always act as the destination for my microposts, irrespective of what hosts them. I may explore that.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I had <a href=\"https://lab.amitgawande.com/update-on-micro-threads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recently started</a> working on updating Micro.threads application to focus on discovery, specifically user discovery. My social interactions on the internet have never been dull or frustrated since I joined Micro.blog. And it can largely be attributed to the extremely fine community of users that exists on the platform.</p> <p>However, I had also realised that there were a lot many threads, many interactions that I was missing on, because finding new users was still not easy. Discover section exists, but it helped primarily to get new, interesting posts. There was a major section of the platform which could assist me to ease this problem. And that is people I follow and their posts in my stream.</p> <p>Manton had <a href=\"http://www.manton.org/2018/07/12/following-users-ui.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recently updated</a> the default behaviour of a user profile&#x2019;s<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Following&#x201D; section to display only<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span><em>a list of who someone is following that you aren&#x2019;t following already</em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span>. That itself is a huge improvement in identifying new users. But, for me, that too was a bit troublesome. I wanted to focus not just on the follow status, but the interactions; not just focus on whom someone I already follow, follows, but rather whom they interact with frequently.</p> <p>So it was only just to build a system, first of all for myself that will discover more amazing users that I can follow, that I can interact with and learn from. And so I did.</p> <p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/_img/user-discovery-microthreads.png\" alt=\"Micro.threads User Discovery\"></p> <p>I have been playing around with the user discovery section of Micro.threads. And I think it will help others too. Just <a href=\"http://microthreads.amitg.xyz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">head over</a> to the Micro.threads -&gt; Discover section and give the application a try. You may find it helpful. You may not. But I think the feedback you share would be useful for me, and hopefully to the community too.</p> <p>I believe this just acts as a placeholder until such discovery features are available in the official app itself. Till then, this would be a playground to identify more ways to discover interesting profiles and threads on Micro.blog.</p> <hr /> <p>I have made some key considerations at this point while developing and rolling this out.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>You will have to sign in with your Micro.blog user id and an app token, which is discarded the moment you log out. I have no intention to maintain any accounts or credentials. I plan to use the <code>/account/signin</code> <span class=\"small-caps\">API</span> from micro.blog in future; for now, app token is the quickest, officially supported way to get going.</li> <li>I haven&#x2019;t optimised the performance of discover algorithm to the fullest. I plan to get that done that gradually.</li> <li>I am inclined to keep the information shown itself improving, and also add more ways to unearth user profiles and threads.This is just a first version that I was satisfied with and could roll out. I am already working on the threads parsing and discovery which I think will get done this weekend itself.</li> <li>I do not think I can get this perfect or can stay focused without the feedback from you all. So, any and every feedback is welcome.</li> </ol>\n",

				"title": "State of Microsub Servers and Client",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I had recently <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/journal/39619/\">expressed</a> an excited opinion on Microsub, the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>new&#x201D; Indieweb spec. I could then see the potential of the standard and also the available solutions, the server and the clients, around it.</p> <blockquote> <p>I have seen Monocle in action now and realise the power of Microsub standard. I do not think I can read feeds in any other manner now. This is fantastic!</p> </blockquote> <p>The fact that there exists a hosted Microsub server in Aperture is a great start, it has given a chance to many to get started knowing the standard early. And I know people like Aaron Parecki <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/2018/03/12/17/building-an-indieweb-reader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">are hard at work</a> to continue improving the clients like Monocle. However, I think my excitement was premature.</p> <p>No doubt, the core technology behind Microsub is solid and it can eventually redefine the way feeds are subscribed to and consumed. And bundled with Micropub to post actions of the type <em>like</em>, <em>reply</em>, <em>repost</em> directly to your website right from your reading view makes it absolutely magical.</p> <p>So I don&#x2019;t blame myself that I got excited about the standard seeing the potential of what can be achieved when all these Indieweb standards work seamlessly together. <em>Seamless</em> is the key though. For the last few days, I have been trying to use Monocle as my primary feed reader. Unfortunately, the whole system has some way to go before I actually can. I am just noting down the frustrations I encountered using the system.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>Keeping the read status of the posts in sync is flaky. Many of the posts I have read already are shown again. Some of the posts that should have already popped up are not available for some time. When they finally are, they are available in bulk. If I understand the standard correctly, it is the server at fault here. And it is only a single client involved at this point.</li> <li>Subscribing to feeds with the server is not easy. Not user experience wise, but again in terms of the unreliability of the posts appearing in the stream. At times, there are 0 posts fetched; at other times, there is a bulk of hundreds of posts. It poses a challenge for the client.</li> <li>And to the client. I think we can learn from the available feed readers and focus on the must-have features - which are primarily around showing available posts. Monocle currently cannot be configured to show only the new posts. Filter options are limited. Sorting options are limited. Marking read/unread is unavailable. Subscribing to new feeds is not possible (even though spec has a <code>follow</code> <span class=\"small-caps\">API</span> which I hope Aperture exposes). Few of these might be nitpicking, but they are important when the reference for most new users would be existing feed readers.</li> <li>The concept of Microsub server and client, former for maintaining the feeds and the later for displaying them, sounds great. However, to get people on board, we will need at least one application that does the job of both. Wish Monocle and Aperture were two components of a single application.</li> </ol> <p>I know the standard is still a work in progress, especially the server and client applications. So no doubt there would be some kinks in the working. The intention of this post is in no way to demean the people involved or pinpoint at the failures. My intention is to capture my thoughts on why, even though I want to, I cannot yet use the current applications in place. The standard is making significant headway and I hope I would soon be able to benefit from the system. As Aaron says in his introductory post I referenced above -</p> <blockquote> <p>My goal with this is to use this as my primary online dashboard to follow all kinds of content, as well as being able to interact with the content without leaving the interface.</p> </blockquote> <p>Amen to that. Unfortunately, now is not the right time. So I <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/journal/40523/\">am back</a> to my search for that perfect feed reading service.</p>\n",

				"title": "Update on Micro.threads",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I had recently realised the project I had much plan for wasn&#x2019;t updated since sometime back. So much that for an observer it very well looks to be<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span><a href=\"https://m.b.wiki.eli.li\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">potentially defunct</a><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span>. There are many reasons why I couldn&#x2019;t push regular updates to this. Priorities at home and at work just didn&#x2019;t allow me enough time.</p> <p>However, deep down I knew I just wasn&#x2019;t satisfied with what I had achieved. I had a huge list of things that I needed to implement and the effort required I thought was huge. But I just couldn&#x2019;t look at the stagnant progress of this service. I found it useful at multiple times and I know it can be improved so that others do too. So, I have decided to take up the project, small improvements at a time.</p> <p>To start with, all the threads, mainly from posts featured in discover section and Emoji collections, are up to date. Well, <a href=\"https://micro.blog/manton\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@manton</a><span class=\"push-single\"></span><span class=\"pull-single\">&#x2019;</span>s hard at work and <a href=\"http://www.manton.org/2018/07/06/144546.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has already grown</a> the list of Emoji collections. Well, <em>all the Emoji Collections from Micro.blog <a href=\"http://amitg.xyz/micro/threads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">are available</a> at Micro.threads now</em>. So I (and others) can now get all the recommendations for that one <span class=\"small-caps\">&#x1F355;</span> parlour or one&#x2019;s &#x1F5FA;&#xFE0F;ogue.</p> <p>But there&#x2019;s more. The huge list of limitations I talked about at the top? Yeah, I have decided to start addressing them small updates at a time. Firstly just by noting them down.</p> <ul> <li>Threads concept itself is limited. Currently it takes a post id, fetches the conversation (thread) and then pull out all the links and only show these links as a thread.</li> <li>Creating thread is a mess and so is updating it.</li> <li>No way for external users to generate threads. Keeping threads updated is a chore at this point.</li> </ul> <p>So, I have been back to drawing board, working on the ways I want to address these and present what I have in mind. I have a clear objective with this service. What&#x2019;s to come has already found its place on <a href=\"http://www.amitg.xyz/micro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the homepage</a>, just as a placeholder for now. I wish I manage to deliver it to my satisfaction, first and fore most. If along the way, it helps the community, well and good.</p> <p>Back to work.</p>\n",

Till now, I have been using <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/webpage-micropub-to-github/tree/musings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a custom fork</a> of a endpoint from <a href=\"https://github.com/voxpelli\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pelle Wessman</a> for my Hugo site. It has served me well.</p> <p>However, I always wished if I could get one written specifically for my simple needs. One that I know and understand every part of. Given that I have no endpoint yet for the blot site, this is clear opportunity to create one geared for making this site micropub enabled. Hugo site will address my <em>third-party-posting</em> needs till then. So here&#x2019;s the start. I will capture this journey, of course, here and will keep this updated with progress (<em>I hope</em>). Below are the things at this point that I need to get started.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Micropub#How_to_implement\" class=\"uri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://indieweb.org/Micropub#How_to_implement</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#introduction\" class=\"uri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#introduction</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://dropbox-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/moduledoc.html#module-dropbox.dropbox\" class=\"uri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://dropbox-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/moduledoc.html#module-dropbox.dropbox</a></li> </ul> <p>I want to explore python first as an option to get this implemented.

And of course, given how gem of a person he is, he did address all of them quickly. I am updating the original post with his responses. This dedication of David makes me love this service even more!</p> <hr /> <p>I have some questions I need to explore and find answers for some issues in using Blot. Just jotting them down for reference. The list may continuously grow and shrink as I find the answers.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>What&#x2019;s going on with <code>\\{\\{Summary\\}\\}</code>? I do not think it generates what it says it does -<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>first line&#x201D;. It ignores lines with links, it ignores codes in the line. So what&#x2019;s outputted is something inaccurate.</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p><strong>[David]</strong>: You can override summary in the metadata at the start of a file. If you know a little javascript, you can read the rules for how the summary property is generated automatically.</p> </blockquote> <ol start=\"2\" type=\"1\"> <li>Can we override the behaviour of <code>\\{\\{title\\}\\}</code>? It is especially important for title-less posts as currently, the file name gets used by default. You need to explicitly set <code>Title:</code> to blank.</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p><strong>[David]</strong>: You can also override title in the metadata. However, based on what you are trying to do, I&#x2019;d make use of the property. This refers to a markdown or <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span> title tag in the file itself. For example:</p> </blockquote> <p></p> <p></p> <ol start=\"3\" type=\"1\"> <li>Point 2 is also important for posts via just the image files. As of now, it adds the image name as the title. I would prefer not the post to have any title at all.</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p><strong>[David]</strong>: I think I have solved this point in #2, please let me know if not.</p> </blockquote> <ol start=\"4\" type=\"1\"> <li>Can we override the behaviour of <code>\\{\\{\\{body\\}\\}\\}</code>? Just want to explore possibility to modify behaviour of URLs of image sources. Currently, relative URLs to <code>blotcdn</code> without scheme are added.</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p><strong>[David]</strong>: No, it is not possible to modify body. Please can you explain what you are trying to do? Would you like Blot to stop uploading your images to blotcdn? You can disable this behaviour on the settings page under Images &gt; Cache and optimize images</p> </blockquote> <ol start=\"5\" type=\"1\"> <li>How can we make reference to any Post parameter in a post? If we include the parameter (for example , it gets converted to the title on build? Can we escape the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>?</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p><strong>[David]</strong>: This is not possible right now, it is a bug, I will fix it. Sorry!</p> </blockquote>\n",

Is it not a useful technology? Or is it the fact that the technology demoed is just too good, sound too useful to be true? I think it is the later.</p> <p>Google believes in openly demonstrating the things they are working on, the tech they are building. However, they oversell what the tech can achieve; they drumbeat the most ideal scenario without much thought to its ramifications, its pitfalls.</p> <p>John Gruber, as always, again puts it perfectly in <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/06/google_demos_duplex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">his post</a> on Google Duplex&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-qCanuYrR0g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">latest demo</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>I still think the whole thing feels like a demo of a technology (the human-like speech), not a product. Google claimed this week that Duplex currently succeeds 4 out of 5 times at placing a reservation without a human operator&#x2019;s intervention. That&#x2019;s a good batting average for a demo, but untenable for a shipping product at Google&#x2019;s scale. With a 20 percent failure rate, Google would need an army of human operators standing by all day long, to support a feature they don&#x2019;t make any money from. I&#x2019;m skeptical that this will ever be a product expanded to wide use, and if it is, it might be years away.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Right now it feels like a feature in search of a product, but they pitched it as an imminent product at I/O because it made for a stunning demo.</p> </blockquote> <p>Exactly. That completes my thought&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;it&#x2019;s the tech that Google markets. Tech, not a product, can be marketed and sold is a fallacy that Google, for some reason, continues to believe.</p>\n",

Now that&#x2019;s one juicy premise. Alas, a juicy premise is necessary, but never sufficient after all to make a compelling read.</p> <p>A widower Jane Stewart works as a manager at her ageing great-aunt and -uncle&#x2019;s storybook resort. Things go awry for her when during her planned Murder and Mayhem week, one of her guests is murdered and the book he had won as part of a scavenger hunt is missing. It is now Jane&#x2019;s responsibility - not just as the resort manager, but as a guardian to the treasure the book was part of - to find the real-killer and the missing book.</p> <p>This is such a simple plot that could very well have been penned into a riveting mystery. But it wasn&#x2019;t. I was so close to give up on this books at one moment - actually that was right at the moment it stopped being a murder mystery and veered into at attempted thriller around a treasure trove. Plot is thin. Writing is barely passable. Mystery is poorly narrated. There just isn&#x2019;t enough suspense and urgency to hold the reader&#x2019;s attention. A straight forward story, narrated in an extremely amateurish manner.</p> <p>A word on the writing first, I think the way the book started was pretty promising. Author Ellery Adams did have a nice plot at her hands. However, the way she chose to present it is so unlike a murder mystery typically is. I wasn&#x2019;t involved enough to care for anyone who was dead because the characters just weren&#x2019;t built well. Add to that, a reader was informed, told, that a person was murdered&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;never shown. For that matter, every thing that happens is <em>told</em> to the reader, not <em>shown</em>. And that&#x2019;s where lies the biggest fault of the novel.</p> <p>An inclination from the author to kick start a series by making this much bigger than a simple, cozy murder mystery didn&#x2019;t help either. All it does is introduce a string of unnecessary subplots and a meandering ending that attempts to set ground for books to come.</p> <p>A murder mystery needs a meaty plot, strong characters and succinct narration. Unfortunately, this books fails on all count for me. Jane, the protagonist, doubts at multiple points in the book if she is worthy to be the <em>guardian of a family secret</em>; wishes if she had just been a Resort Manager. I, as a reader, wished the same.</p> <p>My rating: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2417063216\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2 of 5 stars</a></p>\n",

There are too many variables I failed to think about initially.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://atp.fm/episodes/268\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">latest <span class=\"small-caps\">ATP</span> episode</a> covers few of them really well. I had to put down my thoughts to appreciate how big a deal this is.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>Transitioning the developers for the Mac is not going to be easy as-is. The lack of earnings from the macOS platform is already a cause of concern for the developers and Apple. Supporting a new chip architecture would be an overhead, irrespective of how easy Apple makes it.</li> <li>Macs are used for developing the software targeted at beyond the Apple platforms. A different chip design just adds another variable to the test-support cycle.</li> <li>It&#x2019;s easier to say Apple will only move the <em>non-pro</em> macs to in-house chips (most probably based on <span class=\"small-caps\">ARM</span> architecture) than to make an <span class=\"small-caps\">OS</span>, already loaded with bugs, to simultaneously support two chip architectures.</li> <li>In a scenario (worst case) of Apple failing to keep up with competitors on performance, will they be ready for another transition? Or are they in this for a long haul, irrespective of what the competition delivers?</li> <li>There is a possibility of the chip design team running low on bandwidth if they are to support two platforms. This can, of course, mean that there won&#x2019;t be deserved attention to the iOS platform &#x2014; the money-earner, hence the more important platform for Apple. Eventually, Mac will get ignored (again!). Another possibility, of course, is Apple just doesn&#x2019;t see two platforms existing simultaneously in its future. And hence the next point.</li> <li>I do not think it is just a coincidence that this rumour is going hand in hand with another rumour around <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Project Marzipan</a>. I believe there is some close relationship between the two - either as a strategy or as an enabler.</li> </ol> <p>Whatever the truth behind the rumours be, upcoming <span class=\"small-caps\">WWDC</span> promises to be an exciting event. Even if they do not chalk out the whole strategy, would be interesting if we do see any early signs.</p>\n",

But when a reader reasonably would want to know more about the subject, the Rule of Links says you should link to it.</p> </blockquote> <p>It has to be the word that makes the reader curious with any of the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5 Ws</a> on the topic. But something that is always pestering me at the back of my mind is what does this link communicate to the search engines. Isn&#x2019;t this link also one of the signals for Google to decide what the outgoing link (the page) is about?</p> <p>So I believe the first link of this post is correct as per Dave&#x2019;s rules of links. However, I don&#x2019;t think that helps a search engine understand the linked page better.</p> <p>It won&#x2019;t be a stretch to think Dave believes a writer shouldn&#x2019;t worry how a search engine reads a post. But given the reality of today&#x2019;s web, one just cannot ignore how a search engine sees your page.</p> <p>Also, I am a bit torn on the below perspective.</p> <blockquote> <p>In the Web, after having visited a link, you can just hit the Back button to regain your context. (An aside, that&#x2019;s why links that open in new windows are non-web-like.)</p> </blockquote> <p>On this site, I do adhere to this principle for all the regular posts. However, for link-posts, I do open the post linked from the title in a new window. I do not create such posts just to share the link &#x2014; for that, I would, well, just share the link on whichever platform. I generally have some comment to make on the post or the section of the post.</p> <p>So in such cases, I assume the reader visiting my site wants to read my commentary. And I do not want to lose her attention by forcing her out to the linked post. If she has already read the post, great. If she hasn&#x2019;t, she can do so in a new tab and then come back to the commentary.</p> <p>Is it really appropriate to open a new tab on a reader&#x2019;s machine just to not lose that reader? No.&#xA0;Shouldn&#x2019;t I trust my writing to pull the reader back even if she gets redirected? Of course, yes. However, given our diminishing attention span amid the growing distracting portals all around, how practical is it to assume she will be back?</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I had <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/indiewebify-hugo-website/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recently expressed</a> my hope for more people to own their identities online.</p> <blockquote> <p>There is nothing wrong with attempting to control what you post online, to make sure it stays online till you want it to. I do also realise that it is naive to think no one getting online will find this process irksome. Even though well defined, the (<em>open web</em>) principles are not for all. The simplicity of using and posting on social media services will continue to attract regular users. However, here&#x2019;s wishing that at least a part of these users are inspired to get their own personal domain.</p> </blockquote> <p>An innate wish there is that more people would leave the silos behind and get online as themselves, express thoughts that are their own, not mindless reposts and shares, and at the site they control - their blogs<a href=\"#footnote-1Y07\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-1Y07\"><sup>1</sup></a>. At the same time, the hope is the hosting platforms make it simpler to book such places online and get them up and running easily.</p> <p>I think there has already been a huge improvement on this front. There are numerous platforms, like Wordpress, Ghost and others<a href=\"#footnote-2Y07\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-2Y07\"><sup>2</sup></a>, that are making it simpler to get your own blogs up and running. They also allow you to link these blogs to your domain without fussing over hosting/maintenance. The promise is simple. Jump in with a free tier&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;if you are happy and if you want to, just switch to a paid account.</p> <p>But then comes the million dollars question? What&#x2019;s the point if what I write reaches no one? If no one reads it or talks about it? If everyone keeps shouting in the void without anyone listening, one better not spend the energy. After all, we are sociable. We like interactions, we want feedback.</p> <p><span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> is a powerful protocol that could have solved this problem. Unfortunately, that&#x2019;s what it remained, a protocol<a href=\"#footnote-3Y07\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-3Y07\"><sup>3</sup></a>. It needed a system to be built on top to gain any traction amongst masses. That&#x2019;s where I believe lies an opportunity for <a href=\"https://micro.blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Micro.blog</a>. It brings in that social layer to the thoughts you pen on your blog.</p> <p>You can either host your content there or get your posts from existing blog to the micro.blog timeline. You write on your blog, it&#x2019;s visible for others on their timeline, just as a tweet or a Facebook post will on their respective siloed timelines.</p> <p>But it doesn&#x2019;t allow repost. It does not glorify numbers of likes and comments and followers.</p> <p>Such behaviours and numbers are the signals for bots to game the machine curation systems. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/2/19/17020310/tristan-harris-facebook-twitter-humane-tech-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tristan Harris</a> put this very well during one of his podcasts appearances.</p> <blockquote> <p>Outrage just spreads faster than something that&#x2019;s not outrage.<br /> <br /> When you open up the blue Facebook icon, you&#x2019;re activating the <span class=\"small-caps\">AI</span>, which tries to figure out the perfect thing it can show you that&#x2019;ll engage you. It doesn&#x2019;t have any intelligence, except figuring out what gets the most clicks. The outrage stuff gets the most clicks, so it puts that at the top.</p> </blockquote> <p>So what do we do then? As Don MacDonald pondered in one of his posts, <a href=\"http://donmacdonald.com/2018/02/is-sharing-bad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">is sharing a problem</a>? Shall we just stop sharing?</p> <p>I doubt that will be effective. It will work when <em>we</em> make it work. We need to take control of what gets presented to us to consume. It cannot be done by a corporate inclined primarily first to maximise its margins. It cannot be done by an algorithm that&#x2019;s designed to gallop every signal and spit a feed to maximise engagement.</p> <p>Once we start consuming, reading, healthy, we will think healthy. And we should think. And share, and respond we should. Let&#x2019;s just make sure it is a space that represents us. A space that one can point to and say that&#x2019;s my thoughts in there. My social presence, a signature. Let open web be that space.</p> <section class=\"footnotes\"> <hr /> <ol> <li id=\"footnote-1Y07\"><p>I use blog and site interchangeably throughout this article.

				"title": "Communities to Combat Isolation",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>This is such a feel-good post to cheer one up on how a town in Somerset realised the ill effects of loneliness, isolation had and combated the perceived causes head-on.</p> <blockquote> <p>The Compassionate Frome project was launched in 2013 by Helen Kingston, a <span class=\"small-caps\">GP</span> there. She kept encountering patients who seemed defeated by the medicalisation of their lives: treated as if they were a cluster of symptoms rather than a human being who happened to have health problems. Staff at her practice were stressed and dejected by what she calls<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>silo working&#x201D;.<br /> <br /> So, with the help of the <span class=\"small-caps\">NHS</span> group Health Connections Mendip and the town council, her practice set up a directory of agencies and community groups.</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, the effects were obvious, there to be seen for all.</p> <blockquote> <p>Helen Kingston reports that patients who once asked,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>What are you going to do about my problem?&#x201D; now tell her,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>This is what I&#x2019;m thinking of doing next.&#x201D; They are, in other words, no longer a set of symptoms, but people with agency.</p> </blockquote> <p>This really made me stop and ponder on where we, as community, have reached. I remember way early in my schooling days I was taught that human is a social animal. Slowly amidst the hustle of the life, driven may be by an overly cynical narrative floating all-around, the definition of being <em>social</em> has completely changed.</p> <p>I remember when I was living with my parents, we used to plan visits to all our friends and relatives when they were not doing well. I used to question then why should you add misery to their already miserable state by being there and making them host guests. My grandfather had explained once,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>They are down, and they need people around them to lift them up&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;more mentally than physically. Hospitals are only paid to take care of the later. It&#x2019;s the former that is equally necessary and effective.&#x201D;</p> <p>I feel we are being deliberately obtuse to not understand that a dull, shallow<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>get well soon&#x201D; message rarely affects. Agree, it may lend a moment of tickle. But it is the social <em>contact</em> that has a chance to heal one completely, not a social message.</p>\n",

Many publications just regurgitate the same news and reports.</p> <p>There was a time I could just fetch opinion/edits &#x2014; there existsed even special feeds for such. Most well known media and news publication houses had different sections for their exclusive contents. <em>Their</em> voices, <em>their</em> interviews, <em>their</em> exclusive reports. Now try to find even a <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> feed for any of the big portals out there.</p> <p>We are just pointed to their Twitter or Facebook accounts, which are useless because every update to their portal goes on their social media timeline. What&#x2019;s the point of every account screaming that we have a new Samsung Galaxy <span class=\"small-caps\">S9</span> out now?</p> <p>Ironically, it is especially bad for tech portals. We would believe they would know better - have clearly marked <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> feeds or social media accounts. Nope. Rarely do any of them have exclusives, most of the times content marked as such is a planned <span class=\"small-caps\">PR</span> play from some company.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Exclusive: A walk through <span class=\"small-caps\">XYZ</span> testing facility&#x201D;.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Special: Interview with head of&#xA0;..&#x201D;.

A separate feed (or even twitter account, for that matter) for your exclusives stories would be a good start.</p>\n",

A decade is indeed a major version&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;a chance to reclaim oneself, it&#x2019;s ok then if it breaks a few of the regularities that worked for you, and for others, earlier.

Hopefully one who is a better, more mature, more compatible than your last major version.</p> <p>Every birthday is a minor version up. You attempt to change, just a bit. You are forced to change by the surroundings, just that bit more. But the changes aren&#x2019;t groundbreaking. They are minor. You are still the <em>same you</em>. With more or less the same maturity and compatibility as your last minor version.</p> <p>Each day hardly changes anything significant. You patch anything that was amiss yesterday. If everything went well, you just glide along the same. And of course, you do not want there to be a need for too many patches, just more regular stuff. So, a version increment, without too many broken things.</p> <p>Is this analogy with <a href=\"https://semver.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Semantic Versioning</a> perfect? Of course, not - it breaks if we go into the nitty-gritty details.

The web does not belong to them. Defend the web. The answer to Google is no.</p> </blockquote> <p>I am torn on this. On one hand, I absolutely hate that Google wants every website owner to go through the hassle of obtaining certificates and enabling https &#x2014; even if it&#x2019;s a plain simple text blog. But on the other hand, I realise that it&#x2019;s too much to expect that regular users understand the technicalities of which sites <em>have to be</em> secure and which are ok if they are not.</p> <p>Making all sites secure will shift the onus to the site owners rather than the readers. Those who know how to, will find a way to do so. Those who don&#x2019;t are hopefully with platforms, like Wordpress, that are making it simple to enable https. It can&#x2019;t be a loss for anyone, can it?</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Ben Thompson of Stratechery has published a (another) great post on understanding <span class=\"small-caps\">AMP</span> and the reasons behind its lure for publishers and success amongst users on web. It&#x2019;s a must read to better understand how (and why) Google is aggressively pushing <span class=\"small-caps\">AMP</span> across its product lines.</p> <p>And of course, he also talks about the core argument against <span class=\"small-caps\">AMP</span> - it&#x2019;s an open, but still a proprietary standard from Google. And they are blatantly exploiting their monopoly in search and online advertising while promoting it.</p> <blockquote> <p>The problem with Google&#x2019;s actions should be obvious: the company is leveraging its monopoly in search to push the <span class=\"small-caps\">AMP</span> format, and the company is leveraging its dominant position in browsers to punish sites with bad ads. That seems bad!<br /> <br /> There is no better example than Google&#x2019;s actions with <span class=\"small-caps\">AMP</span> and Chrome ad-blocking: Google is quite explicitly dictating exactly how it is its suppliers will access its customers, and it is hard to argue that the experience is not significantly better because of it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yes, clearly Google wants to improve the end user experience by giving them a<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>better, leaner web&#x201D; with <span class=\"small-caps\">AMP</span>. Are they being monopolistic along the way? Definitely. Uncompetitive? Absolutely.</p> <blockquote> <p>What happens when protecting consumer welfare requires acting uncompetitively?</p> </blockquote> <p>Now that&#x2019;s a loaded question &#x2014; given that web is spoilt deeply with horrific and utter garbage ads spewed across, what other options remain than such hardball tactics?</p> <p>I do not believe there is a convincing answer to that yet. I am sure the proponents of the open web, myself included, simply do not like Google&#x2019;s utter disregard for standards in <span class=\"small-caps\">AMP</span>. There are <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13414570\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">abundance</a> of examples/opinions on <a href=\"https://80x24.net/post/the-problem-with-amp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">problems with <span class=\"small-caps\">AMP</span></a>.</p> <p>What&#x2019;s worrisome for me though is the fact that Google is markedly focused on elevating <span class=\"small-caps\">AMP</span><span class=\"push-single\"></span><span class=\"pull-single\">&#x2019;</span>s experience on its own browser and in its own search. What if this experience of the web served by Google&#x2019;s platforms turns so much better that eventually that becomes the only web user know of?</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I recently read <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/i-have-forgotten-how-toread/article37921379/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a great essay</a> by Michael Harris where he dwells into his present-day struggles to read patiently, <em>the old way</em>. With focus.</p> <blockquote> <p>Paragraphs swirled; sentences snapped like twigs; and sentiments bled out. The usual, these days. I drag my vision across the page and process little. Half an hour later, I throw down the book and watch some Netflix.</p> </blockquote> <p>I completely empathise with this. I had realised early last year how difficult it had become for me to read, surrounded by the all-time connected gadgets. A ping here. A notification there. And out I was from my reading flow. Into the swirl of unnecessary, untimely, inconsequential<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>information&#x201D; blurbs. What followed was a tap-swipe-scan-stare routine through the varied app icons scattered across the screen. Away from the book, the narrative.</p> <p>That was also the time when I realised something had to change. First of all, the underserving notifications <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/journal/purge-undeserving-notifications/\">had to be purged</a>.</p> <p>Second, I had to start reading in a place where I am not surrounded by any connected device. So I take my kindle, walk to my balcony or to my terrace or to the garden and settle there. Without my phone. Or my iPad. Anyone needs my attention, they have to come fetch me. And I realised I was back to being more earnest while reading. Reading more regularly, speedily. Reading more. Period.</p> <p>And it indeed is important that I read more for me. I realised the slackness in reading also affected my ability to pen words. I stopped writing. I knew the reason, but Michael puts it perfectly.</p> <blockquote> <p>In Silicon Valley, they have a saying that explains why an algorithm starts producing unwanted results: Garbage in, garbage out. The idea is that an algorithm can only work with the information you feed it. Aren&#x2019;t writers&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;all creators&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;algorithmic in that way? Our job is to process what we consume. Beauty in, beauty out. Garbage in, garbage out.<br /> <br /> So maybe that change into a cynical writer can be forestalled&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;if I can first correct my reading diet, remember how to read the way I once did. Not scan, not share, not excerpt&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;but read. Patiently, slowly, uselessly.</p> </blockquote> <p>I just couldn&#x2019;t agree more. Fortunately or unfortunately, we are stuck in this information world. There is no steering clear of the frivolous interruptions we are assailed with from all sides. All I want is to pluck the opportunities I grant others to interrupt me.</p>\n",

It has to convince me that it deserves the right to break into my life, to barge into whatever am doing and make me acknowledge what it has to say.</p> <p>What that means is no new app gets a default<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Yes&#x201D; from me for its<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Enable Notifications&#x201D; prompt. <em>They are always disabled first.</em> (Same applies to my privacy too. No app gets access to my location, even while running, or my photos or my contacts.

I have realised one thing - these apps should not be allowed to light up my screen or vibrate in my pocket. Because valuable minutes and hours are lost in checking if they indeed have lighten up. It also grants me another incentive to access the app and follow what&#x2019;s going on there. <em>Of course, on my own terms this time</em>.</p> <p>Attention is a valuable asset, acquired with extreme difficulty, one that costs dearly to regain when lost.

Why would I do this? For convenience? Perhaps. It was appealing to imagine living like the Beast in the Disney movie, with animated objects around my home taking care of my every need and occasionally serenading me (&#x2026;) But that wasn&#x2019;t my primary motivation. The reason I smartened up my house was to find out whether it would betray me.</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, Kashmir&#x2019;s being extremely daring (which she is known to be) to open her (and her family&#x2019;s) life up to be monitored and analysed to such levels. And of course, there are some key findings, some already known (but still appalling), some new. Here are my few key observations.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>Smart devices are still terrible to setup and keep up. It&#x2019;s a technology of future, no doubt. But future is still not here.</li> <li>There is still a big void for a single hub that talks to all smart devices. It is a broken bridge with silos all over the place.</li> <li>Majority of the makers of appliances are still dependent on external, barely known solution providers for adding <em>smarts</em>. Dado Labs? Seriously?</li> <li>None of the smart home devices follow any principles around handling the privacy and security of the data they engulf. Rather, no such standard principles are even debated over and agreed upon.</li> <li>Smart home devices tend to ping their original homes, the servers, dial in and report on duty very frequently. Typically, for no good reason.</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p>An exaggerated version of this was seen in the Echo and Echo Dot, which were in constant communication with Amazon&#x2019;s servers, sending a request every couple of minutes to <a href=\"http://spectrum.s3.amazonaws.com/kindle-wifi/wifistub-echo.html\" class=\"uri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://spectrum.s3.amazonaws.com/kindle-wifi/wifistub-echo.html</a>. Even without the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Alexa&#x201D; wake word, and even when the microphone is turned off, the Echo is frequently checking in with Amazon, confirming it is online and looking for updates.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, your router remains the prominent data collector for your online presence. Your <span class=\"small-caps\">ISP</span>, the prominent data aggregator. <em>And neither are really too keen to protect your data online</em>.</p> <p>I guess everyone agrees that smart homes are dumb, and there are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/internetofshit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">enough evidences</a> of that pouring in every day. Problem is they are capable of knowing so much about you. And, at times, sending it out there in open without protecting it in any way &#x2014; lending them a lot of power.</p> <p>Dumb and powerful, now there&#x2019;s the super villain from any sane person&#x2019;s nightmare.</p>\n",

				"title": "Why Micro.blog has a great chance to succeed?",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Brent Simmons wrote <a href=\"http://inessential.com/2018/02/01/why_micro_blog_is_not_another_app_net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a great post</a> on why micro.blog is not another App.net. And I completely agree with him. I do want to add a couple of aspects which I believe lends it a better chance to succeed.</p> <p>Brent has clearly articulated on why micro.blog is different, especially the key parts below.</p> <blockquote> <p>And so everyone who follows me on Micro.blog sees my blog posts, and I see theirs. Simple.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>And anyone who wants to could just read my blog in an <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> reader instead. All good, all open.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>If the web is a river, Micro.blog is water, where Twitter and Facebook are dams.</p> </blockquote> <p>I believe that is also where lies the biggest differentiator for micro.blog. After all, the posts are on one&#x2019;s personal website too (I would say they exists primarily on the website first). Not locked in some silo. So in way, micro.blog acts as a feed reader for people to discover and follow posts. With an added layer of interaction around them. Every aspect based on open <a href=\"http://indieweb.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IndieWeb</a> principles. Of course, I am oversimplifying, but it makes it analogous to how people have understood web.</p> <p>An additional aspect that I think @brentsimmons did not extend the argument to is around adoption. For any platform to succeed it is important that a community of entusiastic adopters join. More importantly, they stay actively involved in using and improving the platform. I think with app.net this aspect was clearly missing &#x2014; it managed to address the first, but it just couldn&#x2019;t be different enough from Twitter to take care of later. So it had many users, but hardly any active ones. Eventually, it got crushed under the networking effect of Twitter.</p> <p>I believe that is not the case with Micro.blog. Fact that one can continue to write on his own website and still be involved in the platform for interaction just makes it a good sell &#x2014; especially for the proponents of open web like me. We are already seeing the early signs of that &#x2014; the community is building up, staying active and involved. And it keeps growing (with more prominent developers joining in). So here&#x2019;s hoping we would finally have all that was good in 2000&#x2019;s web, adopted for consumption habit of 2018.</p> <p>#micro.blog #opinion</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Steven Sinofsky, in response to an interesting (and hopefully promising) <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-0b369948-3160-4dc1-92bf-a1d90cc0d44a.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">note</a> from Axios, again <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/958874037081456640\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">raised</a> the long debated point.</p> <blockquote> <p>Adding touch to <span class=\"small-caps\">OS</span> X would bound to be disappointing. Plenty examples of this challenge. Ultimately the use case for touch on legacy desktop <span class=\"small-caps\">OS</span> is minimal. <span class=\"small-caps\">BUT</span> you can&#x2019;t run iOS without touch and it remains a huge challenge to have a multi-modal <span class=\"small-caps\">API</span>..</p> </blockquote> <p>I have always been on the side of touch being useless on desktops/laptops. But proponents of this feature have disagreed, putting forth many justifications and success stories, even if anecdotal, with Windows 10 Ultrabooks. Even though I am rarely convinced, I can appreciate how touch can come handy for some activities - mainly clicks and scrolls &#x2014; especially since iPad with Bluetooth keyboard nullified benefits of laptops in some situations for me.</p> <p>I believe the request from the proponents to Apple is to not make a decision for the end user, not attempt to identify purpose for, or lack thereof, touch. <em>Put it in, let users benefit if they think they can.</em> Unfortunately, I do not think Apple ever introduces an interface to a platform without their justification for and user story behind it.</p>\n",

				"title": "Book Review: Origin by Dan Brown",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>A mystery thriller &#x2014; what do I expect from a book that categorises itself as that? A deep, dark mystery to start with. Woven into a tight, intriguing plot. A protagonist as bemused as the reader about the main plot, but a lot smarter to overcome the clues and riddles en route. If it&#x2019;s a Robert Langdon mystery, I am trained now to expect a bit less of the later. Of course, with abundance of information on art - the artists, the structures, the paintings - delivered as riddles relevant to the overarching plot.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Origin fails on all counts for me. The mystery it intends to solve is too thin &#x2014; the plot is stretched too long. It isn&#x2019;t even a good Langdon story. All our polymath symbologist is made to do throughout is sit through the tiresome travelogues and some bootless scientific blabber. All in hope of an earth-shattering reveal &#x2014; unfortunately even that fails to be one.</p> <p>Langdon is flown to Bilbao, Spain by his old student Edmond Kirsch to witness his presentation with potentially far-reaching effects on the religions all around the world. And of course, humanity too. He has already unnerved a set of prominent religious figures by a special and exclusive preview of his discovery. <em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Where do we come from? Where are we going?&#x201D;</em> The enigmatic billionaire futurist has the world&#x2019;s eyes with a promise to answer these longstanding questions. But a brain-washed assassin throws the world into disarray by eliminating Kirsch. Only hope rests, then, on Professor Langdon and the bold &amp; gorgeous sidekick, Ambra Vidal, to uncover their friend Edmond&#x2019;s discovery.</p> <p>There are a lot of subplots involving, of course the brainwashing of the assassin and his quest to stop the protagonist duo on run, the family feud in monarchy and the struggle of the <em>Guardia Real</em> on whom and what to trust. And then their is Edmond&#x2019;s most prized invention, his own personal <em>Jarvis</em> - the <span class=\"small-caps\">AI</span> assistant Winston.</p> <p>In short, there is a lot going on here. But it is presented in a bloated form where nothing captures reader&#x2019;s attention or gets his pulse rising. All plot twists are easy to see miles ahead. The chapter-end cliffhangers just tend to delay some trivial or glaring surprises. Same applies to the now-renowned Brown template of holding back from reader a specific information that character owns. I admit it might be a style of keeping readers intrigued. But when the substance is not meaty, one just feels cheated. And finally the ending is anticlimactic &#x2014; feeble, obvious and noncommittal.</p> <p>What about the knowledge sharing sessions of Langdon, you may ask? Yes, there are a lot. And I have been forthcoming in my dislike for the irrelevance of them. This is what I had said in <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/644631174\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my review</a> of Inferno.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Many a times, the novel reads as Brown&#x2019;s travelogue of places during his research, just there to increase the page count.&#x201D; That hasn&#x2019;t been fixed in here too. Rather it has gone worse. In Inferno, at list the flabby travelogue were towards solving a clue. Here the sessions are just feckless, as Langdon wanders on, contemplating.</p> <p>With Origin, Brown intended to take on a strong idea &#x2014; about creation and destiny. About God&#x2019;s existence. A deft rigidness while editing could well have turned this into terse, riveting story. Alas, it wasn&#x2019;t to be.</p> <p>My rating: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2192770458\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2 of 5 stars</a></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<blockquote> <p>The time in between sparked a brief panic in a state&#xA0;where fears of an attack by North Korea have heightened in recent months. Residents and tourists reported seeking shelter, frantically gathering supplies, and calling and texting loved ones to say their goodbyes.<br /> <br /> The alerts quickly turned a serene Saturday morning into<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>mass hysteria&#x201D; on the roads.<br /> <br /> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>My boyfriend was like,<span class=\"push-single\"></span> <span class=\"pull-single\">&#x2018;</span>Who do we sue for this?&#x2019; We don&#x2019;t just need an apology, we need an explanation. Someone could have had a heart attack,&#x201D; McLaughlin, 29, said.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>It took something that&#x2019;s kind of incomprehensible and very quickly made it very personal. All of a sudden going through your mind is,<span class=\"push-single\"></span> <span class=\"pull-single\">&#x2018;</span>Is this the end of my life?&#x2019; I called my mom, I called my dad, I called my brother and basically said my goodbyes.&#x201D;<br /> <br /> Honolulu resident Noah Tom was picking up breakfast for a meeting when he heard of the alerts. Thinking he might only have 15 to 20 minutes before a missile strike, Tom considered how his family was split up across three locations: He had just dropped off his oldest daughter at the airport, while his two younger children were at home. His wife was already at work.<br /> <br /> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>I literally sent out<span class=\"push-single\"></span> <span class=\"pull-single\">&#x2018;</span>I love you&#x2019; texts to as many family members as I could. It was all kind of surreal at that point,&#x201D; Tom, 48, told The Washington Post. He made the difficult decision of turning the car toward home, where his two youngest children were.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>I figured it was the largest grouping of my family.&#x201D;</p> </blockquote> <p>Irrespective of how pathetic and juvenile <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/hawaii-nuclear-missile-alert-false-explanation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the cause</a> for the trigger of this alarm was, it shows what the fallouts of such a tragic event, wish and hope it never really happens, will be. Looking at the positive side, if we can, it also has triggered an opportunity for all, the relevant agencies, those governing and those governed, to gauge how ready we are for such a calamity. And how it deeply can affect us.</p> <p>Appearing strong on Twitter is one thing. But staying strong when faced with an imminent, life altering event is a whole different ball-game.</p> <hr /> <p>Well, the user interface that&#x2019;s one of the causes for this whole mess is even horrible than what I had imagined. It&#x2019;s so amusing to find that the system that is supposed to alarm the population about a calamity is such a horrible hodgepodge of strangles text. This is no better than having nothing, which we in India have.</p> <p></p> <p>I know the having-nothing-like-India argument is bit of a stretch, but man this interface is horrid.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<blockquote> <p>Looking at these graphs feels a lot like looking at a graph of dependencies in a codebase. If you add a node for each class, and draw and edge between the classes that communicate, you&#x2019;ll end up with a graph like the ones above. My talk of<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>components&#x201D; and<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>modules&#x201D; was influenced by thinking about these graphs in terms of software. The last example touches on an important point - you can manage a growing codebase without growing in complexity if you manage the way modules connect to each other. A codebase composed of small interconnected modules that communicate with each other in a well-defined way will have a lower complexity than one where the modules communicate with each other haphazardly.<br /> <br /> This is an example of how it&#x2019;s better to manage interaction along a point than along an edge. By that I mean modules that present a single point of interaction will be able to maintain their own internal dynamics without polluting the complexity of the codebase. If programmers don&#x2019;t think about how they connect the modules in their codebase, and they end up connecting modules along multiple points of interaction, the complexity of the codebase will grow.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is such a fascinating read. I have recently come across the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">four color theorem</a> many times in different variants. It is a fascinating mathematical statement on graphs, specifically maps. But I could never imagine how it could also be applied to represent software complexity, or rather how one can build and manage the growing codebase of a software without adding to the complexity.</p> <hr /> <p>Of course, the theorem is concisely explained by <a href=\"http://jamesgrime.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dr James Grime</a> at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Numberphile</a> channel on YouTube.</p> <div style=\"width:0;height:0\"> </div><div class=\"videoContainer\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NgbK43jB4rQ?rel=0&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n",

By the way, <span class=\"pull-single\">‘</span>Mr’ is no less burdensome,” quips Mr Rao, half-heartedly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>So what do you know about the situation we are in Rao?” Naik’s quick, curt response takes Rao by surprise. He realises that irrespective of the words used, the conversation to follow is going to be somber. His brow is getting damp, and he knows that isn’t a good sign.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Nothing much to be frank. I came late from work yesterday, was completely tired you see. So I went straight to my room and went to sleep. I was woken up only in the morning by your friend, asking me to join you here.

He could sense Naik believes he knows more than what he was revealing. <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Anything else you want to mention? We can also go through, you know, the regular <em>drill</em>. I can ask some questions to remind you of stuff you may know.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rao sighs. <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>I gave you what matters Naik.

You see otherwise this detective job is boring. What fun is it to listen only to the sad, murky bites from people’s lives?” He pats Rao’s lap a couple of times, then slumps back into the beanbag. <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>I love this job because I get to know people - their habits, their thoughts, their behaviours. I happen to solve some crazy cases over last few years just through such chats. Nothing much.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rao knows that wasn’t really the case — Naik was in the news a lot recently because he was a sagacious detective. He realises his attempt to skim through yesterday’s happenings was futile. He also knows <em>the regular drill</em> with Naik would be a lot more dreadful.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>As you wish Naik. I have been living in this house for last 4 years. You must already know&nbsp;..”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rao sees Naik signalling something to his friend.

Actually, 3 now, given, you know..” He peeps at the chalk outline around where Joy’s body lay. <span class=\"pull-double\">”</span>I met Joy just a couple of weeks back when he joined us in this house. Adi and he knew each other from the beginning. I am not sure how though. I haven’t got much chance to talk to them about their acquaintance. Adi and I have known each other for last two years. He is a good guy, so was Joy, I guess. Unfortunate, he had to fall this way.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Naik’s scratching his soul patch, deep in some thoughts. <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>How do you think Joy died?”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rao shrugs and then responds, <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Well, it was an unfortunate accident, wasn’t it? An electric shock while using that Microwave? And that is why I was stumped in the morning when I heard you are on the case. Why, do you think there is some foul play here?”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Sir,” Naik straightens up, <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>I rarely do think when I am on a case. As I told you earlier, I just come to chatter. I have just happened to have solved few cases over such chats. Anyway, do you know a lot about Microwaves?”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rao is taken aback by the direct question. <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Why? Me? No.&nbsp;I mean I am not an electrical engineer.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>It’s alright, of course,” Naik grins. <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>I just felt you looked a lot confident on the reason behind Joy’s death. So I thought you must know something about Microwaves that I don’t. Why do you feel that that harmless device is the reason we are sitting here Rao?”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rao continues to stare at Naik, his heart pounding now. <em>I have no idea what’s cooking inside this devil’s mind.</em> The perspiration is now clearly visible on his forehead. <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Mr Naik, I have no idea what you are hinting at. On my way here, Adi had mentioned that Joy’s died of electric shock. I see him lying here on the floor, his legs towards the Microwave, with it still displaying the time since it had been on. Other than Joy’s fallen body, nothing else looks out of sort for this room. There are no signs of any combat that might have played out here last night. So I connect the dots and feel his death has to be natural — he got the electric shock while using the Microwave and&nbsp;..”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>.. and he then turned around to fall face first?” Naik isn’t looking at Rao anymore — he is busy noting down something in his diary. After a momentary pause, he apologises, <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Oh, sorry. I didn’t mean to break your train of thoughts. But you were doing my job so well, that I felt I should help you too.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The tone of snark in Naik’s voice isn’t lost on Rao and he is done fooling around though. <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>See. I have no clue what’s going on here. I have no idea why you are even here. I came home late yesterday, slept right away. I haven’t been to the kitchen since then — came here only in the morning today when you called me. I do not know Joy well, neither did I have an issue with him. He appeared to be a calm sedate guy, it’s unfortunate that he passed away. Even more unfortunate is the fact that now that you are on the case, we all would be held up in this house till you are done and I have <em>to chat</em> with you.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Aha, that’s how you summarise,” Naik is already jotting something in his notebook. <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Thank you so much, Rao. You can leave now.” He goes through the content of page titled<span class=\"push-double\"> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Mr Roy (x)”.</span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Does not know Joy.

They are proud of every product they make and that shows from their excitement while exhibiting each one of them. The unveiling event of any product is never about just showing what the product is or about a spec roundup to opine on how their&#x2019;s is better than the competition. It is, rather, a well-choreographed and well-rehearsed stage show. And for them, it matters that they tell their side of the story&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;be it the detailing that went in while designing it, the breakthrough they achieved in a thing that people might perceive as almost irrelevant or their reasons and justifications behind the known compromises<a href=\"#footnote-1DFJ\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-1DFJ\"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p> <p>So in that sense, this event at the Apple Park was indeed unique. Apple revealed this newest product, one that got unveiled the first - Steve Jobs Theatre, without they arranging any show, narrating any backstory for it. Apple just opened the doors and handed it to the curious media straight for hands-on. Steve was heard saying<a href=\"#footnote-2DFJ\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-2DFJ\"><sup>2</sup></a> at the beginning of the event <em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>One of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there&#x201D;</em>.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I like to <strong>write</strong>. Emphasis is important because that is exactly what I like to do. I do not want to make the writing process too complicated. I just want a blank canvas that I can fill up with some thoughts in the form of words. It should not matter then if I open it from a desktop or a laptop, a smartphone or a tablet. A blank canvas, without any bells and whistles.</p> <p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/_img/clean-writing.JPG\" alt=\"clean writing\"></p> <p>But even after 10 years of the whole smartphone revolution with the iPhone launch, it is surprising why the platforms that crown themselves as champions for writers&#x2019; interests still fail at enabling them to write on the go. The interface they provide are either too loaded or are just non-existent. For example, this is where Wordpress wants the writers to write at on mobile devices.</p> <p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/_img/wordpress-interface.JPG\" alt=\"Wordpress Writing\"></p> <p>Can this be made any more clunky? Why does it need so many options? Why can&#x2019;t words be interpreted as they are written<a href=\"#footnote-1DHU\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-1DHU\"><sup>1</sup></a>? Why does the interface still need to ask for all this added metadata - especially on a mobile device where the space is already a limited resource?</p> <p>It&#x2019;s just the same with many of the professional publishing platforms. They just have too clunky an interface. Squarespace, same. Wix, ditto. At least with these, it can be understood that the target user base just may not be the writers and the bloggers sort. A look at the templates that they provide and it is clear that they want to target the designers, the professionals in photography or the small businesses. However, irrespective of what sites their users own, they need to understand that they do write too, at times. And when they present their intention to do so, shouldn&#x2019;t you provide the cleanest experience you possibly can? Why load them with too many choices?</p> <p><a href=\"https://ghost.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ghost</a> comes closest to ticking all of the right boxes. It has a markdown based clean editing interface with a preview option. However, during my extended usage while I was hosting this site with Ghost, I found that the interface was a bit too buggy and a lot heavy. It tries to do a lot many things which it needn&#x2019;t really do. When I write, I just do not need a constant <span class=\"small-caps\">CMS</span> and metadata access for the post neither do I need a live preview of what am writing. Unfortunately, it just cannot sort out the minor niggles<a href=\"#footnote-2DHU\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-2DHU\"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p> <p>And then there is the flag-bearer of writer&#x2019;s messiahs - Medium. This platform impressed me with how clean the writing experience was. That was before I intended to do so on a mobile device.</p> <p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/_img/medium-on-ipad.JPG\" alt=\"Medium on iPad\"></p> <p>Yep. <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/journal/medium-thoughts/\">No comments</a>. <em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>You can&#x2019;t be a serious writer if you want to write from a mobile device.

But first of all, there is nothing the app does that cannot be fit in the web application. Secondly, the app itself is extremely limited. There is no support for series or publications, yet, for example.</p> <p>This just makes no sense to me. I just cannot stress this any stronger - <em>Do not neglect mobile</em>. Today&#x2019;s mobile devices (especially, the iPad) are getting a lot capable. There is nothing they cannot handle. A plain text editor should be a cakewalk. Alas, I still do hit such forced hinderances.</p> <p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Not Yet Mobile Friendly&quot;!

Just let the text be written without any onscreen distractions.</li> <li>No toolbars, no sections, no configurations.</li> <li>If emphasis to the text needs to be added, let the word(s) be highlighted and provide the limited options then.</li> <li>If image is to be added, provide option as a shortcut (for example, <em>long press</em> on new line)</li> <li>Forget 1-4. Explore and enable Markdown with easy (not live, but closer to <span class=\"small-caps\">WYSIWYG</span>) preview mode.</li> <li>Remember, many writers do prefer writing in dark. Preferably provide a dark mode.</li> </ol> <p>Yes, just roll an empty screen with a blinking cursor<a href=\"#footnote-3DHU\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-3DHU\"><sup>3</sup></a>. Nothing more. Let the writers fill it up their imagination.</p> <section class=\"footnotes\"> <hr /> <ol> <li id=\"footnote-1DHU\"><p>I understand it is Wordpress and hence there is a plugin for everything. But the point isn&#x2019;t if a clean writing interface can be plugged into a platform. Point is why should there be a need for one.<a href=\"#ref-1DHU\" class=\"footnote-back\">&#x21A9;</a></p></li> <li id=\"footnote-2DHU\"><p>Ghost is not an easy publishing platform to work with. You either need the technology inclination of a developer to self-host and roll your own instance of Ghost or pay way too much to get access to their managed platform (Pro) service. For comparison, it is cheaper to get a website with Squarespace with E-Commerce setup than to get an online blog with Ghost. That&#x2019;s just not competitive enough.<a href=\"#ref-2DHU\" class=\"footnote-back\">&#x21A9;</a></p></li> <li id=\"footnote-3DHU\"><p><a href=\"https://svbtle.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Svbtle</a> does it well. So does <a href=\"http://pen.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pen.io</a>. Not sure why these services struggle to exist. They have understood what writers need the best. But they just couldn&#x2019;t convince many to join them. Wish Medium and others learn from these and roll out some more writer friendly interfaces on mobile.<a href=\"#ref-3DHU\" class=\"footnote-back\">&#x21A9;</a></p></li> </ol> </section>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>A good round-up by Quartz on why Microsoft failed with Windows Phone; an attempt is also made to run with an alternate reality where Microsoft has avoided that. Its based on Microsoft declaring<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span><em>Windows Phone is free</em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Compared to Google, Microsoft has much stronger connections to hardware OEMs on the one hand and software developers on the other. Its products are widely used and respected by business and consumer customers alike. By offering the Windows Phone platform for free, the company sacrifices licensing revenue, but this unnatural act is more than compensated for by the expansion of the Windows ecosystem. Windows PCs become more attractive, more compatible with the outpouring of mobile devices and applications created by enthusiastic hardware makers and eager app developers.</p> </blockquote> <p>Biggest problem there? Microsoft just didn&#x2019;t have a competitive solution in 2007-08. They were still rolling out <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_HD2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">devices</a> with <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Mobile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Windows Mobile</a> <span class=\"small-caps\">OS</span><a href=\"#footnote-1EB1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-1EB1\"><sup>1</sup></a> and were struggling to come up with their own alternative which would be distinct from what Apple and Google had on offer. Of course, they <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Kin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">attempted</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2010/06/30/microsoft-kin-is-dead/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">failed</a>, before they finally launched a good enough solution with Windows Phone. But this was around 2010 - good 3 years after iPhone was launched. It just was too late.</p> <p>So, I really think it would not have mattered if Windows Mobile was free. It just wasn&#x2019;t good enough against iOS and Android. What Microsoft needed was a quick relook at their mobile strategy which their success with Windows just didn&#x2019;t allow. Quartz does a good job to summarise the attempts Microsoft made to turn the tide.

Every now and then there is a constant fight between the writer and the tech guy to divert the limited focus. The writer wants to write. The tech guy wants to evaluate the place, the setting where he is writing from. It is constant struggle. It needs to be well defined when the writer needs to be suppressed and when the other guy.</p> <p>Suppressing writer is easy&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;rather writer does not need suppressing. He rarely shouts or fight backs. He is the simpleton; he gives up easy. The tech guy? Not him. He keeps popping his head every so often, questioning the person on how the writer is spending his time.</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Is this really the best platform you would be writing at? Look at that writing interface. It is so clunky. How the hell can you write here. I bet there are a lot of better options out there. Why won&#x2019;t you just fix this? Why write when it is just not right?&#x201D;</p> </blockquote> <p>It is so difficult at times to keep the writer focused, to keep the tech guy far away from pestering. Only way I have found this to work is to give him no distractions. Nothing. <em>Leave him with just a screen, a blinking cursor and a keyboard.</em></p> <p><em>No mobile devices around, with screens constantly lighting up on every notification.

Nothing looks more dated than yesterday&#x2019;s edition of Tomorrow&#x2019;s World. But history can teach us something useful: not to fixate on the idea of the next big thing, the isolated technological miracle that utterly transforms some part of economic life with barely a ripple elsewhere. Instead, when we try to imagine the future, the past offers two lessons. First, the most influential new technologies are often humble and cheap. Mere affordability often counts for more than the beguiling complexity of an organic robot such as Rachael. Second, new inventions do not appear in isolation, as Rachael and her fellow androids did. Instead, as we struggle to use them to their best advantage, they profoundly reshape the societies around us.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is such a great article from Tim Harford, a must read to understand how we have been always wrong while foreseeing where the technology is moving. Especially important is the fact that it was never the big-bang technological advances that changed the world.</p> <blockquote> <p>But many world-changing inventions hide in plain sight in much the same way &#x2014; too cheap to remark on, even as they quietly reorder everything.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tim calls it the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span><em>toilet paper principle</em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span>. Again, so apt. He has a detailed run-down of many such important, but often overlooked events that deeply affected the multiple phases of industrial revolutions. Do read this article. It is a nice summary of what we have been getting wrong about the technology over time. Also, it lets us reevaluate our perspective and beliefs on where we see the advances to be coming from.</p>\n",

I have preferred this approach over a dynamic one that gets driven by a full-fledged <a href=\"https://Wordpress.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blogging software</a> or a <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">publishing platform</a>.

Every option one chooses has its own advantages and disadvantages. And, of course, going with a standalone website builder and serving the content as <em>pure</em> <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span> had its own too. For me, though, benefits really outweighed the challenges.</p> <p><img src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2023/writing-setup.jpg\" alt=\"writing setup\"></p> <h2 id=\"why-choose-a-static-website-for-blogs\">Why choose a static website for blogs?</h2> <p>A static website is nothing but a string of <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span> pages served by a hosted web server. Every document, blog post or update is a plain <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span> page. Given this simplicity of existence, it has some key benefits that attracted me.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>It’s quick and cheap to develop</li> <li>It’s easy and cheap to host</li> <li>It’s fast to be served</li> </ol> <p>Again, Hugo <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/about/benefits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">captures</a> them the best.</p> <blockquote> <p>Improved performance, security and ease of use are just a few of the reasons static site generators are so appealing.<br /> <br /> The most noticeable is performance. <span class=\"small-caps\">HTTP</span> servers are very good at sending files—so good, in fact, that you can effectively serve the same number of pages with a fraction of the memory and <span class=\"small-caps\">CPU</span> needed for a dynamic site.</p> </blockquote> <p>I have already seen this benefit realised with the performance of my website too.</p> <p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Static website has really helped the overall performance — avg response time has gone down from 1300ms to 300ms. 👊🏽😊 <a href=\"https://t.co/pPoQNMXCsM\">https://t.co/pPoQNMXCsM</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/udsTKM0RpO\">pic.twitter.com/udsTKM0RpO</a></p>— Amit Gawande (@_am1t) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_am1t/status/898586698895904768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 18, 2017</a></blockquote> </p> <p>These benefits should attract every blogger out there looking for a simple manageable solution for their blogs. <em>Then why aren’t all blogs served as static website?</em> The answer is, of course, nothing’s perfect and static websites are not for all. They bring with themselves a list of challenges.</p> <p>Creating static pages needs a bit of programming skill, and a lot of interest to slog it out over web design and development. In the longer run, maintaining these pages can become cumbersome if they are to be updated even so slightly, every now and then. Especially, if all you care about is the text you write, what gets placed around it is really not of much an interest to you. All you want to do is write and publish. You don’t want to awaken the web dev in you every time you want your footer to be updated or a page to be added.</p> <p>Ironically, a rush to dynamic websites to solve this challenge is totally counter to what you really care about, the text. The text is light, the page carrying them needs to be the same. To have these generated every time someone requests for them<a href=\"#footnote-28IH\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-28IH\"><sup>2</sup></a> is just too costly. And to have them stored as database entries is just too messy. <strong>It is text, it needs to be stored as text.</strong></p> <p>Hugo (and <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/static-website-generators-jekyll-middleman-roots-hugo-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the likes</a>) provides a nice middle ground. Smashing Magazine summarizes it well.</p> <blockquote> <p>Each generator takes a repository with plain-text files, runs one or more compilation phases, and spits out a folder with a static website that can be hosted anywhere. No <span class=\"small-caps\">PHP</span> or database needed.<br /> <br /> Hugo takes caching a step further and all <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span> files are rendered on your computer. You can review the files locally before copying them to the computer hosting the <span class=\"small-caps\">HTTP</span> server.</p> </blockquote> <p>Isn’t it, after all, better to make the whole user-facing part of your website into a cache of servable <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span> pages and have it generated and deployed locally — without loading the server with a programming runtime or a database? This is exactly what Hugo enables.</p> <p>This helps to design, build, test and maintain the website without much of a hassle. And with Hugo, I have already hit all the benefits of a static website I mentioned above, bypassing the challenges it presents. A one-time effort to design and build the website is handled with little pain; now I can focus on writing.</p> <h2 id=\"workflow-to-write-especially-on-mobile\">Workflow to write, especially on mobile</h2> <p>There is another challenge with such websites that are built locally and served statically - all they contain is the final product, the HTMLs. Any change needs to be followed by a rebuild and redeploy. There is no online <span class=\"small-caps\">CMS</span> to handle your content from a browser, especially no <span class=\"small-caps\">WYSIWYG</span><a href=\"#footnote-38IH\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-38IH\"><sup>3</sup></a> web editor to create or modify your posts. Of course, one way to handle this is to deploy a <a href=\"https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/1325/allowing-customers-to-edit-static-website-via-wysiwyg#1438\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">separate light-weight <span class=\"small-caps\">CMS</span></a>.</p> <p>But for blogging, there is a simple way. All you need is a continuous deployment setup and a couple of applications to handle writing and publishing your posts. I have <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/page/setup/#deploying-with-netlify\">already explained</a> how Netlify has helped me achieve the first part. Below is how I circumvent the second challenge<a href=\"#footnote-48IH\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-48IH\"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li><p><strong>Write</strong>: It is important you can write from multiple places, especially your mobile devices. Web editors of the blogging platforms allow you just that, keeping your drafts ready for you to pick up from where you left earlier. A static website lacks this and so calls for some other alternatives.</p> <p>I use <a href=\"https://ia.net/writer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iA Writer</a> to write all my posts. It has apps for all the platforms I own, iOS and macOS. It allows me to focus mainly on writing, automatically saving all the words as I write them. It also keeps all the posts synced up across all the devices, granting me the convenience of cross-device writing that web editors enable. I find it goes even a step further as it provides me a consistent experience across all the platforms, as compared to the messy state of online writing — more on this later.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Deploy</strong>: Doing this from desktop was always trivial; handling this from mobile was what puzzled me. However I managed to get a workable solution. Once I have the post ready, I use <a href=\"https://git2go.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Git2Go</a> to push the final Markdown (.md) files to my Git repository. Net\nlify does the rest, making the post available at the website. Any minor modifications, it is just an update with iA Writer to these .md files and a push via Git2Go.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Workflow</strong>: Though it is easy to say just write at one place and push to repository, it would be a significant effort to get a file, as per Hugo-defined format, ready for writing. Any generator needs some added metadata, <em>front matter</em> in Hugo land, embedded along with the content to create a serve-ready <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span>. Adding this to every post I write would have been a downer; especially with my intention of writing different types of posts - fiction, non-fiction and links.</p> <p>It needed <a href=\"https://www.workflow.is/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Workflow</a>, I mean literally. The Workflow app is a boon for anyone who wants to automate common tasks on iOS. It is a powerful tool with hundreds of actions that can be easily stitched together to create a workflow — one that can handle complex tasks with a single click. For example, here’s my workflow to get a link post ready.</p></li> </ol> <ul> <li>Once I find a link I want to share and add some comment on, I open it in Safari and just copy the content I want to comment on</li> <li>I trigger the relevant workflow from the share sheet</li> <li>Workflow then <ul> <li>fetches the template for the link post</li> <li>adds the link to the metadata as the source <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span></li> <li>adds the current date and time as the post date</li> <li>adds the title I provide (or the title of original post if none provided)</li> <li>takes the content from clipboard, adds to the content body</li> <li>saves the file and opens it in iA Writer to be edited further</li> </ul></li> <li>Once the post is ready to be published, I just export the post as Markdown from iA Writer and import it to Git2Go in the content section.</li> <li>Commit & Push, and the link post is ready on the website.</li> </ul> <p>This is just one such workflow. I have managed to create one each for every type of posts I write. Workflow does the routine heavy lifting for me, allowing me to focus on writing.</p> <p class=\"sec-break\" style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"> </p><p>I know just this effort might be overwhelming for many. The act of building, managing and updating the static websites is not everybody’s cup of tea. However, for me, I have found that this triplet of enablers - iA Writer, Git2Go and Workflow - serves me well. I have never been so satisfied with either the website or the process involved in publishing to it. I am pretty confident this setup, with minor modifications, will last long.</p> <section class=\"footnotes\"> <hr /> <ol> <li id=\"footnote-18IH\"><p>Heng’s website<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span><a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/05/02/top-ten-static-website-generators/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">theSiteWizard</a><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">”</span> is really a great resource for anyone interested in building or maintaining their own websites.

Given I had ample time before my Squarespace subscription expired, I attempted it again this time. I believe I did not fail. This is a static site, built with <a href=\"http://gohugo.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hugo</a>. It was the ease with which I could get a site running on my dev environment via Hugo that convinced me about the viability of this whole project. If you do not believe, just head over to the Hugo docs for a <em><a href=\"http://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quick start</a></em> and begin. You will have a site running by step two. It is that easy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You would have also realised how well document the whole framework is from your visit to the quick start guide. There is nothing that you want to achieve that isn’t documented. In addition, given that Hugo is written in <a href=\"https://golang.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GoLang</a>, it gave me an opportunity to learn a new language. Post that, every need of mine to get the things just right was just a code snippet away.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example, find below a snippet for fetching a list of random five articles.

It was simple and I could see how it can be extended to enable every aspect that I wanted to achieve. So I began working.

Well, initially I wanted to do just that. However, I do want to keep my messy drafts, be it to the posts or the website, just to myself. I could not find a public way to achieve that. So as of now, the source stays private.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"post-note\"} -->\n<p class=\"post-note\"><strong>TL;DR</strong>: The source for the complete website along with all the posts, as markdown files, <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">resides in GitHub</a>. Every change to this setup is driven as it would be in a standard git project.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"migrating-the-content\">Migrating the content</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Talking about the posts, I had to bring the old entries along from Squarespace. After all, this is also a place for my writings. I would not want to loose any of my old ones<a id=\"ref-1DXK\" class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#footnote-1DXK\"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This time, though, I did not have the luxury of the out-of-box imports. I had to do it on my own. Well, I did have a couple of points playing on my side.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>I have been writing all my posts in <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">markdown</a> format and exporting them as required.</li><li>Current setup with Hugo is all markdown driven, where every content exists as a <code>.md</code> file.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, all I had to do was find a way to export the content from Squarespace as markdown files. I wish it was that simple; it wasn’t. The only option that Squarespace supports for export is as a Wordpress package. However, anyone who has been blogging for even a slightest of time would know Wordpress package should be fine. Because there is nothing to be done with a Wordpress package that no one else has already tried. Just getting markdown files out of that must be a cakewalk. Markdown, after all, is a geek’s solution.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And as I thought, it already is handled. <a href=\"https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ExitWP</a> is a great tool to migrate a Wordpress blog to a static site. It is introduced as a tool to convert to <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span><em>the <a href=\"https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">jekyll</a> blog engine</em><span class=\"pull-double\">”</span>. But that should be fine. Both Jekyll and Hugo use markdown files as content.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After going through the steps as documented at the git repo for ExitWP, I had all the content available as markdown files<a id=\"ref-2DXK\" class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#footnote-2DXK\"><sup>2</sup></a>. It did need the below minor cleanup.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Images had to be handled separately. All references were to the Squarespace domain. Thankfully, I maintain a credit link with every image to the original one. So I just had to re-download, compress and deploy them.</li><li>Front matter needed porting to the Hugo standard. I did weigh in the option to write a script to do that. But then ended up siding on doing it manually.</li><li>Post content did need some minor fixing. ExitWP has some issue handling and regenerating the emphasis, especially around symbols (for example, quotation marks, dashes etc).</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Deploy the post, test each one from the post link on dev and I had all my content back. Thanks to this effort, I believe I never have to worry about porting out my content ever. Every published copy of a post stays as a raw file with me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"post-note\"} -->\n<p class=\"post-note\"><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Export contents from Squarespace to Wordpress package. Use ExitWP to convert it into markdown files. Cleanup. Deploy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"deploying-with-netlify\">Deploying with Netlify</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once I had a site running on dev and tested multiple times to bring it to my liking, I had to start thinking on a place to deploy it. And of course, Hugo has all the possible options <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">well documented</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As my code was in GitHub, the first option I tried was to <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deploy it</a> on GitHub Pages. I configured Hugo to generate the static pages in a defined directory (configured as submodule for the GitHub pages repository). I built my site, pushed the changes and deployed, and it all looked fine. However, there was just one problem — the deployment workflow was a bit messy. In addition there were few more niggles<a id=\"ref-3DXK\" class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#footnote-3DXK\"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>There is no provision for <span class=\"small-caps\">SSL</span> with custom domains. So they cannot yet be delivered over secure <code>http</code>.</li><li>Auto-triggering for build and deploy had to be configured as web hooks.</li><li>Given the deployment workflow, publishing from mobile was just out of question.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On reading some more, I found a far simpler option in <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Netlify</a>. Again I will let the official document explain itself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Netlify builds, deploys and hosts your front end. It provides continuous deployment services, global <span class=\"small-caps\">CDN</span>, ultra-fast <span class=\"small-caps\">DNS</span>, atomic deploys, instant cache invalidation, one-click <span class=\"small-caps\">SSL</span>, a browser-based interface, a <span class=\"small-caps\">CLI</span>, and many other features for managing your Hugo website.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One might say jargon, but there are key needs I had which GitHub pages just didn’t handle — a couple being continuous deployment and one-click <span class=\"small-caps\">SSL</span>. So I did <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">another deployment</a> with Netlify and again fell for the simplicity of the things involved. No configuration head-ache. No custom workflow to handle the built site separately.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Write Frontend Code. Push it. We handle the rest.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yes it, indeed, is that easy. It doesn’t matter then where you push to the repository from, mobile or desktop.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is one issue with the Hugo documentation though. One does not need to trigger a build command with Hugo version number appended in it. Just configure a parameter in the build for the version of your Hugo environment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3573,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/bdc49e6024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3573\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once the Netlify account was created and the continuous deployment for the site setup, I just followed the documentation for using custom domain and setting up <span class=\"small-caps\">SSL</span>.

I really can&#x2019;t imagine what else it could be. I&#x2019;m personally sympathetic to placing a high value on aesthetics even when it might come at a small cost to usability. But in this case, I think Safari&#x2019;s tab design &#x2014; even if you do think it&#x2019;s aesthetically more appealing &#x2014; comes at a large cost in usability and clarity. The balance between what looks best and what works best is way out of whack with Safari&#x2019;s tabs.</p> </blockquote> <p>If that is the reason why there are no favicons in Safari tabs, I believe Apple is taking there quest for design too far. Apple gets blamed for always leaning towards form-over-function. I could see every time why some groups might support the said decision. But this time, I just cannot fathom how someone can find this to be a releasable solution. This is senseless.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Such a refreshing edit this published as part of Sunday Review at The New York Times. The contrast between people&#x2019;s real lives and ones as perceived by their<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>friends&#x201D; on social media is so succinctly articulated by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz. Especially evident is the side of us exposed to Facebook as against Google (the search engine).</p> <blockquote> <p>Alone with a screen and anonymous, people tend to tell Google things they don&#x2019;t reveal to social media; they even tell Google things they don&#x2019;t tell to anybody else. Google offers digital truth serum. The words we type there are more honest than the pictures we present on Facebook or Instagram.<br /> <br /> Sometimes the contrasts in different data sources are amusing. Consider how wives speak about their husbands.<br /> <br /> On social media, the top descriptors to complete the phrase<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>My husband is &#x2026;&#x201D; are<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>the best,&#x201D;<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>my best friend,&#x201D;<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>amazing,&#x201D;<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>the greatest&#x201D; and<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>so cute.&#x201D; On Google, one of the top five ways to complete that phrase is also<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>amazing.&#x201D; So that checks out. The other four:<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>a jerk,&#x201D;<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>annoying,&#x201D;<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>gay&#x201D; and<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>mean.</p> </blockquote> <p>I just could not have put this is in a better way. The fakeness of what streams at Facebook has always been at the crux of the platform being disliked by a vocal minority, especially the geeks. It won&#x2019;t be too much of a stretch for the argument to say if it is not fake, it is not visible on the Facebook timeline.</p> <p>How does one protect oneself from getting miserable at the hands of this streaming pile of curated noise?</p> <blockquote> <p>Once you&#x2019;ve looked at enough aggregate search data, it&#x2019;s hard to take the curated selves we see on social media too seriously. Or, as I like to sum up what Google data has taught me: We&#x2019;re all a mess.<br /> <br /> Now, you may not be a data scientist. You may not know how to code in R or calculate a confidence interval. But you can still take advantage of big data and digital truth serum to put an end to envy &#x2014; or at least take some of the bite out of it.<br /> <br /> Any time you are feeling down about your life after lurking on Facebook, go to Google and start typing stuff into the search box. Google&#x2019;s autocomplete will tell you the searches other people are making. Type in<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>I always &#x2026;&#x201D; and you may see the suggestion, based on other people&#x2019;s searches,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>I always feel tired&#x201D; or<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>I always have diarrhea.&#x201D; This can offer a stark contrast to social media, where everybody<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>always&#x201D; seems to be on a Caribbean vacation.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yep, the best lifehack I have read in a long long time.

Following passage is a sheer eye-opener.</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=\"small-caps\">UCLA</span> Information Studies professor Sarah Roberts has been studying the lives of raters for the past five years, traveling from California to the Philippines to interview workers. She told Ars that one constant in all their stories is that these workers feel isolated from the companies like Google and Facebook, even though most of their work benefits them. Some say that they know they work for Google, but Google doesn&#x2019;t know they work there.<br /> <br /> Roberts believes that big companies like Google want to keep raters hidden, largely because they like to boast about how many tasks they handle with <span class=\"small-caps\">AI</span>.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Actually their AIs are people in the Philippines,&#x201D; she told Ars by phone.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Are there algorithms in all these tasks? Sure. Is it 100 percent? Not even close. There&#x2019;s some kind of profit motive behind these claims [about how] machines and algorithms run the show.&#x201D;</p> </blockquote> <p>The plight of these raters is real. For all the advancements in <span class=\"small-caps\">AI</span> and automation, there is always some<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>dirty&#x201D; work that&#x2019;s deemed too unimportant, too trivial, to only be pushed<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>down&#x201D; to humans. The trend is disquieting.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Very few books make me root for the central character. Ove has me hooked.. am with him for a fun ride!&#x201D; That was my update a third into the book. And boy, did this guy keep me hooked. I was with him as his past unfolded in front of me. I was with him as his present life was amended by some funny, some happy, some sad events. Above all, I was with him as this <em>grumpy old sod grew into a grumpy, but caring, grandad.</em></p> <p>Author, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6485178.Fredrik_Backman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fredrik Backman</a>, allows the characters to grow and that is the biggest reason the book worked for me. There is no haste in revealing the past or bumping into Ove&#x2019;s future. Every chapter, a short story in itself, unfolds more of Ove and the world around him. You see Ove as he is. You are slowly led to understand why he is the way he is, mostly via flashbacks. You are made to feel for the guy, made to root for him to not stay how he is. And when that happens, because you are already absorbed into Ove&#x2019;s life, you are left contented.</p> <p>Saying Ove is grumpy would be an understatement. He is on the edge always, ready to get worked up. He is disappointed in everyone around him. He feels no one is responsible enough to care for oneself - dependent on others for every little thing. He feels the world around has no respect for rules of the land, doesn&#x2019;t matter they are chalked out by Ove himself. So he takes it upon himself to make sure people are constantly reminded of that. And that&#x2019;s how he lives his life - a monotonous, misanthropic one&#xA0;. And as Ove is planning to end his troubles with his life, fate has just the opposite planned for him &#x2014; to add just enough goodness in Ove&#x2019;s life to thaw the bitterness.</p> <p>The book maintains a wry sense of humor throughout. It made me laugh out loud at multiple instances. Especially, the way Ove&#x2019;s frustrations in other people&#x2019;s incompetence are worded is an absolute masterclass. The book also maintains a deep sad undertone. It does not ever let Ove&#x2019;s sulkiness make you hate him.</p> <p>So be it through his affection towards a young boy in love or forced, but welcome attachment from the lively new neighbor or the unspoken responsibility towards the old, and may be the only friend, Ove always shows just enough warmth to make him the most likable character in a long long time. Or in Sonja, Ove&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s words,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span><em>the strangest superhero I have ever heard about</em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span>.</p> <p>Go welcome this guy, and the gang, into your life. He will make you smile, guffaw, shed a tear and, above all, enlighten you towards life. A must read.</p> <p><strong>My Rating</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1799722518\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5 of 5 Stars</a></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>It was pitch dark across the town of Diu. The street winding down was deserted as usual. It had recently been washed off its weariness by the unseasonal rain. In a way, it was a perfect setting for one pleasant, romantic walk.</p> <p>A couple silhouetted against the discontinuous bouts of illumination from the lighthouse nearby. But their walk was no way romantic, may be a tad tipsy rather.</p> <p>Roy and Joel had been walking down the street for almost an hour. Yet their individual opinions were divided. Joel thought it must have been four hours. Roy, however, opined that he was off by at least 3 hours and 30 minutes.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>No way&#x201D; bawled Joel,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>We must be just debating this for last 2 hours.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Again, you are off by an hour and 30 minutes at the least&#x201D; Roy countered.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>How are you so sure? It&#x2019;s as if you want to stay here longer.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Of course, I do. Don&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Well, not in the shape I am now&#x201D; Joel hit back with his fiery eyes.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Anyway, shouldn&#x2019;t we be searching for what we are supposed to search?&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>That is exactly what I am doing&#x201D; replied Roy, peeking at the byroad they were passing by.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>I don&#x2019;t think we are searching for the same thing, though. If that were the case, you would be peeping minutely down the manholes. Not glancing at the lanes as we pass by.&#x201D;</p> <p>Roy just smiled.</p> <hr /> <p>Ganu saw the two bodies tottering along. He wasn&#x2019;t sure if it was their walk or his drunk vision that was unsteady.</p> <p>One was looking minutely at the footpaths, and in the garbage bins, and over the plant pots. He thought he also saw him once peeping inside a manhole. He was for sure searching for something.</p> <p>The other, the skinny one, was not searching for any <em>thing</em>, though.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span><em>He might well be searching for someone.</em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span> thought Ganu.</p> <p>There was something about these two people that appeared odd to Ganu. They looked unconventionally fresh for the time of the day, the season of the year, and the condition of the city. All were in shambles.</p> <p>Ganu did not like such clean people. He felt no one should be this clean when he was drowning in his sorrows.</p> <p>Ganu started following them.</p> <hr /> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>I think that guy there is following us. Is it ok if he sees us?&#x201D; asked Joel, in a worried tone.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>How would I know? I too am going through this for the first time. I, anyway, do not think anyone ever has faced this. I think even he would not know.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Of course, he would know. He is the one who sets the rules.&#x201D;</p> <p>Roy shushed Joel as he heard the muffled voices, the wailings. He walked towards the next alley&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;there was a gathering of saddened souls.</p> <p>Roy just smiled, again.</p> <hr /> <p>Ganu walked behind them to the crowd and steered himself towards the middle. He saw the back of the skinny one now, looking down at a weeping woman. And just as he saw what lay unmoving on the ground in front of her, he collapsed with his eyes wide open.</p> <hr /> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Oh, crap!&#x201D; exclaimed Death.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Now this hasn&#x2019;t happened ever.&#x201D;</p> <p>He looked at Roy, Joel, and the other souls.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Well people, the only way in now is down. Let&#x2019;s go search for that key to the heavens.&#x201D;</p>\n",

Women Goodwill Ambassador is a must watch &#x2014; not only for the fact that it was highly applauded &amp; admired, but for a fresh view towards Feminism.</p> <p>I was especially gratified to hear her speak on why gender equality is an issue, and a cause of concern, for men too.</p> <blockquote> <p>Gender equality is your issue too. Because to-date, I have seen my father&#x2019;s role as a parent being valued less by the society &#x2014; despite my needing his presence as a child as much as my mother&#x2019;s. I&#x2019;ve seen men suffering from mental illness unable to ask for help for fear it will make them less of man.(&#x2026;) I have seen men made fragile and insecure by distorted sense of what constitutes male success.<br /> <br /> Men don&#x2019;t have the benefits of equality either. We don&#x2019;t talk often about men being imprisoned by gender stereotypes. But they are. And when they are free, things will change for women as a natural consequence.<br /> <br /> If men don&#x2019;t have to be aggressive in order to be accepted, women won&#x2019;t feel compelled to be submissive. If men don&#x2019;t have to control, women won&#x2019;t have to be controlled. Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong.<br /> <br /> It is time we all <em>perceive gender on a spectrum instead of two sets of opposing ideals</em>. If we stop defining each other by what we are not and start defining ourselves by who we are, we can all be freer.</p> </blockquote> <p>Complex topics are rarely worded more succinctly.

Last third of the book completely ruined the build-up &#x2014; which itself wasn&#x2019;t too great. But this could have been so much better if the author did not fall for the pressure to jack up the number of pages &#x2014; the effort, to stretch the story unnecessarily, clearly shows.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s all about the impending war. Amish can write battles well. But he struggled to put the battles together into an interesting story. Towards the end it was just a drag. There was no thrill, there was no surprise, there was no story remaining. It was just an attempt to conclude the trilogy, a miserable attempt at best.</p> <p>There are too many characters, each seeking a closure of his own - leading to too many unnecessary side stories. Further surprising is no character behaves the way you expect them to behave. <em>Parvateshwar</em> doesn&#x2019;t. _Ganesh_doesn&#x2019;t. Even <em>Shiva</em> doesn&#x2019;t - the biggest issue.</p> <p>Sigh. It is not easy to close mystery trilogies. And the frustration at not being clear on how to do so, for <em>Shiva</em>, shows from the plot that unravels &#x2014; left me fuming.</p> <hr /> <h3 id=\"spoilers-ahead\">Spoilers Ahead</h3> <p><em>A side note on the overall series</em>, I am completely baffled by how the tile &amp; summary of the novels set complete different expectations than what the actual plot delivers. It applies for all 3 &#x2014; realised first with <em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>The Secret of Nagas&#x201D;</em>.</p> <p>There was no secret of or from <em>Nagas</em> that was significant to earn a title. This one goes further ahead. At least in the second one, <em>Nagas</em> had significant role. Here, <em>Vayuputras just have no f-ing role at all</em>. It could very well have been some smart brahmin who owned the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>nuclear&#x201D; weapon and it would not have mattered a whit. <em>And Oath?</em> Which f-ing oath are you talking about? Plot goes on irrespective of it exists or not. In fact, one <em>Shiva</em> gives <em>Mithra</em>, he so uncharacteristically breaks.</p> <p>Sigh! Every word in summary is to hype up the mystery. Titles are completely baseless. <em>Not the right precedent this</em>.</p> <p>My rating: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1474308339\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2 of 5 stars</a></p>\n",

It does have that moment of <em>laugh-out-loud</em> humour in between&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;but slow nonetheless. So much so that I had lost the interest in between. It was as if jokes were written around characters (mostly caricatures) and thrown in. And the pages filled in describing the fantasy land and the surroundings were too much at times. But that is before the plot picks up and fun kicks in again.</p> <p>The novel is sheer pleasure after that. I couldn&#x2019;t put it down and wanted to know what happens next. Frankly, more than what happens, I was interested in <em>how</em> <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1654.Terry_Pratchett\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Terry Pratchett</em></a> <em>words it</em>. I have realised that Pratchett is a master of witty fantasies. It was not that rare when I used to pause and admire how unnaturally a feeling (like fear, anger&#xA0;, etc.) can be described without sounding stupid. If there ever was a university of metaphors, Pratchett would surely be the founder of that. <em>And he would still be teaching a course on thinking big&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;weird, but big</em>.</p> <p>So here I am confounded for the first time after reading a book. Do I like the book, the story or do I like the way it is often spun? And it turns out I find the book to be just <span class=\"small-caps\">OK</span>.

Well, can you blame the poor souls who are made to remember the crazy letters every time they want to get something done online?

The problem is such machine generated passwords are usually random Strings; hence they are extremely hard to memorise. Good password managers <a href=\"https://diogomonica.com/posts/password-security-why-the-horse-battery-staple-is-not-correct/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">can negate</a> that need. However, they become a hinderance in an environment where there are multiple machines involved (for example, work vs home environment). Moreover, the security aspect of these are <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/7/4597018/google-chrome-saved-browser-passwords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hotly debated topics</a>.</li><li>Recommend ways for <strong>easy to remember, difficult to break</strong> passwords: An option that is evaluated a lot these days. The xkcd post linked above recommended one such way. It also opened a lot of threads <a href=\"http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/6095/xkcd-936-short-complex-password-or-long-dictionary-passphrase\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">discussing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/936:_Password_Strength\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">analysing</a> the accuracy and feasibility of the same. There were <a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/security/how-to/a8650/solving-the-password-problem-14993917/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">articles</a> and <a href=\"http://www.isi.edu/natural-language/mt/memorize-random-60.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">papers</a> written on understanding and improving on the suggested way. The problem is, eventually, it is a human, the lazy ass, who will decide what the password would be. What would end up happening is instead of <em>”password1”</em> being a common password, it would be <em>”mypasswodiscommon”</em>.</li><li>Go <strong>Biometric</strong>: Apple introduced a working and, debatably, secure implementation of biometric authentication in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_ID\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TouchId</a>. By bundling it as a core feature of iPhone, Apple made it reach to the masses. <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/fingerprints-as-passwords-new-iphone-touch-id-gets-mixed-security-verdict/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tons</a> of <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/09/will-apples-touch-id-make-fingerprints-happen.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">articles</a> were written detailing how it can solve the password problem altogether. Though possible, issue remains this would not happen until biometric authentication comes bundled across all technology devices, <em>even the low-end mobile phones</em>. Passwords remain the standard, and only acceptable authentication method till then.</li><li>Make <strong>passwords die</strong>, altogether: Finally, we come to the most interesting option that can be driven by the application developers themselves and not the users of the application. I feel, this will eventually become a reality.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"passwordlessauthentication\">Password-less Authentication</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A lot has been said on this front too. There are <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ninjudd/passwords-are-obsolete-9ed56d483eb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">articles</a> and even open source frameworks, like <a href=\"https://passwordless.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Passwordless</a> that want to target this by providing application developers ways to replace their login forms with password-less access. At high-level, key steps involved to achieve this are</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Make a user just mention his userid/email address</li><li>Generate a one-time token for him</li><li>Deliver it to him</li><li>Authenticate him with the generated token</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These are pretty standard and well accepted steps. However the issue remains in the 3rd step, <em>how should these tokens be delivered</em>. Whichever mechanism one selects will become <em>the single point of threat</em> to the whole system going haywire, be it then email (<em>what’s the password for email account then?</em>) or SMS (<em>phone is lost, what now?</em>). The <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4308190\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hacker news thread</a> on <a href=\"http://notes.xoxco.com/post/27999787765/is-it-time-for-password-less-login\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">one such suggested system</a> is nice rundown for the probable issues.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that thread is more than a couple of years old. Today, the best option would be to deliver the token to the device which has biometric authentication enabled. As an example, I really like the way Apple has enabled the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204152\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">two-factor authentication</a> on Apple Id. It displays possible devices where the token can be delivered and asks the user to select one. Once delivered to, say, an iPhone, <em>only the user who owns the iPhone</em> can access it by authenticating himself with TouchId. This same mechanism can be applied for delivering the secure tokens of web/mobile applications too. There, the delivery problem is solved.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, given that majority of the users do not own an iPhone or a similar biometric authentication enabled device, this method cannot become the primary way of authenticating users.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So even though I believe that, in <a href=\"http://hypercritical.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">John Siracusa’</a> words, <em>on an infinite timescale</em>, all applications will have password-less logins, we are some years away from realising that dream.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ok, so what till then? This is what I would like the applications developers to do to make this password mess a bit less itchy for me. Decide first, do you really need me to secure my profile via a password? User forums/discussion groups, I am looking at you. I will give leeway to banks/financial apps to make me remember and enter the password. For all others, please make this process simple.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>When a user visits the first time, ask for his email id/mobile number. Next, make him choose a word, an image or, preferably, a set of words/images to remember as <em>“password”</em>.</li><li>For every subsequent visit, just ask him for the email id or mobile number. Even better, <em>just do not ask him anything</em>. Maintain his profile information in cookie with expiration set for a longer timeframe.</li><li>Give him the options amongst which lies his password and make him <em>“select”</em>, not enter, that as the password.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>This novel has left me with a lot of thoughts. First off, I am totally confused on what I really feel about this. It is one of the most difficult books I found to review. So I just won&#x2019;t. I do not think I would be able to word my thoughts well. Well, they are confused.</p> <p>So I would instead refer to one review that I completely concur with. Thomas has done a great job <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1019162825\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reviewing</a> this at Goodreads. Here&#x2019;s how he describes the style of prose in the novel, the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>survival&#x201D; journey of Mark Watney.</p> <blockquote> <p>Watney discovers a problem. Watney worries for a sentence or two. Watney comes up with a solution. Watney enacts the solution with minimal struggle. Watney celebrates. Rinse and repeat.</p> </blockquote> <p>There, Thomas has described what goes on in 75% of the pages. Sigh! This guy Watney is an unbelievable genius. No trouble or challenge is big for him. He glides over every challenge as one would with a game of toys. Actually that&#x2019;s exactly how Andy Weir, the author, writes this; as if he is Andy from <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toy Story</a> spinning an action-drama around Woody during his play time. Throw anything at him, he would have the smarts, the resources and the luck with him to soar out of it. And you know right that at the beginning of every log Watney writes.</p> <p>There lies the novel&#x2019;s biggest drawback. It just has one tone, <em>the tone of success</em>. And you can&#x2019;t build a thriller if the reader is just not thrilled for the protagonist.</p> <p>To sum up, this is what Thomas has to say.</p> <blockquote> <p>My overall thoughts on The Martian center on its lack of introspection and repetitive descriptions of action, its disconcerting lack of characterization, and the drought of struggle each of the characters underwent. Watney faces a difficult situation, but I at no point in my entire reading thought he would suffer, based on his Pollyanna tone.</p> </blockquote> <p>Completely agree. I do not think Andy Weir wanted to write a thriller about a Martian. He wanted to jot down his thoughts on what will it take scientifically for a guy to survive on Mars. And the novel is a breezy light log of these thoughts. You can skim through it without getting involved, like any science paper/theory you read.</p> <p>All said, this is a nice fleet of thoughts, dreams of Andy Weir. The efforts that Andy Weir <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Weir_(writer)#Writing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has put in</a> that <em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>included extensive research into orbital mechanics, conditions on Mars, the history of manned spaceflight, and botany&#x201D;</em> for the novel shows. A one time read for sure just for that. Just don&#x2019;t look for a thriller in this and you should be fine.</p> <p>My rating: <em>3 of 5 stars</em></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I read a paperback recently; an incident that made me realise how wrong I had been to believe one will always feel nostalgic towards books with real paper. There indeed was a time when I used to look down on eBooks as format. I knew I wasn’t alone, <a href=\"http://www.bing.com/search?q=real+books+vs+ebooks+debate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the debate</a> was on. I used to think reading them is futile, a fleeting pleasure. A pathway for a lazy few; the ones who do not appreciate the feel of a paperback in their hands.</p> <p>That was before Kindle happened.</p> <p><img src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2021/a04cdafb87.jpg\" alt=\"kindle\"></p> <h2 id=\"ebooks-all-the-way\">EBooks all the way</h2> <p>It was gradually that I started rejoicing eBooks. It was via the Kindle app first, mostly on my iPad. The <em>built in dictionary</em> was one of the most useful feature that pulled me in. It helps a lot when a person, not well-versed in English, can simply select a word to fathom its meaning. No need stretching out to fetch a dictionary and scan for the word. Either that or to make some broken sense out of the sentence without knowing the word. Not an experience one can call satisfactory.</p> <p>There was another feature that I benefitted from the most, <em>sync to the furthest read position</em>. Be it an iPad, iPhone or the Kindle web reader extension, be it home, office or a lengthy queue of a supermarket, my book was always available, synced to where I had left it earlier. There is some relief in not maintaining a physical book and the nosy bookmarks. They are played with, they are misplaced, they are lost. They even are hinderance sometimes, often when you are in-fact reading. (Isn’t that generally a time one holds a book anyway?)</p> <p>eBooks came handy. But there was still an issue I faced. <em>iPads were heavy, iPhones tiny</em>. Paperbacks (mostly) are best by size and weight. You hold them, read even at a stretch and don’t feel you have lost a limb. With iPads? Well, they really are not made for reading in long stretches. Not at least the iPad 2, which I own. Most of the time is spent in finding the perfect surface for resting the iPad on. Not really a painless experience. Inadvertently, I ended up reading on iPhone more.</p> <h2 id=\"welcome-kindle\">Welcome Kindle</h2> <p>Kindles, the hardware, had just recently launched in India. I knew there were benefits to them. For one, they were made with reading as sole purpose. So they were designed to be best fit by size and weight. I had heard <a href=\"http://sixcolors.com/post/2014/11/kindle-voyage-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">so</a> <a href=\"http://www.marco.org/2011/10/07/review-79-kindle-with-ads-and-buttons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">many</a> <a href=\"http://hannah-thompson.blogspot.in/2012/04/how-my-kindle-changed-my-life.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stories</a> of how it changed people’s reading habits, made them read more. I <em>knew</em> I wanted one. A bit of research, a bit of playing around with them. I <em>decided</em> I wanted one. For reasons of mine (which I would go into someday), I settled on the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B007HCFU90/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3626&creative=24822&creativeASIN=B007HCFU90&linkCode=as2&tag=amitgawande-21&linkId=HMDQIS6SAB7GUNPS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kindle, 6″ E Ink Display (Prev. Generation)</a> with page turning keys, the non-touch screen one.</p> <p>And the reading experience has never been the same again. I am reading more, I am reading longer. Surprisingly, it has made my wife too into an avid reader. A person who rarely considered reading as her hobby, she spends good amount of time finding and reading books. Paperbacks, ones with real pages, could never do that. eBooks did, especially Kindle.</p> <hr /> <p>So coming back to a paperback, it did turn out to be a painful experience. Holding the book was troublesome. Bookmarking was troublesome. Turning pages was troublesome. Wanting to read the book at office was worthless. At one point, I wanted to stop reading it in between, buy an ebook version and continue. The nostalgia, <em>induced by the scent of real pages</em>, can only take you so far. eBooks, for me, have ruined the pleasure of the physical books. Kindle has owned me now; and I can never go back.</p>\n",

I was unaware it is more of a <em>sociopathic, twisted whine-fest</em>. Some can call it a character study, narrative of flawed minds. For me, though, it is all whining. Sick. Sorry!</p> <p>First. You get thrilled only when you long for some character, root for the happenings surrounding their lives. <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21480930.Gone_Girl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gone Girl</a> presented none too me. None of the protagonists, neither Nick nor Amy, interested me. They are too twisted for me to care for them. There was a time I wanted them to just get rid of one another.</p> <p>Second. Plot progresses at unbearable pace. Not slow. <em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Unbearable&#x201D;</em>.

Or it progresses to next sub-plot or twist way too conveniently. Nothing is believable here. I could not connect to, sympathise with or even imagine any of the events. Slow, lazy unwinding, I don&#x2019;t mind. This broken, staggered recital I have problem with.</p> <p>And then there is the crazy middle and end. <em><strong>[spoiler]</strong> When you make me read ~250 pages of whining, only half way into the book, you better not tell me it was all setup. Nothing you read is true.<strong>[/spoiler]</strong></em> The end is dragged so much that I was just turning pages to make sure it ends. I just didn&#x2019;t care how. There is no buildup, there is no climax. It just ends abruptly. Not left open, but left carelessly unresolved.</p> <p>Sigh. Anyway one can say I should not have read this after all, it is not for me. This dissection of human psyche, especially the twisted one, is not to my taste. All I recall is I have never kept looking at the percentage-read mark so profusely ever. And that&#x2019;s where Gone Girl failed me.</p> <p><strong>My rating:</strong> 2 of 5 stars</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>So, I finally watched Interstellar yesterday; after days of, literally, closing ears and eyes on every mention and reference of this word. It is difficult, not to know anything you usually want to know first-hand about. No one else to blame though; I should not leave the decision of ruining a movie or a book to others. That call should stay only with me after experiencing it. This post is about my experience of watching the movie I waited so long for.</p> <p>Experience, yes. About the movie, no. There are too many intelligent posts already written about it. <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/27/7077877/interstellar-film-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reviewing it</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/interstellar-20141105\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">explaining it</a>. <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/interstellar-20141105\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The plot</a>, <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2014/11/28/parsing-the-science-of-interstellar-with-physicist-kip-thorne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the science</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/interstellar_2014/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">everything</a>. This is not a post where I intend to do any of that. This is post where I intend to jot down my thoughts of going through an extravagant experience like Interstellar in India. I want to do this especially given I was watching a movie after a break of more than a year &amp; half. I wanted to see how technical advances have improved, if so, the overall movie going experience.</p> <hr /> <p>So here it goes.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li><p>Experience of booking a movie has improved since I last did it. Apps have improved a lot. I was pleasantly surprised when the app supported adding the movie ticket to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passbook_(application)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Passbook</a> as an event entry pass. Nice effect and effort of customizing the app to the platform it runs on. Surprisingly, and sadly, not many try to do that.</p></li> <li><p>But using the said pass at the movie theatres is still not possible. I searched for the machine or the person to whom I could flash the pass and enter without a physical ticket. Not possible yet, at least not at all the movie theatres. You still have to collect a physical ticket, show it to a person <em>who tears a part of it &amp; hands over what remains as a proof of your approved presence</em>. They do have a machine to collect the tickets though. However <strong>anyone</strong>, with the booking id, can print the ticket without any validation. He, then, can flash it further as a valid entry pass. Plus it&#x2019;s heading read <em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span>Booked by Internet&#x201D;</em>. Sigh.</p></li> <li><p>Multiplexes continue to ruin the theatre experience in India. The aim to maximize the earnings out of the small retail spaces is punishing the viewers. Each<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Screen&#x201D; has a maximum of 8-10 rows, with each sitting 15-20 folks. <strong>That limited is a Screen</strong>. In such small spaces, we have 3 tiers of <em>convenience</em>, Silver, Gold and Platinum. Like a regular middle class person, I selected the middle-tier. Surprisingly, the distribution is as any corporate evaluates its employees&#x2019; performance. 10% are awesome. 10% suck. All others are regular blokes who are just <em>okiesh</em>. Same was the case here; 1 row of platinum folks and 1 row of silver. <em>In between the 8 rows of fools</em>. Platinum folks sat with their necks held high, <em>not because they paid more</em>. But because they could hardly see what rolled on the screen without doing so. Then I do clearly recall a<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>silver&#x201D; person turning around and laughing at the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>golden&#x201D; dummy sitting behind; pointing at his silliness to have paid more. Sigh.</p></li> <li><p>Because<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Screen&#x201D;, the hall, is so small, the <strong>actual screen itself is made small</strong>. <em>And so very close to the eyes.</em> To be frank, except for the darkness and <em>the silver bloke pointing &amp; laughing at the dummy goldie</em>, this was not that much a different experience than sitting a foot from my <span class=\"small-caps\">LED</span> television at home. Interstellar deserved better. Multiplex are to know that. Sigh.</p></li> <li><p>Every movie is to have an intermission. After all&#xA0;, we believe in giving businesses to many. If there&#x2019;s no intermission, how are the samosa, pop-corn walas to get their earnings? So a movie is abruptly stopped. Usually I feel every Hollywood movie-maker is aware of this fact; so I could find a logical break being put in every movie. But I think the person who is handed this responsibility uses it to break <em>when he has to pee the most</em>. Be it, then, at the most inopportune place, in middle of some secret revealing dialog. Who cares; <em>he has pee to handle</em>.</p></li> <li><p>People still chatter during the movie. That is after they have settled into their chairs after arriving late. Especially when in a group during a Hollywood flick. More so if the said group is all guys surrounded by another group of girls. Some smarty has to show off his knowledge or crack a foolish, unrelated joke. Happens.Every.Single.Time. I literally watched half the movie with my left ear closed to avoid one such Einstein explaining every single scene that unfolded on the screen.</p></li> <li><p>And then the<span class=\"push-single\"></span> <span class=\"pull-single\">&#x2018;</span>usualities&#x2019;. National anthem is still played, with half standing in respect and others poking there noses around. Head-shadows of late comers are still seen. Mobiles are still not on silent mode. Samosas and pop-corns are still money-wise costly and taste-wise cheap. Torch-bearers still enlighten the lost and side-tracked, searching for the seats. Sigh!</p></li> </ol> <hr /> <p>Anyway, Interstellar was a great movie; it deserves a better treatment than is accorded. Wish I had chosen a single screen theatre, booked a balcony ticket after standing hours in queue and experienced this marvel on a huge screen listening only to the whistle, and not chatter. Or else simply stayed home, catching it on my <span class=\"small-caps\">LED</span> television. A foot away. Sigh!</p>\n",

Everything is perfect, to-the-point; all about the main story and the characters involved. Chapters after chapters, new plot twists are revealed. The story never stagnates. No character eats up the pages. No sub-plots are introduced <em>just to thicken the book binds</em>.</p> <p>But most importantly, <strong>there is no single person that knows-all-but-shows-none</strong>. Incidents occur and they are presented with all the details visible to the characters involved. Nothing is hidden, made visible only to the selected one, the detective. Because there is none.</p> <p>The experience reading this gem is amazing. I pride myself to foresee the final mystery way bit early than it actually is uncovered; or even hinted at. This one bowled me over. Almost all the 10 characters were on my criminal radar at some point. None stayed there for significant time though. Even post the final chapter, I stayed stumped, wondering what has been uncovered. Because, frankly, nothing is. <strong>This, indeed, is a novel of a kind.</strong></p> <p>If you love mysteries and haven&#x2019;t yet hopped this ride, you must. <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/123715.Agatha_Christie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agatha Christie</a> says this was the most difficult novel for her to write, she took utmost effort to make sure she pens a perfect, unsolvable murder mystery.

				"content_text": "<p>The novel is an entertaining read overall. Expected given that <em>it is penned by an experienced story weaver.</em> But then it also has those parts that make the experience average, at times.</p> <p>It starts out promisingly, Strike interested me. So did Robin (sigh!) and their case at hand. Mystery is woven, with the prose heavily studded in the initial part. Studded it felt, given I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It made me know the characters, though very few, more.The main characters and the plot are built perfectly at about a forth into the book. And then it gets stuck.</p> <p>The mystery that was revealed stays the same; neither does it become more intriguing nor clearer. Lots and lots of characters get introduced, but hardly any new information is unravelled. It was during this time when the prose, that I had initially relished, became a hinderance to my enjoyment. <strong>Especially ones that broke the flow of conversation.</strong> So unnecessary they felt, so much so that I skipped some paragraphs.</p> <p>The plot does pick up towards the final third of the book. Unnecessary prose continue. But this is also when the book becomes unputdownable. So much is revealed, in such intriguing a way. And the plot stays interesting till the end. The climax, unlike so many mystery novels, doesn&#x2019;t feel dragged. The mystery is unravelled in satisfactory a way; <em>a way I do not usually cherish however.</em></p> <p>Yes, I do not cherish the style of suspense novels when we do not have the access to the detective&#x2019;s thoughts. Style where the key information, or the interpretations, are hidden from the reader only to be revealed at the end. The Cuckoo&#x2019;s Calling presents Strike this way. Satisfactory, but not preferred.</p> <p>And that&#x2019;s where the novel lets me down, unnecessary prose, non-preferred style of revealing suspense and too slow a mid-third. Overall, though, for the way the plot &amp; the characters are introduced and the case closed, this is a one-time read for sure.</p> <p><strong>My rating:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1063694455\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3 of 5 stars</a></p>\n",

Couple of feedbacks finally made me jot down the thoughts<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/https://mb.amitgawande.com/page/4/#\"></a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One thing I was sure about was I did not want to not control any of the knobs of my blog. So I had to go all in.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Own the domain first</li><li>Run and customise the blogging engine</li><li>Host the engine</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"domain\">Domain</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Deciding on domain name was simpler part; that is once I had given up on all the crazy <em>pseudo-names</em> I wished my blog would have. So I went ahead with my real name. Simple.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To register a domain, there were a lot of options out there. Some were way cheaper but were sucky and known to follow shady-practises. Then there few that were comparatively costly, but simple.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had heard so much about one such simple, no-nonsense domain registration service, <a href=\"https://hover.com/Dpb5EhLf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hover</a>. Few visits to Hover and I decided Hover was the one that fit my <em>high-horse</em> attitude the most. I usually tend to support the service providers with principles. And it always comes at a cost.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So I registered my domain via Hover. The experience was simple and positively uncluttered. I recommend the service. Give it a go. You will be impressed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"bloggingengine\">Blogging engine</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have been blogging for quite some time now and have owned the free blogs at Wordpress.com, blogger, tumblr and even posterous. I even hosted a blog with Wordpress.org. Each had their own benefits and shortcomings.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Posterous was simple. But it was way too simple.</li><li>Blogger allows heavy customisation, and even monetization via Google AdWords. But it is way too childish. It does not have a professional, or a <em>'mature'</em> look to it.</li><li>Tumblr has nice social sharing features. But that is what it is. It is more of a social network for bloggers rather than a blogging engine. Plus majority of the themes are not good for text heavy posts, which mine always are. It's perfect for images, especially gifs.</li><li>Wordpress.com/.org is the biggie in the space. It has everything possible under the sun. Customisation, extensibility, theming. But it is way too heavy. And far too common. I never like <em>common</em>.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So I was on a look-out for an option that is simple, lite &amp; powerful and gives me a lot of control with what I can do. Enter <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ghost</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ghost is a simple open source blogging platform that you can completely own. It provides simple writing tools. I have already detailed what I like about Ghost in the <a href=\"https://mb.amitgawande.com/heres-to-another-start/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">first post here</a>. Even the community has accepted it, so there are a lot of customisation options available too.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Plus if you like coding even a bit, there is nothing better. I had my Ghost blog running on my local machine and I was satisfied, only after some customisation i.e. I adopted and adapted the <a href=\"https://github.com/sethlilly/Vapor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vapor theme</a> from <a href=\"http://sethlilly.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Seth Lilly</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All that remained was to make it available on the internet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"hosting\">Hosting</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Final call I had to make was about how to host the blog I had running on my local machine. One thing I did not want to do was go with a PaaS solution; basically the solutions that provide you just the platform where you can upload the blog and you are up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In a way, Ghost made my decision to go against PaaS easier. There are hardly such services that support node.js, javascript based platform, on which Ghost is built.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had decided to either go all in, i.e. get a virtual server (VPS) or simply not worry about hosting myself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ghost allows you both the options. You can either go <a href=\"https://ghost.org/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pro</a> with Ghost and let the team handle the hosting for you, like wordpress.com. Second options is to go free and host it yourself. I knew I wanted to go with the second option. And I did.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For getting VPS, I just had two options shortlisted, <a href=\"https://www.linode.com/\">Linode</a> or <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Digital Ocean</a>. Linode was costlier. A more pro-dev friendly. Not something I was ready to sign up for with such simple requirements as mine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the other hand I had earlier experience, mostly positive, with Digital Ocean. Plus it had <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-ghost-application\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ghost application pre-built</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So it was really as simple as creating a droplet and I had my blog up. Finally, I also wanted to secure up the Linux node, and an amazing <a href=\"http://feross.org/how-to-setup-your-linode/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">article</a> from Feross Aboukhadijeh got me rolling. It is written for a Linode node; but it can very well work for any Linux server out there. Do not forget to follow these steps. They are must if you are to keep the node running even for short time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So a day in and I had a secure Linux VPS node running my blog which was completely customised by me, as per my needs. And it was satisfactory experience and a fruitful journey.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Another way is to simply think of it as <em>a medium to express oneself</em>. Every person often comes across such occasions to put his thought, his ideas, his expressions in words. Occasions are aplenty. Event in his own life. Event in the lives of acquaintances, friends or near &amp; dear ones. Or just a public event.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of my friends had a similar occasion, <em>one close to his heart</em>.

They go after what others have written, beautifully never-the-less, but at the cost of it being not real, fake. They underestimate the power of conveying ones own feelings in whichever way possible. The words, their structure won’t matter much then.

Wish them for their successes/failures. Appreciate their kind acts. Console them for what they have lost. Keep it simple, write the words you feel. Take effort to make it personal. Involving.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next go for <strong>an outline</strong> that you feel would be more effective. Decide what is the best way to put your thoughts through. Try and improvise on different ways you could communicate. Do you want to narrate an incident you people were involved in? Do you want to glance with them at the journey you had together? Do you want to reflect upon their qualities, good or bad? Or do you simply want to tell them what they mean to you? Think how best you can convey what you want to convey.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And you would be surprised to see the effect that has; on both the reader and you as writer. Don’t act amazed if you want to open up, to express yourself more. Have <strong>belief in yourself</strong> and try to write more. Do so even on more public forums, about public issues.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Only difference is, in public, the reader might not be the one you can personally connect to. Write for yourself first.

Podcasts have almost become my go-to source of entertainment during my commutes or non-working lone times. If I can focus on what's playing, I listen to podcasts. Music is only for the times when I don't want people to disturb me and concentrate, mostly during work<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/https://mb.amitgawande.com/page/4/#\"></a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's no surprise, then, that the podcast-listening applications, or <em>podcatchers</em>, are few of the most used, and so most important, apps on my phone. And because I interact with these apps very frequently throughout the day, I look for a frictionless experience while using them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/http://marco.org/\">Marco Arment</a> launched <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/http://overcast.fm/\">Overcast</a> I was highly excited. I was waiting for this app since he first <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/http://www.marco.org/2013/09/23/overcast-coming-soon\">wrote</a> about it. I knew Marco would have a different take on how we consume podcasts. I had high expectations while I downloaded the app.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And Overcast did deliver. Almost.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"perfectexceptwhiledownloading\">Perfect, except while downloading</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Overcast gives a different spin to almost every aspect of the podcast listening experience. Just the first impression promoted the app to my home screen, even my dock. There were so many things that impressed me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Overall look, user interface and experience of the app has a refreshing feel to it; even the colours and fonts used are easy on eyes. Playlists management and playback controls are simple and intuitive, equally powerful at the same time. Voice boost does assist in making podcasts more audible in a car/bus.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Smart-speed, the <em>silence killer</em>, is brilliant. It's just been 20 days since I started using this app and this feature has already saved an extra 3 hours on my podcast listening time. This feature alone is sufficient enough to make Overcast my default app. It even did for 2 weeks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However this <em>smart</em> feature was clouded by <strong>the data-unfriendly behaviour of the app while downloading episodes.</strong> And this was a huge minus for the app.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I feel most of the shortcomings during downloads are due to the misguided assumption on Marco's part; that a user either wants every episode from a podcast automatically downloaded or wants none. The belief, it seems, is one would never decide whether to download an episode, manually, only when it arrives.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, that is not true for all. Some of us do like to be notified when an episode of our favourite podcast is released, read what would be discussed and then decide whether to download it or not.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Overcast struggles to do either of it.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can either \"Subscribe to All New Episodes\" of a podcast and be notified/not notified when a new episode is released or just disable the subscribe option. There is no way to just be notified, but not download the episode.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Reading about an episode is not easy too. I assumed initially, and accidentally do so even now, that clicking on the episode should expand its description. Rather it starts downloading it. I have to target the <em>(i)</em> and click it to read the description. Not friendly, really.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":6347,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/8a2a2168c7.jpg\" alt=\"Overcast\" class=\"wp-image-6347\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even when the download begins, the options visible to take actions are not really intuitive. First of all, there is no information on the data size of the episode. It is especially important to display this information when one has to decide whether to download it over the data connection or not<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/https://mb.amitgawande.com/page/4/#\"></a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyway once the download begins, the button changes to something with a pause symbol in it. First of all, as can be seen, the ring around the pause button is no indication of the download status.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Secondly, the pause button does not actually pause the download. It stops it, discarding the already downloaded data and begins re-download from 0% on 'resume'. I understand the limitation that Core Audio puts while storing partially downloaded files, but least I expect is not to show a pause button at all if it does not.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All these issues with download manager really make it difficult for me to use Overcast. Marco does say he builds apps which cater to him first and solves the problem he faces. So he, may be, did not foresee the way the podcasts are actually consumed, especially in non-first world countries.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He, also, may say that Overcast is not for me and I should try the other <em>independent</em> apps he, so earnestly, showcases in the settings menu.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However I really like Overcast's episode management and playback features and would want to use them. I would miss them in the other apps.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as long as the app does not value the importance of data, I am afraid it will stay in my backup folder, <em>waiting for the appropriate update</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One's subconscious wakes up pretty frequently, at times during events not that significant in grand scheme of things. This was one such incident.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was raining outside. I was, however, in a rush to come out of the building. I had already gotten late to leave my desk. Not that I had a bus to catch; rather I had buses to miss. I had to hit the road before the swarm of office shuttles poured on to the roads. That was my best, may be <em>the only</em>, chance to reach home unflustered.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was trotting along the road, with my mind preoccupied with the thought to reach the parking lot sooner. Shall I take a straight route to the parking lot with just a turn or one with many arcs and twists? I had already started hustling on the straight route.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I, then, felt an itch on my <em>left</em> hand, just beneath the watch I was wearing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I removed the watch and held it. I was lost for a moment, looking for a replacement place for the watch to reside. I realised I could wear it on my right wrist too and I went ahead to strap it there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But my subconscious mind, fast asleep till then, woke up making me aware about what I was doing. That is when it dawned on me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>I never wear a watch on my right hand. Never.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The incident got me thinking why was it so? Why was it that strapping a watch on the right hand was such a taboo for me? When did I decide it should always be on the left hand? I looked around me, none of the people had the watch on their right hand. None. No one.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I could come up with some quick answers as to why that might be the case. <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/https://mb.amitgawande.com/page/4/#\"></a> But I was not after a particular, <em>rational</em>, answer. I was curious about the <em>pre-programmed</em> behaviour of mine that makes me do, without much thinking, many of the chores I regularly do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I knew there would be a lot of such <em>wired</em> decisions I keep making, and I went on to identify some of those. It didn't take much time for me to compile the list.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>I prefer even numbers, for any and every thing. Counting, stop-watch, timer, alarm, volume rocker. Every number settles on an even number.</li><li>I hate characters, <em>in alphabet</em>, with pointy triangles in them. V, N, Z. I hate them.</li><li>I prefer path which is straight, with lesser turns, even if longer. <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/https://mb.amitgawande.com/page/4/#\"></a></li><li>I pick a pen up when I want to note down something closer to my heart, for reasons I <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/https://mb.amitgawande.com/pen-is-still-mightier/\">wrote about earlier</a>.</li><li>And many more..</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The alternatives just don't feel right to me.

But I would go back to doing the things, liking them or hating them, just the way I am programmed to do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And I feel every one of us, if he or she decides, could come up with one such list. All we need to do is keep our mind open and question.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One might wonder what would he/she gain from the exercise?

It had a good run through my bachelor life, got neglected later and finally shuttered, post marriage. Posts still reside, though, at a wordpress.com blog, which, deep inside I knew, was nothing but a placeholder.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So my wait continued for the inspiration that would push me to create and own, again, a simpler place for my thoughts. And that inspiration came from <a href=\"https://github.com/cliss/camel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Camel</a>, the blogging engine from <a href=\"http://www.caseyliss.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Casey Liss</a> of <a href=\"http://www.atp.fm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">atp</a> fame.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The inspiration, though, was not because I liked Camel, <em>which even now I haven't made my mind about</em>. But it was because I wanted to have something as simple as what Casey had, and get that done in an equally simpler way. At the same time, I also wanted to learn and try something new.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I knew my requirements were not complex, neither did I expect my audience to be huge. So I needed something simpler than a full fledged, php-rich, wordpress blog hosted on a dedicated host, which I also realised is <strong>too costly</strong> for my needs. Enter <a href=\"http://ghost.org/\">Ghost</a>!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"newbeginning\">New Beginning</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So this is where my quest led me to, a simple Ghost based blog to jot my thoughts down. The reasons, I had my own.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Simple</strong> I had heard so much about <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">Markdown</a> before. I felt everybody, almost everyone who writes for himself, was using Markdown. And every one of them had all the nice things to say about it. Even I tried learning it numerous times. <em>But, I realised now that it is only when you use it that you appreciate the simplicity of it.</em> It really makes writing, just about writing. Something I really needed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>New</strong> I wanted to change everything, the way I write my posts, the way it looks, the way it works and the way I would host. I was bored of all that wordpress or even tumblr, something I <a href=\"http://amitgawande.tumblr.com/\">played with</a> for sometime, provided. It all felt the same. For some time, I even thought about just using Camel. But then I would have had to work even on the engine along with writing, which I didn't want to sign up for just yet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Not costly</strong> For hosting, I wanted to meet the above 2 points first, at the same time consider the cost factor. A free option existed with <a href=\"http://www.heroku.com/\">Heroko</a> as suggested by <a href=\"http://www.caseyliss.com/2014/5/1/heroku-first-impressions\">Casey</a> and <a href=\"http://www.therightcode.net/deploy-ghost-to-heroku-for-free/\">Greg Bergé</a>. However, I either wanted to go all in, with <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-ghost-application\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hosting on VPS</a> or just stick to the <a href=\"https://ghost.org/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">simplest option</a> from the creators of Ghost. Anything I chose, would have turned out to be a lot cheaper than what I paid for hosting the unnecessarily complex wordpress blog.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What I, <em>thus</em>, have is a simple, minimalist place for me to just write. I own, again, a self-built, self-hosted blog. Here's to another start!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>[Postscript]</strong> There would a temporary phase when I focus more on the <strong><em>place</em></strong> than on <strong><em>writing</em></strong>.

Now first thing you have to make sure is the number should be at least easy enough to remember yourself so you do not have to open your contact list every time someone asks for your number.\n\n<br />\n\nNow I always find one which is easy enough to remember myself. But it so happens that the way I say the number is always different from how the person who listens to it utters.\n\n<br />\n\nTo elaborate, I speak the number this way 4&#160;2345&#160;85&#160;15. (Spaces are the pauses I take.) So simple right. Now this is how the other person repeats it 423&#160;458&#160;515. I am like what the hell. It takes me few seconds to realise both of them are the same.\n\n<br />\n\nSo the aim is to, if possible, select a number which is easy to remember/recognise, whatever way one utters it. And I very rarely find one.\n\n<br />\n\nThat&#8217;s not all. Lets move back to the initial situation. As I said, in front of you are the numbers &#8220;available&#8221; for you to select. Available. For you. Only these numbers.\n\n<br />\n\nSo basically these are the numbers which no one, who has selected his contact number earlier, found easy enough to remember. And I have to select one from them. I could, till date, never prevent this thought from entering my mind.\n\n<br />\n\nIn the end, I always end up selecting some number which neither I, nor someone else could fathom at the same time.\n\n<br />\n\nPS: Just received a compliment of my number being awesomely simple. So mission accomplished the second time.\n\n<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/58602469d3.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n",

That was part of the bigger plan. Villain is caught and yippie, everything is goody-goody.\n\n<br />\n\nWell, screw you Mr. Goody G. Goody. You could have made the movie hell lot better by killing that god damn hero, and making this <i>gaddar</i> friend fly away with villain and all the money. Why is there a mental block to show &#8220;<i>achhe ki jeet aur bure ki haar</i>\" (good wins bad leans)? Well not that this is how the real world behaves, is it?\n\n<br />\n\nAnyway even extreme wonderful movies like <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Departed\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Departed</a> could not dodge this pit. Only thing I can say is it takes guts to end movie with not so &#8220;goody-goody&#8221; a situation. I remember one movie which managed to do that. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884328/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Mist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Mist</a>. I still fell saddened when I remember the ending there. Hats off to you Mr. Frank Darabont the director. You had managed to give a most unthinkable horror an horror movie can give its audience. Extreme unthinkable.\n\n<br />\n\nImage Credit: <a href=\"http://www.darpantheatregroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">darpantheatregroup</a>\n\n<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/5b918a8bd7.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n",

And that’s when i start getting choosy about each and everything i would buy out of this space.\n\nFirst thing i need to do is put a limit on time i would spend in there. Once that is sorted out, it is all about marking my spots to ski along. Vegetables and fruits fall out of my interest and a hustling visit settles down the formality.\n\nWhat follows is a child-like admiration for the variety of products manufactured, packaged, transported, marketed and sold at such colorful a place. A cheerful mouthfreshner sits in front of the saddened and ashamed toilet cleaner. Colorful chocolates sit next to the colorless eggs. And there i know its time to get lost. Get choosy.\n\nAnd choosy i get. Tens of minutes are spent in front of each product looking for what fits better for my needs. I know sometimes i have spent too much time and worried i get thinking the cameras might caught me goofing around at the same position and i might be busted as potential terrorist. But what the hell  .. risk is worth it.\n\nAnd then there are those times when i don’t get choosy thinking i know what i want and i have got what i want. And this is what i buy.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n\nAnd this is what the description read (which i happen to read when i rinsed my mouth with this dude)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">For healthier mouth, remind kids to brush their teeth and use Listerine Smart Rinse twice a day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Listerine Smart Rinse for Kids 6+</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/01542b68ab.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /></div>\n",

He rushed through the daily chores, preparing himself for the regular grinding sessions. However there was a tinge of excitement within him today. Surprised as he was with his full on enthu to reach office, a thought brushed his mind, &#8221; something new, something good is about to happen today&#8221;. He knew today was, in someway, special.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He jumped into the office bus, just to get further surprised. Usually crowded, the bus welcomed him today to free spaces. He chose the best among the window seats. <em>Clouds had already swarmed the Bangalore skies</em>, further elevating his pleasant mood. &#8220;Something is surely in the air today&#8221;, he thought.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Whole day he yearned for the change he was sensing from the morning. However except for the persistent <em>clouds</em>, nothing indeed was pleasing him. He had a pretty workless day, which he hardly abhorred. But something was missing. He knew that, he felt that.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">And then, on the verge of he giving up on any hope for the welcome change, it loomed, loomed through the hazy weather. He was introduced to the One. He was informed that One would be bossing him now onwards. The first few sentences from the One and he knew this was the change he has been desiring for. Fully impressed he was with the One&#8217;s fluent and vast knowledge flow. Fully impressed he was with the One&#8217;s sensitiveness for a person&#8217;s goals. Fully impressed he was with the One&#8217;s clarity of thoughts. Fully impressed he was with the One.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Few chats later an invitation was thrown at him, &#8221; Join me for a smoke.

So a person standing in the washroom is bound to get a hit for just boasting to his mirror self on how handsome he really is. Anyway so today as i reached the door, a person came out and we just had a eye to eye contact. There was no collision nor even a touch involved. But the first thing i spoke was &#8220;Oh, I am sorry&#8221;. I was like dude, this is too much. Why do i have to blabber out this senseless &#8220;S&#8221; word first thing, irrespective of what the situation is?</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Few worse situations do come in my mind. I have never been in the &#8220;outside washroom door opener&#8221; category. I always get hit. Now even if i do get hit, the first thing that comes out of my mouth is &#8220;Am sorry&#8221;. I always think why do i have to be so passive when it is me who is hurt. However it is not like i always am passive about the things when i speak the &#8220;S&#8221; word. Even are the situation when i go sorry with a tone of &#8220;<em>you ba**ard</em>&#8221;. May be i have developed a way to swear by not really swearing. You know that cute little silence maintained when someone is boasting about himself, just to convey &#8220;go to hell. am least interested.&#8221; I guess this is something on similar lines.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Moreover its not just about the &#8220;S&#8221; word. He has got an equally senseless stepbrother which goes something like &#8220;Thank you&#8221;, the &#8220;T&#8221; word. Now this too is used in a similar context free manner. I remember a time when i thanked a guy who actually was helped out by me from a critical situation.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">These situation make me think, is there really any use of the words like sorry and thank you when they are used so freely without really giving a second thought on why am sorry about or what am thanking about. Leave aside the crap that it helps in conveying some feelings. Com&#8217;on, there are better ways to communicate the same feelings. After all words are not everything. An expression like below can surely make anyone forgive others. Silence is golden as they say. Rather i feel silence, bundled with perfect expression, speaks a thousand words!</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-311 alignnone\" src=\"http://www.elatedamit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/sorry-300x286.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"286\" /></p>\n\n<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/3bb921dcc3.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n",

Who best to earn it than a lone useless, dumb fellow in the house”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Frisking what i listened for a question to throw back, i asked him “So you were the eldest?

Those were the days when the transport business was calling out for unskilled labour as conductors. My father pushed me into one. The work was simple. Whatever the king of the truck, the driver<em> ustaad</em> would say, the conductor would do. Whatever was literally ‘whatever’, including washing vehicle, buying him a beer bottle, <em>bidis</em>, making him a peg, washing the beer glasses. Anything and everything which by social thoughts would sound as child torture.” I hoped he was not talking about sexual one though.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Being a bad listener to one’s saddest and ugliest of the experiences, i did not want to go in the details of the torture.

Use your mouth in cities more than honking”. I decided not to listen to this teaching of his, not for now at least.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“Anyway about the driving, that was another role the conductor has to play when the driver was <em>talli </em>with beer. Suddenly one day he would pass the steering half crawling and say <em>sambhal isko</em>.

				"content_text": "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Now that&#8217;s not just a random title that i chalked out. Actually it is a fact. I read today that a person&#8217;s brain is the most fatty organ in his body!</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Surprised? Even i was. I mean common. How can a tummy, that can expand to store 4 liters of food i.e. 50 times its empty size, be less fatty than a brain? Even if it is fat, should i even care. I think no one is faintly concerned about some fat crawling over a body part which one does not ,or rather <strong>cannot</strong>, flaunt.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">But as i snaked through the article further, i found one interesting fact. Thanks to that, i can now  sleep as long as i want. It seems when a person sleeps, his brain gets busy to file away all the memories of the day. I can now disportingly say that &#8220;I am gyming my brain dude. Fats are crawling even in the blood vessels now and my brain does not want to die devoid of oxygen&#8221;. Put on a board saying &#8220;Fat brain at work&#8221; and rumble along the snoring dreams.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-290 aligncenter\" title=\"Fatty brain\" src=\"http://www.elatedamit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/fatty-brain-300x252.jpg\" alt=\"Fatty brain\" width=\"240\" height=\"202\" /></p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Oh yeah. Even regarding dreams there are few interesting facts that the brain spins. Have you ever questioned yourself why you don&#8217;t actually act what you are dreaming? Or even simplest form saying what in fact are dreams? <a title=\"Switching Lives\" href=\"http://www.elatedamit.com/2008/09/switching-lives/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I do have</a>. Though one thing i missed is a fact that 12% of the people dream in black and white. I just have one doubt here. What is the criteria that decides whether you will dream in 35mm technicolor or age old BnW? Whatever, its just another example of pointless statistics.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Moreover it seems your brain cheats you when you sleep by releasing some kind of hormone which actually <strong>paralyzes</strong> you. The sole intention is to make sure you don&#8217;t wake up next morning bawling about your aching bum which you hurt when you were horse riding in the dream. In short, it makes sure you don&#8217;t act your dreams. How i wish the brain was not so cruel on mankind. I mean, won&#8217;t it be good to actually go ahead and gym out your body too as the brain is getting fat burned. C&#8217;mon, it does afterall know the burden of carrying along the extra fat</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Anyways, few more interesting facts are canned at the below link. Just go ahead and tickle your fatty brain</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a title=\"25 Amazing Facts about Brain\" href=\"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/sciencetech/facts-about-your-brain/7038\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><a href=\"http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/sciencetech/facts-about-your-brain/7038\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/sciencetech/facts-about-your-brain/7038</a></a></p>\n\n<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/7663b9e5d2.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n",

Yes. You heard it right. Goat arming itself up with a shotgun and making the Vigilante men stare down the gun nozzle? All for a Mazda 323? I mean common. A Mazda 323 can only be as useful to a goat as a padded two&#8217;s to Pamela. If you neglect the lone possibility of she pooping on it. If it has been for &#8220;hay&#8221;, there was at least a chance of this happening.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">That&#8217;s not it all. Actually there were a couple of them. Dude, coupling Hayek with Pamela still keep padded ones look useless. Moreover a couple of goats stealing a car? I know scientists are trying weird experiments on animals these days like cloning n all. But i never heard of such advanced experiment of churning out a species with body of goat and mind of <a title=\"No Country for Old Men\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477348/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anton Chigurh</a>. Not even on the fastest news reporting channel on this bloody earth, &#8220;<a href=\"http://aajtak.itgo.in/index.php?issueid=&amp;id=&amp;option=com_registration&amp;task=videopage&amp;assignedvideoid=4989&amp;sectionid=16&amp;secid=0&amp;start_bottom=16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aajtak</a>&#8221;. So if its not reported on Aajtak yet, its not possible even for 10 years now.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Although the main part is what might suit the tastes of few channels here. You see actually they were two guys who were trying to rob the car when the Vigilantes confronted them. One ran and other turned himself into the goat. Now the dangerous little goat is in custody and the police are waiting to prove it scientifically that it actually is possible to convert a person into a goat magically(!). Now i get it. So it was not the goat who was robbing armed, it was actually a man.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">But now that it is crystal clear, i do not have even a single word to speak? First thing they actually do not shoot the white n black beast wearing so dangerous a throne of horn right at sighting it. Secondly they ask to prove that it is possible that an armed man can be converted into a goat? Common. The scientist have long discovered the dose to convert the buffalo-like-hardly-rising small dumb little ball of flesh into an ultra-active-hard-hitting beast. They call it an energy drink which does transform a sleepy crawling man into an awesome enthusiast you see. So calming down the beast to a goat look alike is just too easy a job. Just a bit of physical transformation is required that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So here i urge the related police staff to take a strict action against the goat and hang her till her death. The man that actually has transformed himself into goat is too dangerous for this world and so are his accessary. I heard they are working on something which can make this happen&#8230;</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-273 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.elatedamit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/kitty_gun-300x266.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"266\" /></p>\n\n<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/31478f9177.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I have been gliding in the darkness for around 3 hours now, for one simple reason. The tube light in my room suddenly felt a strong desire not to glow. It went on blinking at me, i guess trying to figure out if i have worn any .. pajamas or not. I did try and rotate it around, with it never returning me a stare. While spending my precious time there, stroking the keyboard in darkness, a question just poked its head out of the ruffled mind. Why the heck is the darkness there.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-166 alignleft\" title=\"bulb1\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/e929579408.jpg\" alt=\"bulb1\" width=\"130\" height=\"92\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I mean, ok fine. I know why it is there. I do have scribbled through the endless questions on solar system and planets structure and their hecking orbits. But i am not concerned about its how it exists. Rather i want to know how useful is it. I just want to justify its existence with one hell of a random reason, the farther it is from the truth, better it is.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I feel everything that exists, does so for some random reason. Even the minutest thing like a microbe is there because it leads or conjoins together to form or shape something awesomely important like virus, lets say. Yes they are weighty in a sense to control the growth of the big parasites in the form of humans. Similarly something like air, whose presence cannot be seen, is there to blow the smelly farts away. The sole reason for such senselessly senseless arguments is to emphasize the point that, yes, each thing can be tagged with the reason for its existence.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">But even the random mind of mine could not reasonify the existence of darkness. To develop films?? Nah, very few do that now and those who do it actually do it by pulling over darkness. We are focusing on the natural darkness that arises with night.  To sleep??? Nah, actually sleep has got more to do with the time than it has got to do with darkness.  What then?</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I know i am acting a bit ignorant, by may be neglecting many scientific things. I actually want to because i want some reason out of my mutable mind. The only reason i can think of gives me goosebumps.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I feel the whole purpose of darkness is to hide the light. So darkness is not \"non-existence of light\". But actually it is the other way round. Light is \"non-existence of darkness\". Whenever there is something that nature wants to do without making humans aware, it pushes darkness in. So it must be doing something at each night. Intercourse? Quite possible.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">An argument can be made saying people do put on the lights then. But actually you see, that's the reason they just blink sometimes rather than staring. And thats the reason am in dark today. Nature is at work. Reproducing :)</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Today it happened again. A previous <a title=\"What Happened to my Ambitions\" href=\"http://snoozyrealm.wordpress.com/2008/09/26/what-happened-to-my-ambitions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post</a> has had many hits from the Google search. I know there is nothing surprising about this part. But what follows is.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The query type was usually like \"My ambition in life\" or \"My ambition\" or \"What are my ambitions\" or \"My plans and ambitions\". One query was also of the sort saying \"Why have i lost my ambition\". Instant reaction was like, ok, i know Google does answer your query. But i dearly wish it does not move to this personal level. I dearly wish a day would never come when i would google for \"Where have i forgotten my underwear\". I dearly wish i don't.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">But after some time, I thought fare enough. Someone must have searched for an essay with this topic. Afterall even i remember how, during the 2nd -5th standard, my ambition changed with changing teachers and essay books. It mutated from a nation serving politician or soldier to a hard-working-son-of-soil farmer to a life saving doctor. Frankly speaking, considering the level of english i could blabber on my own, the essay that was not lengthy enough not to be mugged up, at the same time sounded good and earned marks had content for \"My ambition\". But i don't remember myself ever scribbling about being a \"gibberish-speaking\" sleepy bug dwelling in virtual reality, being a computer engineering, i.e., to be specific.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Anyways this fact urged me to think what really is an ambition. I thought of mining the precise definition for the word and to my surprise what it really means is \"an ardent desire to achieve something\". An ardent desire? That is it? Boss, i have been ceaselessly told my ambition has to foretell a long time down the future. All those \"cheek-bursting\" aunts and grandmas and uncles danced on my head for ages to know what i would be when i grow old, what is my ambition. I always doubted if they wanted to boggle the million rupees estate i would have. To such extent was my fear that i started publishing \"social service\" as my ambition just to push the demons away.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">But now i feel pity that i was wandering along without really answering that question in the best way. If an ardent desire is what ambition is all about, then yes i would have had hundreds of ambitions. And the list has grown to a thousands now with passing age. With each ambition i achieved, i feel i have installed few more in the list. I know and still remember the whole gyan about a life lived without ambition is like an arrow fired without an aim. But then if i have to talk practically I feel it is highly impossible to lay the path for whole life right at the birth. Nah one can't.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">And that does not mean as a child i spent my life without an aim. I still had an aim to complete my homework just to rush out to play hide n seek or help mom out with an aim to go out for a walk in some mela or finish every possible household exercises even on a foggy Sunday with an aim just to use that as an excuse while am watching a cricket match. Now i know these were my ambitions. Far more practical than being a politician or a doctor.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Yes i know there are still these whole lot of concepts of long term goal and short term goals and art of living and blah. So I feel skeptic to use ambition as a word. I feel i better call it a simple desire.  I have decided to pursue my billions of small but practical desires under the hood of long term, impractical or rather unverifiable ambition of being a respected and followed both professionally and personally. I have <a title=\"What happened to my ambition?\" href=\"http://snoozyrealm.wordpress.com/2008/09/26/what-happened-to-my-ambitions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">already mentioned</a> how my ambitions faded away with time. I know my desires won't. I would be happy if the list grows to some tens of thousands, that would imply that i atleast completed 100 such desires. 100 such ambitionsi will call them.</p>\n",

Its pretty amazing how the author's, the director's view can change a dragging chitchatting of a \"just-met\" couple into such awesome a journey for the viewer too. I mean, even i kind of get surprised that i thoroughly enjoyed a normal passage of some hours of two-people's life, their passage from strangers to lovers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-155\" title=\"before_sunrise_film\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/4f257ae125.jpg\" alt=\"before_sunrise_film\" width=\"207\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Everything about this movie left me impressed. The sweet time it takes to unfold itself, the locales of Vienna crawling beautifully behind the leads, the gentle music in the background. All these small little things just heaved my experience of what lied at the core, the subtle talks of the couple in lead. I relished everything the author was trying to say. It made me think, made me revisit my thoughts about many things. I mean not just about love, about life too. All it had to say about death, god etc. Small little gems like the one when the actress, Celine, talks about the old man who spent his whole life thinking about his career and his work. That was just a spectacularly well written scene.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">And about love, well its better experienced in the movie itself. I am speechless, out of word to spell out my experience. Its not just for the one's in love, but also for the others to relish.  All those  pretty words, the moist  eyed stares, those mushy silences, the tender touches. Everything. The poem in particular written with so plain a word, milkshake, as its base. Man, spectacular is the word.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Yes, I want to wend one such passage before sunrise in my life, if possible in Vienna. And yes, if so beautiful is love crafted on the moving canvas, am sure i won't be alone feeling that way.</p>\n",

I plan not to plan any plan, so that i don't feel bad when this plan of not to plan goes helter-skelter, unplanned. Thanks a lot internet.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Let me explain a bit. I reach home with a plan to read my novel, just to find the internet 'psst'ing at me. Calls me out to check my mails, read some scraps, check out some news on tech n all. And everyday i do fall for something or the other. I unknowingly, or that's what i pretend, plug the cable on and surf through the net.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Actually i did well in between to overcome this weakness of mine. I never fell for anything of sorts. But again somehow he has caught another of my nerve. He actually works stepwise now. Makes me switch on the powerplug spike for charging my mobile. He knows i am pretending to be just charging the mobile and i will turn on the laptop next. And everytime he turns out to be right. I pretend to turn the laptop on just for a bit to work something out and shut it down. But he knows that is not going to happen. Once the laptop starts he reminds me of something i need to do on net. I again pretend not to be surfing the net but just using it for a moment. But in fact, thats what i turn out to be doing. Surfing the internet.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Sometimes i ask myself why do i even try. I know i am failing to boggle my mind away from this culprit. But somehow i think this is that cunning but wonderous buddy with whom you can neither subsist nor part. Yes, that's what he is. Cunning, but wonderous.</p>\n",

A number that has haunted me for more than a month. Would wake up with a stare at it. Take a shower, get ready and face the indolently eying number. Stagger while using it. Bump into it daily. On numerous incidents. Each one having a negative effect on my mood. Just adding to my already tangled life. Twisting it further. Something usual has happened today too. Today i.e. on 9th of this month. 9th. And hence this post.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Yeah i know. The prologue does seem a bit dramatized. But last part is indeed true. The normal routine things for last one-one n a half month have made me bump into '9', unusually, a lot. And it has succeeded in screwing up my mood on most of the occasions.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">First up. The most common and tiresome experience of my life. I have been staying on the ninth floor of a \"still-under-construction\" n beta version of a 15 floored guesthouse. Thats not all. Its each and every part was under development and testing at the same time. And we, the guests, were bloody testers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Lets start with a moment to reach there. You say use lifts. Simple right? Not so soon. The 3000 capacity guest house just had a single lift working for major part of my stay. Best being 2. You say \"whats the big deal\"? Ok, this lift can be any one of the 10 lifts scattered at various different locations on the ground floor. You say \"uhh now thats complex\". I say wait. Not all are on the ground floor. 2 are on first. Further take this. Each lift can take you only till/to a particular floor after or below which you have to scroll using stairs. Does that sound scary? Listen to this. The lifts were also in the \"under-development-and-testing-part\" list as most other parts and so had a most ill programmed chip fitted into her. Usual symptoms:</p>\n\n<ol style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n    <li>She used to wend  the 1st-&gt; 0th floor path via 10th floor. That too without any entrant.</li>\n    <li>She used to suddenly halt its march on the most deserted floor, without sucking anyone in or puking anyone out.</li>\n    <li>She used to make you guess the time she would take to shut her doors for you. It ranged from sweet 10-20 secs after you are mounted or a quarter of a second by which you escaped getting crushed between her doors. (Yes she had no sensors to detect if you were in between her claws-like doors.)</li>\n    <li>She used to making a most ear-deafening moan if you make her wait for a little longer. (A typical girlish behavior. You are not allowed any mistake to be made on your part.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http://snoozyrealm.wordpress.com/2008/10/09/nine/\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-138\" title=\"03102008072\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/49a2a95cd3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"135\" /></a>By god's grace i did reach the coveted 9th floor most of the times. The fact that it normally took me around 10 mins on average matters least considering what lied ahead. The floor was divided, in true sense, in 3 parts using wooden walls. So care had to be taken that you end up in your part. Else you had to crawl through the stair case. The corridors were mostly cementy because of its under contruction tags with most confusing directions (refer snap). Air conditioners in the room worked on random basis and when they did they made my teeths tremble with cold. The taps randomly decided the temperature of the water that come out. (I have got my bum burned once. No further explanations.) The mirror was situated at the darkest corner of the room with the most clearly visible part being my toe nail.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I have spent 44 days in this complete mystery house. There were other encounters with nine like never returned 9 rupees as change at the food terminals, 9 cubicals that i hopped along or the  9AM alarm that brought with it the invitation to begin the journey on mystery land of nine. The tales of these will follow up sometime later.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Finally there was just one saving grace i had with me which provided me the sole reason to go through this tortourous journey. People close to me know whom am speaking about. But i am observing a striking pattern there too. Each 9th of a month brings with it some problems. I can't explain but it does. I hope this hauting effect of 9 stops pressing me to my limits. I hope it stops testing my patience. Signs are not too good. Post is published in the 9th hour of the second half of the day. Ninth hour. Nine.</p>\n",

The fridge full of ice creams, pastries, chocolates, chicken (leg-straigntened sky-pointing turkey, to be precise) ? The television set running just cartoon movies day long with remote just in my hand? To be the richest man, the most honest person, the man blessed by blessings from poor, loved by one n all. The whole lust for attaining some position, achieving some goal, some ambition seems to be lost somewhere.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">And now?

				"content_text": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yesterday i had quite a random dream. Random indeed it was. For the most part of it i was pretty happy about what i was experiencing. And suddenly i went blank. I would say the dream went blank. Making me befuddled. Completely perplexed. Full of queries, queries for myself to answer. But before i get into the dream itself, let me blabber my views on dreams in general.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://snoozyrealm.wordpress.com/2008/09/19/switching-lives/\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-123\" title=\"Stranger\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/c3ee20b08f.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"199\" height=\"300\" /></a>Dreams are angels. Yes, they have the power to make you experience the bests and worsts of your life at the same time. Indeed we experience the dreams, not just see them. How else can you explain your turning, jumping, twisting, crawling, grawling in the sleep. We are experiencing the event, the dream. I myself have woken up thanking god for turning whatever i experienced into a dream. And then there are those times when i just put myself to sleep again, just to experience what remained incomplete, unexperienced.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Further, the dreams are mutable portkeys. I feel i change lives in dreams. Butterfly effect you can say. But there one can decide if he wants to change his life. Here i don't. It all depends on my other self, the dreaming threaded me. If he wants me there, i go. Otherwise i just lay here, wake up and continue.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Details. Two threads, if dreaming together, show how the life each is experiencing. We exchange both the positives and negatives. Yes, if you notice, each dream comprises of both goods and bads. We experience some scenes of that life, both happened and yet to happen. Yucks and Wows. If both agree to switch, we switch.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now you see this concept explains a lot of usualities. Take Deja Vu. Yes indeed it is that 'yet-to-happen' scene of the life. We experienced it in the dream before we made the shift. Those jerky wake ups. May be the other self just slapped me for spending such sucking life. Or may be i did it to him for his sucking life. Roaming with unknowns. Yes, you don't afterall expect two me's having the same set of friends. Those long nights can be the result of just a mismatch between timings of two threads. Same goes for the short nights.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I will stop. Remove your thinking caps and plunge into the dreamland with the view. You might find quite a few interesting answers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Anyways back to my dream i dreamed yesterday. I dreamed i was a singer, i was singing well. (Ok, i never said the other me has to be \"me\"ish. He can indeed me quite contradictory to who i am right?) Audience were happy. I saw my struggle. I saw my first assignment. I was watching myself happy. I watched all the happy me's. Nothing bad. No yucks. And suddenly it was blank. I don't remember something like this happening earlier. The dreams changed. The places changed. I woke up suddenly. But it never happened that the dream turned blank, with me facing eternity full of whiteness.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Puzzled, I lay there, closed eyed and open minded, waiting for something to happen. But all in vain. Blank. Whiteness everywhere. Finally i woke up and <a href=\"http://snoozyrealm.wordpress.com/2008/08/25/tottering-along/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tottered my way along</a> ... With mind full of questions. Unanswered question.</p>\n",

Truly i feel i draw a quite of  parallels with the dude Garfield. I am lazy, a bit overweight and i adore eating and sleeping. Even i hate Mondays (more on that <a href=\"http://www.elatedamit.com/2008/01/operation-not-afraid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>) and feel diet is a &#8220;die&#8221; with T. Me too hate spiders. A kind of sudden chill runs down my spine when i face that fraternity. Even the lucky bite for Peter Parker could not change my lovely hatred for spiders. I have tried entering a lot of weird things mind including fruits, mornings and various other animates and inanimates.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"Garfield\" src=\"http://www.elatedamit.com/blabber/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/200px-garfield.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"271\" /></p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">And this strip just elevated my similarity levels with garfield. I feel i, too, am a little too &#8216;<em>Garfieldish</em>' generous. I mean i provide my helping hand to someone just to end up with a feeling that i was too generous to do that. All because i was totally involved working his work out (!!!) I mean why do i have to do that. No need. What rather i should have done was to just provide a helping hand. Not my full hand.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I know garfield won&#8217;t have worked this way. He would never have worked this hard. I need to do that too. I need to learn that too. Stop working. Just provide the helping hand and remove it. Anyways the help hardly gets noticed in todays world. Am i turing selfish? Yep&#8230; thats another parallel with Garfield!</p>\n\n<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/752ad0409c.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Now this is the topic that hits me everyday, atleast 3 times a day.. uhh .. usually more than that. Somehow i could not pen it out. Finally here it is. But before i move forward,  a confession. This post is mainly with reference to the males. Am not sure how it applies to the other sex. But lemme just blabber it out...</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Each day i usually rise, <em>heavy stomached and ill faced</em>, from my seat. Do something awkward between strolling and bustling. Course the floors of my office/home. Finally bang the door and enter the place. And choose a <em>urinal</em>. Now that's where it is supposed to end. But it does not. Something more happens. More on it in a wink.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Let me first speak out the reason for this whole rush. Firstly i have somehow got molded into someone who likes playing with critical situations. Be it deadlines (not at work though.. have to say ... have to say..:P) or my daily chores. Secondly, its all about the pleasure one gets from the sudden and mountainous relief  through abundant pouring. I hope you understood.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Anyways back to the track. The most interesting part follows. Each time i visit the \"<em>relief camp</em>\", i see am not alone. There is this whole bunch of varied group and thats when my thinking cells awake and start noting few things. Now let me blog down few of my notes:</p>\n\n<ul style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n    <li>Usually the bunch refrain from the meeting each others eye sight. Each time they do, there is this sudden jerk of the neck, as if something exceedingly hot touched the eyeball, throwing the sights up or out.</li>\n    <li>Most of the <em>campers</em> stare at the roof, either with eyes closed or 'blink'less. May be the roof falls in between. What they are staring is the heavens. Afterall what one attains is, indeed, a <em>divine pleasure</em>.</li>\n    <li>There are those few who are relieved enough that they start bubbling at their mobile handsets, basked in the abundant relief.</li>\n    <li>If there, incase, is no vacant one, mind clog with this NP hard problem of where to stand and where to stare. Few follow the route to WC, few stare in the mirror rubbing their faces, few pridefuls even walk back. There are also those few who, just unknowingly out of all the unbearabe tension, wash off there hands!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Now there are few more notes in my mindbook. But for now this is it. Need to totter along. Need to attain the pleasure. Here am off.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">What follows is just a prologue. If you want to directly hit my thoughts on me being superstitious, surf to the last line :)</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">A guy named <a title=\"B.F.Skinner\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.F._Skinner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">B.F.Skinner</a> once carried out an experiment on pigeons to demonstrate the formation of superstition. He placed a series of hungry pigeons in a cage attached to an automatic mechanism that delivered food to the pigeon “at regular intervals with no reference whatsoever to the bird’s behavior.” His discovery in his own words:</p>\n\n<blockquote>The bird behaves as if there were a causal relation between its behavior and the presentation of food, although such a relation is lacking. There are many analogies in human behavior. Rituals for changing one’s fortune at cards are good examples. A few accidental connections between a ritual and favorable consequences suffice to set up and maintain the behavior in spite of many unreinforced instances. The bowler who has released a ball down the alley but continues to behave as if she were controlling it by twisting and turning her arm and shoulder is another case in point. These behaviors have, of course, no real effect upon one’s luck or upon a ball half way down an alley, just as in the present case the food would appear as often if the pigeon did nothing — or, more strictly speaking, did something else.</blockquote>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">More on this and its connection with me and my being superstitious <a title=\"Blabber Land\" href=\"http://www.elatedamit.com/blabber/?p=6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I always wanted to add my tweets to my blog, to pen in the sudden and randomly generated vibes in me. I use to do that at twitter. But i wanted to pull in the thoughts at one place. As i owned the place now, i thought of a dedicated section for the purpose and hence came into existence the &#8220;<a title=\"Blabber Land\" href=\"http://www.elatedamit.com/blabber/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blabber Land</a>&#8221;.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">If you follow the link, you can find the live demonstration of twitter in blog under the first section named &#8220;<em>Abrupt Blabberings</em>&#8221;. The procedure is pretty not-so-complex sorts. And with a simple but informative article like <a href=\"http://remysharp.com/2007/05/18/add-twitter-to-your-blog-step-by-step/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this</a> your work is greatly reduced. Thanks Remy &#8230;</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">But still it would need a bit of a scripting and customizing on your part, for better results that is. Few points to remember (basically the ones i didn&#8217;t :P)</p>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<ol style=\"text-align:justify;\"><br /><li> Make sure you add the <em>&lt;div id=&#8221;twitter&#8221;&gt;</em> section at a proper place. Before pulling the tweets, book the place holder and test the looks with the dummy data. Customize the <em>div</em> section.</li><br /><li>Add the pre-fetch message at the blog. Let user know something is about to happen in the section. A progress indicator would be a plus.</li><br /><li>Now add the scipt that fills in the place holder booked earier i.e. the <em>&lt;div&gt;</em> section. Make sure you rename the <span class=\"embsrc\"><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><span class=\"str\">tweet</span></span></em><span class=\"str\"> in </span></span><em><span class=\"embsrc\"><span class=\"pln\">getTwitters</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"str\">'tweet'</span><span class=\"pun\">,</span></span></em><span class=\"embsrc\"><span class=\"pun\"> to the id you have mentioned in the <em>&lt;div&gt;</em> section above. So in this case, it should be renamed as &#8220;</span></span><span class=\"embsrc\"><span class=\"pln\">getTwitters</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"str\">&#8217;</span></span><em>twitter</em><span class=\"embsrc\"><span class=\"str\">&#8217;</span><span class=\"pun\">,&#8221;</span></span></li><br /><li><span class=\"embsrc\"><span class=\"pun\">Adding the script section towards the <em>&lt;/body&gt;</em> tag of your page would always be favorable. The simple reason being the browsers don&#8217;t start any parallel downloads i.e. of images etc as long as they don&#8217;t download the scripts. It is always recommended that scripts, wherever possible, should always come right at the end, after most of the page is completely loaded.<br /></span></span></li><br /></ol>\n\n<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/2991819b3d.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n",

There is this eerie feeling in being superstitious. But i feel knowingly or unknowingly, we do follow superstition. Ok, lemme not talk about the universe for whole. Taaadaaa &#8230; I, myself, do follow superstition. Or lemme say i am the most superstitious guy among the people i know. No better proof than my following acts &#8230;</p>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<ol style=\"text-align:justify;\"><br /><li>I maintain my position for the whole match whenever india is winning a cricket match. Or whenever something, out of my control, is happeing in accordance with my wish.</li><br /><li>I try and change whatever i can when something is not betiding as i wish, to find out that right position to maintain (refer 1)</li><br /><li>As far as possible, i try and avoid &#8230; Uhhh &#8230; the path crossed by a cat. I know thats really foolish of me. But that is just to keep my mind away from any unwanted superstitious thought, if something bychance goes wrong.</li><br /><li>I have my own &#8220;<em>tasks-not-to-do-now</em>\" list which i, by all possible means, avoid to carry out.</li><br /></ol>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Ok, i will stop this whole self-bashing ceremony now. I know there would be pretty more. Will add them whenever am frustrated with myself. Anyways, I feel most of my superstitious acts are more of an attempt to prevent my mind from wandering in the dusty desert of superstition. You see if something does go wrong if i didn&#8217;t do __, at the back of my mind it keeps tinkering me, further adding to my superstitious feeling. That&#8217;s superstition to prevent increasing superstition.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">But i know whatever i say, i need to stop doing this. I need to stop falling to superstition just for the sake of not falling for the greater ones. I know .. I am working on that &#8230; Have already overcome few of mine. Blog on them soon &#8230;</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">By the way, i did find an interesting article. A guy named <a title=\"B.F.Skinner\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.F._Skinner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">B.F.Skinner</a> carried out an experiment on pigeons to demonstrate the formation of superstition. He placed a series of hungry pigeons in a cage attached to an automatic mechanism that delivered food to the pigeon &#8220;at regular intervals with no reference whatsoever to the bird&#8217;s behavior.&#8221; His discovery in his own words:</p>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<blockquote style=\"text-align:justify;\">The bird behaves as if there were a causal relation between its behavior and the presentation of food, although such a relation is lacking. There are many analogies in human behavior. Rituals for changing one&#8217;s fortune at cards are good examples. A few accidental connections between a ritual and favorable consequences suffice to set up and maintain the behavior in spite of many unreinforced instances. The bowler who has released a ball down the alley but continues to behave as if she were controlling it by twisting and turning her arm and shoulder is another case in point. These behaviors have, of course, no real effect upon one&#8217;s luck or upon a ball half way down an alley, just as in the present case the food would appear as often if the pigeon did nothing &#8212; or, more strictly speaking, did something else.</blockquote>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So i guess i now know how it all started for me. I was ruined socially. Heres all my energy to end that &#8230; :)</p>\n\n<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/32ae109dda.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Finally i succeed. I have been working on this site for around a month now. I, though, had finalized my contents quite a long time back. But it was because of my random vibes, i could never really convince my mind for a dedicated hosted weblog. But finally&#8230;  Though am not sure is it a simple blog or a &#8216;<em>blogsite</em>&#8217;?</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Anyways this the first draft of the <em>site</em> i had in my mind for myself. I will note few points which, according to me, really heighten the user experience levels. It was all as a result of hours of skiing along the web and the constant feedback to myself of my experience as a user. So let me begin ..</p>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<ol><br /><li>More space for the actual content on the page</li><br /><li>Clear separators between two posts</li><br /><li>Easy on eyes font family and sizes</li><br /><li>Non-disturbing ads</li><br /><li>At hand list of recent post and comments</li><br /><li>No bulky colors</li><br /><li>Easily accessible links and catchy titles</li><br /><li>A consistency in the overall <em>site</em></li><br /></ol>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I have thrived to please most of my expectations. Anyways i will, for now, not talk about my real journey right from &#8216;Blogger&#8217;, where it all started, to &#8216;Wordpress.com&#8217;, where it all beautified, to &#8216;Wordpress.org&#8217;, but just the final phase. The final shift, for me, was never a real pain in &#8230; uhh&#8230; <em>head</em>. And it shouldn&#8217;t be for anyone either. Only thing it requires is more of interest for designing and blogging.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So it all started, once on a frustrated day, with research on the <strong>preprocess</strong>. Had to earn my domain name &#8216;<a href=\"http://www.elatedamit.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">elatedamit</a>' which i did. Bought the domain at <a title=\"Rediff\" href=\"http://hosting.rediff.com/hosting/scripts/HostingDomain.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rediff</a>. Few pitfalls, never ever search for the domain you are planning to buy. Especially never on <a href=\"http://www.godaddy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GoDaddy</a>. The reason being various sites internally use GoDaddy for booking domains and, due to some random problem with their coding i guess, they are under impression you bought the domain even if you haven&#8217;t. Best example, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Apps</a>.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Moved to the host part. This was the most reasearched topic by me. I compared rates, providings, user experiences, expert comments and even overall look and speed of the hosting site itself. I really could not single out the best hosting site. Various people said, it depends on requirement. I feel the only thing it depends on is your luck. Choose, depending on how much you can spend, the best appearing host and leave it to luck. Hope that you won&#8217;t face any problem.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Roamed and jumped from <a href=\"http://www.dreamhost.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dreamhost</a> to <a href=\"http://www.bluehost.com/tell_me_more.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bluehost</a> to <a href=\"http://ewebguru.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eWebGuru</a>. But finally i stumbled upon <a href=\"http://www.lunarpages.com/basic-hosting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lunarpages</a> based on the cost to feature analysis. I have hosted my blog with lunarpages for around a month now. I haven&#8217;t faced any issues of downtimes or slow responses yet. <em>One valuable and important suggestion. </em>Never complete the process right at the first time. Let them know you are interested. A guareented bargaining is about to happen.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Once your domain and hosts are connected, what remains to do is limitless. Remove your age-old thinking cap. Upsurge your creativity buds and dive in the vast sea of designing <em>'blogsites</em>&#8217;. There is lots to learn and bit to earn too.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">PS: Do let me know your views on the overall experience of the site. Let me confirm if  i am normal or has randomness caught my mind too :)</p>\n\n<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/317f58e771.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n",

And lemme say, this just acts as the 'POF' (Proof of Fact) for what i will be writing now. Let us get on the same platform first. This post (Will you please not follow the links directly and loose this topic..Thanks) was inspired partly by <a title=\"Unloading Information Overload\" href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB121538872997031145.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this</a> and <a title=\"Is Google Making Us Stupid?\" href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/google\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this</a>. I hope you are still there with me. Because if you were not for some significant amount of time, thats what this post is all about. Reducing concentration levels... POF you see ...</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I am pretty sure most of the so-called experienced internet surfers would have reached at this point far late than they would normally have. Because i have become one of those and i damn know that he would atleast have done few of following:</p>\n\n<ol style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n    <li>Google for some random text (<em>Default</em>)</li>\n    <li>Peeped into GTalk friends list</li>\n    <li>Checked whether have received any new mail</li>\n    <li>Checked if all social friends are up and running</li>\n    <li>Followed into void via atleast 3 Links</li>\n    <li>If yes for 3, Gave a thought and made a point for each one of them</li>\n    <li>Oh ya .. paid some bill</li>\n    <li>Rejected atleast a single credit card offer</li>\n    <li>And oh ya .. worked :P</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I guess the list would build on n on. Anyways the point is surely you wouldn't have, if you have become one of us, read till now at a single strech. (I would really like to know what you indeed did. Put in the comments section. Hold on... Read completely first)</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Ok i won't try and find the reasons for why this is happening because that is not going to help me understand any damn thing. Let that job be left for some XYZ research group of companies. What i would actually try is provide some ways i can become a normal being from a 'skull-headed vaccum with rags of information' which am now. Let me start listing them down.</p>\n\n<ul style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n    <li><strong>Update Google searh bar:</strong> I feel google can hugely impact a large sector of us concentration loosers. If only they ask for some not-so-privacy-threatning but self-embarrassing queries before returing the result. Lets say, \"For how much hours have you worked today\".</li>\n    <li><strong>Redesign Operating Systems</strong>: Huge step i know. The one i would design is, i would say, mainly a build over on MS Vista. Ok , so you want switch program? Start. \"<em>Do you really want to open ...? Yes/No</em>\", \"<em>Enter your Password ******</em>\", \"<em>Please re-enter the password ******</em>\", \"<em>Thank You! Please select the program you want to open. Enter the number in from of the selection</em>\", \"<em>Enter the text in captcha</em>\", \"<em>Thank you! Click Finish to open the program</em>\" and finally \"Y<em>our request to open ____ has been successfully served. OK/Back</em>\" I am damn sure this will majorly kill the frequent ALT+TAB s</li>\n    <li><strong>Introduce Sticky Books</strong>: Ok what if i want am not the comp junkie and still cherish the hardcopies? How can i be glued to the plot in the book? Fine. We will manually and physically do that for you. The books will be fitted with microprocessors programmed for secreting glues for defined time period which would be not less than 1 hour. You see. Its that simple.</li>\n    <li><strong>Rename weekdays</strong>: Ok so point is inject a standard work schedule through out the human fraternity. Lets make each focus on a particular kind of job on the specified day. I would suggest let the week names be <em>Funday</em> (random fun), <em>Moneyday</em>(Money Matters), <em>Teamday</em>(Social Team Building), <em>Workday</em> (I know .. Boring Day), <em>Surfday</em>(Random Internet Surfing), <em>Reworkday</em>(Yeah .. 2 of them. Afterall thats what one is paid for) and <em>Saturday</em> (!!!!)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I know these options do sound rather ludicrous and more apparent changes like stop building multiprocessing processors or build 'one system one application' OSes might sound sensible. But then it is a \"Build dam for water leaks\" kinda solution. Anyways that's my foolish take on this not-so-foolish topic. Comment in your solutions, however foolish they may sound. Remember, there are many like you around you...</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Finally must say I have always been a workaholic enthusiast ... What remains now is just an -aholic enthusiast surfing endlessly in void.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>PS:</strong> If you have read this post in a single strech, i am damn sure you have just crumbled into wrong space. Click the back arrow button at the top-left corner of this window.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Update:</strong> Another interesting take on the same line. <a title=\"I am stupid and the internet made me so\" href=\"http://www.sastwingees.org/2008/06/22/i-am-stupid-and-the-internet-made-me-so/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I am stupid and the Internet made me so</a></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Finally I planned to blog today. I had been dropping quite a few shitty n weird ideas over notepad's bald head. But all thanks to my random weirdness, i flew far away from the thought lane and settled spending my complete time over choosing a blog template. Surprisingly, the decision to change the template was not a result of spontaneous wave of randomness. Rather it was with a thought that a simple and neat theme may load faster. (Not that i wanted not to loose the readers. What i wanted was not to make my readers loose there precious time pondering over what will load in.)<br /><br />So all the ideas still remain spread over notepad. From the day IPL has started, i have found <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">no time for 'nothing'</span>. And as i could <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">never</span> do <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">nothing</span>, i could find <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">no time for anything</span> but IPL. Hence i wish IPL ends soon so that i can get back to my state of <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">nothingness</span> in the evenings. Then i would have ample time for doing '<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">nothing</span>' so that i would be able to do many things.<br /><br />I know this post is of no sense at all. Still it does bring in an interesting thought to ponder over:<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">No time for 'nothing' means no time for anything</span><br /></div></div>\n",

Each time i see the same old blog posts, i thought i need to motivate myself to start writing again. I tried everything. First thought of all the possible random, 'scribble'able points, came up with many and forgot about almost all of them, unpenned.

I think you need to predict harsh facts to be biggies. Doesn't matter if they go wrong. That will further elevate my predictions and in turn my biggie status.)</li><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">My untouched list of sources linkable to the Global Warming</span> (This topic is on my hot list. My only concern is i lose atleast one bullet point from the list with each passing day. No surprises, as the global warming topic itself is warmed more than the warming earth. I fear the debatable issues have more threat of extinction than earth)</li><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">My innovative ways to save our dear planet \"earth\"</span> (Save as in save from so called Global Warming. Not save as in save from getting thrown out of solar system. Though i don't want to post more of this, but few interesting questions did rise in my mind. If we threw Pluto out, where did the poor little chap go? Do the \"Pluto\" ions know that they are not the part of our solar system? Is our solar system their solar system or do they milk some other milky way? I guess i should stop here.)</li><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">My view of our universe</span> (\"There was no big bang. There are no laws. There are no forces. There are no planets, no stars, no solar systems. There is no light. It's just HIM. Unrevealing this summer\" Are you still expecting something more? Dude.. thats all you get in a \"Teaser\", you see :P)</li></ul>\n\nAll of the above, though being pretty random, just couldn't motivate me.

As i sit acting idle, with feeling rather unsuccessful with my attempts to follow \"<a href=\"http://elatedamit.blogspot.com/2008/01/operation-afraid.html\">Operation Afraid</a>\", i start scanning my social appearance at Orkut. (P.S. I did succeed in beating one dreaded task. Successfully washed the clothes, a task no less than a feat. Though the fear of uncompleteness did keep me away from taking a bath and shaving. You see victory ask for persistent efforts :P) And along my stroll, I  again dashed into a place i find the most meaningless. The Communities.<br /><br />I always thought that it should be wrong to say that i completely hate them. The fact that i myself have joined around 50 communities should signify that. But then it was today i thought to drill into my communities' choice. And then rose the truth. All the communities i have joined can largely be divided into following categories:<br /></div>\n\n<ul style=\"text-align:justify;\"><li>Ones i joined as a newbie, similar to a kiddie thrown into a toy shop picking random toys</li><li>Ones which i was forced to join with an ultimatum of sort \"Join now\" ('or you will be hanged alive' was always silent :P)</li><li>Ones wherein you just feel great to be part of. It hardly matters how much sense it makes in you joining them</li></ul>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">And it was then i realized that communities are indeed quite a boring and meaningless places to be in. More meaningless than boring. Include one more of <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">ones which i created</span> and I guess we have the categories generic enough to include the whole 'orkut'ers. First, it hardly has any sensible activity going on. (One can surely not mark people proving themselves to be superior by posting last or naming there predecessor or playing jokers as sensible.) Secondly, thanks to the first point and the second and third category, it hardly reflects what the person's interest really are. So a weirdo playing a \"Rate the person above you\" game in C++ community places him straight into the third category just in for senseless fun.<br /><br />Moreover mostly are the occasions wherein the common interest projected itself is quite confusing. There are majority just to display one's liking for <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">blah blah</span> singer, writer, director, actor, books, sports-persons, nations, places and every such namable entity. For each one mentioned above there is an anti-community of haters. Each one of these have various levels of followers: country wise, state wise, city wise, university wise and the digging just goes on. Then there are those which say they exists for common purpose like \"spreading happiness\", \"cutting sorrows\", \"making healthy\", \"shit happens: you are not alone\" and bhah blah. And finally those which are quite weird which do make you raise your eyebrows. Few to mention \"I hate orkut\" (wouldn't it be a good idea to group such interesting people in Facebook) or \"Announce new orkut communities\" (Community with a goal to promote other community?? how innovative) or \"Absurd Communities\" or \"I hate orkut communities\" (need i say anything??). How i wished to be innovative enough to come up with something so fascinating and new. No wonder each community has atleast a single copy with equal number of members.<br /><br />Anyways whatever i say, they do exists and exists with thunderous activities. I know i do have missed to crown many others which indeed need a mention. But then considering the vastness of this community world, i dare you try that out! </div>\n",

If i was made dada, manu etc at home, each one followed that up by gawande, amit, amith (southernized), wasudeo (!!! thats my father's name. Isn't that ironic that it was called when i wanted it to be the least, while distributing the  checked answer sheets), strato, gaws and recently to few more.  I felt like a bot in quake3 arena getting named for each player. Yeah!! as if this wasn't enuf i myself tagged myself with \"the great\", \"the warrior\", \"gaws\", \"gamer\" and simply \"the player\" in gaming arena. But there was the one that kept following me and i dreaded the most. \"Phattu\" (meaning \"the fearful\". Quite interesting isn't it? I feared the name itself). Though i felt it wasn't fare enough, I feared the things every normal one did. And if someone didn't i always felt he should be called the fearfree (physo??? :P).<br /><br />Anyways today it was just by chance that i thought why not untie this tag from myself. But the first step was to list down the things i feel i fear the most in recent time. Because the countless times i was afraid is the past now and past hardly counts. So here goes the list of my recent 'fearmakers':<br /><br />1) <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Weekends:</span> Yep. These dudes come with a promise to let me complete all my jobs i have been postponing to meet just to slide under my feet with a lighting speed keeping me awake every sunday night. And thats the night i go to sleep with mostly zilch completed. Few uncompleted jobs include random internet surfs, itemized jobs like meeting, following up with XYZ, completing uncompleted work over the weekdays, do some shopping, paying bills, calling someone and and... Uff the list really goes on. Few which always top the list and remain unbeaten include washing clothes and shaving. Its all because i keep fearing each one of them, i hardly take a bath on sunday. You see i hardly find any time. Facing the monday morning with every planned thing untouched shivers me up.<br />2) <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">News reports boasting someone:</span> It may seem its fully <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">faltu</span> to fear something so stupid. But boss you should watch news channels catching random roaming people and making them comment on <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">blah blah</span> attaining <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">blah</span> feat. And then follow the unending murmurs: \"East or West blah blah is best\", \"Blah blah is great\", \"we love u blah blah\", \"i feel in todays world .... hjhsdjsa.... sjdhsaj\" (a sudden break from news reporter finally breaks his non-abating tempo). I fear heavily that one day it would be me who would end up on either side of the conversation: i mean either boasting someone or holding mic (Nah me getting boasted over a news channel seems hardly probable. Though the speed with which news channels are turning insane, the possibility cannot be negated. And believe me, that would be no less fearful)<br />3) <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Reality shows and SMS:</span> I don't know if the show producers really know that but sending an SMS here at our place does get charged. But lemme be clear. No horror serial/movie isn't as horrifying as these shows. I really worry if i keep on watching the reality shows, time's not far when i would unknowingly type \"&amp;*&amp;* A\" or <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\"LEAD #\" and send that to 56789. Lines are open from saturday 10</span>.... Arggghhh You see the side-effect. It just sticks and stinks inside. And even unknowingly you start blabbering the rules. Now thats the fear.<br />4) <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Google Homepage: </span>Seemingly harmless bot, this is the most dreadful thing among the lot. I myself feel am addicted to this dude now. After atleast every 1 hour of joblessness, I feel to face this faceless creature. I fear he would one day take over my mind one day and and spread his crawler bots to digg out the information hidden inside. The phrase (and widely used \"About me\" statement in social profiles) \"My mind is an open book\" would literally turn into \"My mind is an open searchable entity. Just google it dude\". Its really scary.<br /><br />I guess i should stop for now. Its the Sunday night, have just seen an episode of reality show, been targeted by the boasting news reports recently and just now ebbed myself my visiting google.com. So before I really get bogged down by fear, let me reveal the plan. Plan is i am going to not fear any of these things. Simple solutions is not watch television, no web surfing (surfing without googling??? Just can't imagine) and yep no work postponement. I know that's pretty 'new year resolutions'ish type of statements, but a start need to be made. Once i regain my control over these things, i will move to few other fearmakers. <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Till then good night. Its me signing off for tonight</span>.<span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> Will meet next Sunday same time</span> .. Argghhhh need to sleep. Fearmakers on their way!!!<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Update:</span>As if the \"Google\" fear i talked about earlier wasn't enough, there struck this video which intensified this fearmakers effect on my \"blogged\" mind. Thats quite creepy.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>\n\n<p style=\"font-size:8px;text-align:right;\">Blogged with <a href=\"http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock\" title=\"Flock\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flock</a></p>\n",

But then thats what comes to my mind whenever they yell \"Laughter is the best medicine\". So if thats the case, why pretend that its not sold in the medical stores? It is indeed sold by a lot of agents, with political leaders leading the race followed by the so called \"Blah-Blah Rights Protection\" buffs. Anyways thats not the purpose of this post's existence (Hmmm ... Interesting!!). Why this post lie here has its own insight.<br /><br />Along my stroll down the web's spider lane, I came across an article \"<a href=\"http://ririanproject.com/2007/10/26/10-benefits-of-laughter-and-how-to-use-it/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to &quot;10 Benefits of Laughter, and How to Use It&quot;\">10 Benefits of Laughter, and How to Use It</a>\". Triggered my weird thoughts. As each point scanned under my eyes, my mind blogged through the idiotic wanderings. \"Why\"'s and \"What if\"'s started cracking under my skull. And the only way to abate that was to pen it down. So here goes the autopsy....<br /><br />Imagine a comment from a person something like \"Buddy, i finally reduced the level of cortisol, epinephrine, adrenaline and dopamine man. Been long since i laughed.\" I mean may be thats true, but is there any need to know that? How does that matter which '-ol' or '-ine' i reduce. Really makes me think why do these dudes have to break down something simple like \"Stress level\" to all these '-ine's. Put it simple yaar. \"Laughter reduces stress level\" and one doesn't require any scientist to tell him that. Its instinctive.<br /><br />Plus they say laughter is a great workout. Okie, point taken. So from tomorrow onwards i will go to gym and break into a huge roar of laughter. Being highly contagious as they say, it won't take long to spread all through the company. Now come the two threads from Butterfly effect which my life can take.<br /></div>\n\n<ul><li>It instills the positive mind frame in all the employees. And similarly all the city dwellers and finally to the whole country and then comes world. I win Noble prize for spreading happiness all around.<br /></li><li>Employees feel a complete physical release of tensions and all deadlines are forgotten. The behaviour spreads to the country and i am charged with contempt. I find the scientist who did this research and kill him. I am hanged.</li></ul>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Moreover a research suggests that optimistic (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">where's the connection with laughter dude?</span>) people live healthy and longer. Now thats obvious. An optimist would never say \"I have got cancer buddy\". Rather he would insist its a kind of a roller ball running round his stomach providing him guffaws. So never would you see him saying he is ill. Thats it. He is healthier for the world.<br /><br />Anyways fun apart, one point does hit the bull's eye. A smile costs absolutely nothing. So why not spread it on the face. I just wear it on and live on. Without really caring if it does benefit me or not. But one thing is for sure. It does spread some kind of freshness to one's mind and to the face.  So cut the crap buddy and spread the smile. <a href=\"http://elatedamit.blogspot.com/2007/05/talk-universal-language.html\">It does make difference</a>!!!<br /></div>\n",

Throughout my life, from a tender age when i was railing on my knees, I have never been a \"Frutomaniac\". I mean i have never been an idiotic fruits lover. When kiddies around me were busy drooling over all sorts of fruits, i was busy enjoying fats. Parents kept forcing me to push fruits in myself and i kept on running away making faces and crying like hell. And as always, the childish weeping bomb won over the parental force. And as i grew up, i was installed with an image for each fruit i was made to eat, forcibly. Follows the list (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Don't expect this list to be exhaustive. If you do, stop eating fruits and go visit a doctor</span>)<br /></div>\n\n<ul><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Custard Apple</span>: This is the one who i met earliest.  And as i visualize this guy, up stands the Tom Hanks from \"Forrest Gump\". Poor Chap who everybody just rips apart and relish. Hence goes my sympathies with this rusty.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Orange</span>: This guy stands as one of the protagonists from any of the \"American Pie\" series. I mean he is all time dressed up just to get undressed. Capable of bring tears rolling down even with its peels. And a simple aim in life; lose his virginity (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">remember how you undress an orange with your thumb :P</span>)</li><li><font face=\"arial\" size=\"2\">Pomegranate</font>: Here come another rusty guy. But he is by no means the sympathy earning one. I mean, to start with, its no child's play to name and start relishing him. Even if you if do open him up, he starts poking his seeds in your tooth cavities; once his choco mate has played its part.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Watermelon</span>: The chubby fat dumb a**. His black seeds depicting his face with pimples all over. As expected he has to be juicy. And its enough to drivel along your arms over your shirt. I never remember me <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">mating </span>him with my shirt over.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Mango</span>: The dude in the gang. Luck has always favored this guy unlike the poor custard apple. He is smart, he is rich, smells and tastes heaven. In short has all the qualities that can draw any female counter part in the fruit fraternity crazy. The news is he is dating <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Banana </span>these days, you know that stripper round the corner. Yep the same fair chick ;)</li><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Apple</span>: And finally comes the most opportune guy among them all. Reasons unknown, this brat runs along every corner right from the mommy's kitchen (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Apple pie, which is mostly without any 'apple'ish touch</span>) to the Doc's clinic (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">An Apple a day ... the real interpretation follows</span>). I mean he does hardly anything to earn fame. But sometimes its just divine providence and hence he earned the blog title too.</li></ul>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Thats just a small list of chaps who have significant thrust over my memory. There are many others like the ugly fat jackfruit or the sexy berries or the fearful grapes or the sleepy papaya. But then these don't stand enough ground.<br /><br />And before I end the post, lemme just clarify one thing. There is more as to why Apple earned the title here than just his fortune. For last few days, i have been made to eat apple daily claiming that \"An apple a day keeps the doctor away\". Its been just two weeks or so, and lemme assure you one thing. An apple a day does have guts enough to keep anyone away. Doc was just the poor guy who fell into the trap!!!<br /> </div>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:right;font-size:8px;\">Blogged with <a href=\"http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock\" title=\"Flock\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flock</a></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Blank... Thats how i have been for almost a week now. Truly speaking work apart, life's really following a pattern. 'Pattern' itself is trying to poke its head out of the blogged mind, but will somehow prevent it from doing so for a bit.<br /><br />This post of mine is more of a \"puch\" to my blog. It has been throwing the same faces at me for more than a week now. It looked totally rusted, highly demanding a post. So thought lemme push down what i have been doing for a while. So the pattern goes something like this...<br /></div>\n\n<ul><li>Come to office : Is it really a step?? Though the efforts required does make it one.<br /></li><li>Check mails : Doesn't matter even if i did it just before i left for office. Thats how work dawns at me<br /></li><li>Remain updated with my social contacts : Name sounds big. In simple words, i look at my un-updated profile again searching for new updates. Even a look at lame updates from friends would do<br /></li><li>Get coffee : Dude, it draws one fresh. Makes me totally ready for work</li><li>Start Working and keep working : Works always there boss. But all work can make one a turtle head in an office. So simultaneous tasks include keeping an eye on notifications from Outlook, Gtalk, feed readers, communicator, fellow workers and \"hope they were my fellow workers\" types. By the way, a basic click continues. Check mails and social networks!!!<br /></li><li>Lunch : Have to take it boss. Can't jump over it. I can give my 100% only when my tummy stays 100%.</li><li>Scribble about everything : \"Why just aloo/paneer?\" \"Need a small nap yaar!!\" \"Boss i shouldn't have filled my tummy 100%. It really makes work difficult!!! [<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">paradox???</span>]\" \"Oh wow.. Man I never get a chance to praise beauty. Is it me who choices the wrong places to fall in or its just my luck that throws me in??? [<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Men will be men ;)</span>]\" <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">And when i do think this is getting too out of work context, only the scribble context change</span> \"Tomcat sucks big time man!!!\" \"Eclipse slows like damn dude\" \"Uhhh my system needs a dose buddy!!\" And as this continues ...</li><li>Get Coffee : One has to get fed up. Nothing works in noon. Coffee has to make me fresh</li><li>Start Working and keep working : Work again. And stays the simultaneous threads. Just that an another thread with look at the clock gets added. And as EOD arrives...<br /></li><li>Check mails and Social Networks : I do it only twice. Once in the morning and again in the evening. Anyways no one mails. So why waste time checking mails. (An inner thought cries \"Uhh still no mails.. no scraps\")</li><li>Leave Office: I have a common statement to end my day daily \"Today's was the worst day mate. Nothing worked yaar!!!\" Scribbling continues.... </li></ul>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">And as i end this post, an instant thought strikes. Does any software engineer spends a routine even an inch different than this one? Out comes the answer, obviously yes. Afterall every software engineer has new scribbles to scribble and new notification to look at. Also not everyone drinks coffee ....<br /><br />[<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">PS: Though the above mentioned steps seem bulky, but they hardly take 5 % of my working time. Reasons are simple. I hardly get any checkable mails or replyable scraps or readable feeds. Moreover work does succeed to pull me in</span>]<br /><br />By the way, follows a nice video on juggling. It does provide another work synchronized thread, a look at \"Buffering ...\"<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">As a follow-up to an earlier post titled <a href=\"http://elatedamit.blogspot.com/2007/07/quality-confidus-for-softwares.html\">'Quality Confidus'</a>, here goes another one. The theme for this was bubbling in my mind right from the day this lack of confidence for quality came to my notice. But the world is too full with nonsensical stuff to let you think about anything else. So this time round just closed my thought radar and blogged this post first.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://elatedamit.blogspot.com/2007/09/software-programmers-panico.html\"><img style=\"display:block;text-align:right;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http://bp1.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/RvTIsEYvvtI/AAAAAAAAAto/zdMndVNnG6A/s320/SP2.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>So the story goes like this. This whole lack of confidence among the software programmers and managerial \"<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">stuff</span>\" makes me wonder how really a programmers life is (Are managers really human? Am a bit skeptic about this fact. So let us call them stuff for now). I mean, thanks to this whole <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Bug-Raga</span> that rings in their ears day round, the time is not far when we may see a conversation sort as follows:<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">SP2</span>: What the heck? Are you serious?<br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">SP1:</span> Yeah man. I am really worried now. And confused too! Really i don't know how this happened<br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">SP2:</span> Did you try resolving the issue. I mean try adding some stubs in code dude.<br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">SP1:</span> Did everything buddy. But its still the same. I don't know what will <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Emailo say. (Emailo is the manager 'stuff'. I hope it does ring some bells)</span><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">SP2:</span> Yeah. You have to work on this crisis. No one else can help and you know that. By the way what were you trying to do?<br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">SP1:</span> See nothing complex of sort. I had to <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">blah blah blah. </span>So what i did was i created a class extending <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">blah</span> and implementing <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">blah</span> with <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">blah</span> method overridden. Then i created a static object for <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">blah blah blah</span>.... <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(Thats what SP2 interpreted)</span><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">SP2:</span> Ya got that. Dude that indeed is not that complex <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(Thats called Geekology!!!). </span>I know you will resolve this soon. But lemme tell you one thing. You have to come out of this mess soon. Because <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Emailo</span> will think otherwise that you are not giving your 100% <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(Though everyone knows thats the truth.

				"content_text": "<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Been on watch for something interesting. And there came two strolling down. Its like asking for Halle and earning Serena and Venus together. But anyways as i have got them now, let me show some respect to both.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://elatedamit.blogspot.com/2007/09/global-warming-culprits-cows-and.html\"><img style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http://bp0.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/RuQo-g9UOuI/AAAAAAAAAsc/AsRUfcibCrQ/s400/pigeons_goto.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>So crawling round the web I came across two interesting stories. Everything has to do with the mind blogging and ever growing <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">globally warmed</span> issue(/fiasco??) of <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">global warming</span>. I feel scientist are too bored to pull out new points to discuss when everything has really been cut open. There are few great \"<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">humanophobic</span>\"s who really are  after the human race to end themselves, so that there future generations can live long in peace (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Quite weird huh. Where the heck will future generation fall from? As far as my knowledge goes, technology there with Souls hasn't reached the height to pull out humans from themselves. Or has it?</span> <a href=\"http://elatedamit.blogspot.com/2007/06/smoking-n-choking-out.html\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Don't think so</span></a>). While there are other mankind lovers who just believe that we, the humans, can never trouble others (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">pretty optimistic boss</span>). So there go the stories possibly scripted by these mankind maniacs.<br /><br />Let us look at the first one. Its about the  <a href=\"http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/08/03/bridgetec_tec.html?category=technology&amp;guid=20070803140030\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">failed interstate bridge over the Mississippi River</a>. The inspectors believe that pigeons played a tantamount role in bringing it down along with heavy traffic, missing bolts and cracking steel. It seems these fatty pigeons out there in Mississippi go on and on shitting along the bridge, that too without wearing diapers, thinking it to be the government provided pigeon-open latrines. And its this <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">dung</span> that corroded the bridge and made it weaker killing tens. Chances are that this dung will kill many others at different locations. So its the pigeons who torture and trouble others and not the human. Man-kind maniacs score one. Catch the story here:<br /></div>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/08/23/pigeons_ani.html?category=technology&amp;guid=20070823134500\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span class=\"primeColor\">Pigeon Dung: Menace to Bridges</span></span></a></li></ul>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">The second story directly hits the bulls eye at global warming. Some scientists believe now that cows may act as the protagonists in the global warming saga. (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Dude, are you bored with humans now. Or are you trying to cash on the fact that there are no scientists or bloggers in cow fraternity?</span>) It is believed that as a <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">cow burps</span>, she throws out the methane gas, a powerful greenhouse agent (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">this name always makes me jump in my seat. Those bloody gases have got quite interesting name. Lucky them!!!</span>). Have a look at the story:<br /></div>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0816/p13s01-sten.html\">Lets make cows well mannered</a></li></ul>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">If you go through the report closely, there is one thing that will amaze every sensible man. And it is present in any report these days. Look at the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">height of depth</span> (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">crazy isn't it???</span>) the statistics go. 100 gallons of methane per cow per day and so on. Am really skeptic as to how they dig this data out. I mean, dude, 1 burp each 40 seconds? Uhhh give me a break.<br /><br />Anyways these stories may seem rather amusing and ludicrous. But they can affect the lives of these two cow-pigeon fraternity. Think how would be the environment out there among these poor buddies.

Be it Google, Apple, Ubuntu or Microsoft. One question would be why just these four? I would say they lead where they are. Anyways a general consensus is formed over work ethics and culture and innovation and customer satisfaction and <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">blah blah blah</span>. But I feel the reason lies somewhere in the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">logo</span> they hold. I thought if that was really the case, then one can surely see a statement from each of these biggies as follows:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://bp0.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/Rqbl3De4H1I/AAAAAAAAApE/1tEoYEUV8ow/s1600-h/google.jpg.gif\"><img style=\"float:right;cursor:pointer;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http://bp0.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/Rqbl3De4H1I/AAAAAAAAApE/1tEoYEUV8ow/s320/google.jpg.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Google</span>: \"Dude logos are important.

Truly speaking not something amazingly mind blogging<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">. </span>But I just kept scratching my bum over searching for the right word which i hardly could. So just replaced it with something <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">sensefull</span> and thought who cares. After all thats how new words are born and as an ardent user of English language its my even responsibility to add to its vast sea of gibberishes.<br /></div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><br />Ahh so backing to the topic, recently i heard about this<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> CMM5 quality guru</span> and an incident that happened with him. Forgive me I am bad at remembering the names. But anyways how does that really matter what you call him. In my senses lets say Mr D . This supposedly techie guy used to resurrect the importance of quality in software projects.  It so happened that D had this kiddish habit of forcing his listeners into some situations and then try screw them when they answer. However this time around he promoted himself to a sadistic charm. He had a group of project leads as his listeners. Yawny as they always are,  Mr D put them into a bit of critical situation. Here goes the conversation, obviously a spicy virtual one:<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Mr D:</span> Suppose you are boarding an aircraft which is a fully high tech one with Auto Pilot system, lights running all around, virtual air hostesses of shape and size of your choices. But the catch here is the whole software running is developed by your project group. There are no parachutes or any kind of emergency exit system. So in case your software fails, you rest in peace in your cosy container. Choice is yours; board the plane or pain your board.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Leads by now were pulled back to their senses. Seeing there life at stake, everyone hesitated to even walk in the aircraft. Their minds were running on a track somewhat as: \"What the heck. Dude am least comfortable with aircrafts running with software developed by these geeks under me. Who knows these bastards left some untied piece inside. I don't understand a shit and they don't give a damn.\" Actually speaking, Mr D was bubbling inside as this was his chance of scoring goal on quality. But suddenly a hand rose. Not only D but every single 'D'umbo inside was shocked.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Mr D:</span> Buddy lemme get it clear. Is it some kind of joke or you really are that confident. Dude this isn't something what i expected. Tell me how are you so confident with your team. What do you run for so much quality control. Speak up before everyone leaves this room and rush to book a call with you.<br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The One</span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(cool and yawny as always)</span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">: </span>Cool down man. Am least worried to board the aircraft. And I know nothing is gonna happen to me.  Rather I am not gonna go anywhere. Just for the simple reason that if the aircraft is build by my team, it can never take off. Engines would never kick off.\"<br /><br />Just a midget silence and the whole room roared up into a huge burst of laughter. It got virtually transfered to a ball room where no one except performer cares how he perform. Mr D needed hardly anything to prove his point.<br /><br />This whole lack of quality confidus (got something to do with confidence, but i though thats not the perfect word ;) may rise to a level which would lead to a new breed of IT conversations. I am dressing it up. It would rise soon. Something by the name: Programmer's Panico !!! Do hook up.<br /></div>\n",

				"title": "Google and Firefox drowns me in a mystery !!!",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">On my way while crawling the web, I noticed something which may be I was <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">inadvertent </span>to. I saw a time stamp next to the link which I opened. The screenshot below displays what i mean by that. I remember reading something along the same lines. But as i tried searching for a reference for the behavior, the efforts didn't throw success.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://bp3.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/Ro5PTSSuwNI/AAAAAAAAAog/KLQp1wKmb6g/s1600-h/gen.jpg\"><img style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http://bp3.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/Ro5PTSSuwNI/AAAAAAAAAog/KLQp1wKmb6g/s320/gen.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>However, the story doesn't end at this stage.  When I tried to playback the same in Internet Explorer, I was stunned to see no such behavior. So thinking that this has to do something with Firefox, I tried scanning other search engines for the display of time stamp, nothing really happen. So bulged a question. Is this behavior related with Google searches in Firefox? If so, whats so different in Firefox than IE? Moreover I am using the latest updated versions of both. I even tested it on a fresh version of Firefox. So i assumed it has least to do with mozilla extensions.<br /><br />As if these questions weren't enough, something more happened that assisted the assumptions. As i deleted the cookies, I wasn't that <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">hoo-haa </span>seeing no stamp. But what baffled me was I was unable to redraw the same behavior.<br /><br />So another question popped up in my mind. Does Google have some playing hours on internet, when they just put in some behavior into there search and pop it out as soon as they test it? Mozilla couldn't do that because thats something that resides on my system. And if it does put something without my consent, I see some good time ahead of me. Anyways currently I have employed myself to demystify this abruptness.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Update: </span>One thought each one gets first is about add-ons in mozilla. But as i mentioned, I tested it out with a fresh version of firefox without any extensions too. So addons have zilch part to play. Moreover the abrupt display and hiding of the time stamp continues now too.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Update2:</span> After a lot of trial and errors and with the help of a very useful comment by <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">whoblah</span>, i was able to understand the behavior. Rather i shouldn't call it a mystery as it really wasn't. It was just an ignorance on my part. Thought let me reveal the solution because there is possibility that there would be many others ignorant enough. In nutshell, the issue has to do with Google's web history, where in for the above behavior to work, one needs to be logged into his Google account. If you are, you can see the complete history about when and how many times have you opened a particular link from Google search. So don't panic if you ever see a time stamp next to the search. Thats Google history at work!!!<br /></div></div></div>\n",

One sits at his desk, gazing at his clock arms strolling round its face. Just when he is completely down; about to dream his imaginations, a sudden buzz of <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\"Hi\"</span> rises at the south-east end of his desktop. A smile props up at his face thinking <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">'Thanks buddy for a bit of relief'</span>.  And suddenly something happens and he, the savior, is gone with his work done. You sit there stunned, trying to grasp what really stormed out. But plain abortive attempts! Incidents like these have happened with me many times now. Just another similar incident and i thought there is an exigent need to decrypt what the incoming messages really mean. So here i am penning down meanings of just a few abrupt messages which i have been decoding for quite sometime now ...<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">HI (all caps)</span> -  <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\"Look here u idiot... am too busy unlike u\"</span><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">hi </span>-<span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> \"am bored like hell ... and its a command u should talk to me.

May be not always do they convey the same meaning as stated. But then it goes for any decoded stuff boss. It's meaning is not always what it is decoded as. However, there are many others which are enthusiastically popping to get naked. But they just keep fluctuating there meanings even more often than <a href=\"http://elatedamit.blogspot.com/search/label/Bat%20n%20Ball\">Sachin Tendulkar</a>'s form. I am working part-time to decrypt those. Truly speaking, without really getting paid. Or am I? ;)</span><br /></div>\n",

Walking even though you own a car? Use Recycle Bags? Switch to a small cars from SUV's?<br /><br />I have heard all these things a zillion times now. After all, the only answer my mind shouted was \"Buddy, how does that matter. World's not worried, let me be imperturbable on this too.\" But then thought there are tons of other things i do perfunctory. To what extent does my following these things going to affect me. Not much really. So ... Anyways what is this carbon footprint and why the damn i should care? Why Singapore is looked after as a place following well thought solutions? <a href=\"http://www.ibnlive.com/videos/42284/special-citizens-for-earth--be-one.html\">IBN</a> does try and provide answers for these.<br /><br />Indeed what the video tries to convey does seem quite convincing. But just when I was about to bend my mind to digest this all, I was struck with a thought. I wondered are we, the humans, only protagonists in the so called global warming saga? Does CO2 emission by human have a significant threat to our environment? Is there any such global warming threat being seen? Are predictions of climate change perfect and not a mere prejudice?  Is it proved by experts that we are causing global warming? Is global warming really that bad? Will the money-gulping efforts to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions really stop climate from changing? Further, aren't they just bursting the state's budget? Rather, shouldn't money be flowing towards perennial and  pernicious threats? An <a href=\"http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=11548\">article published in <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">heartlander</span></a> does try and provide an answer to these all. What it concludes is to follow the call to the common sense and just put this \"Global Warming\" Scam to end.<br /><br />Further the movie below tries and put this whole saga under the name \"<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">a vested political interest creating panic</span>\" to turn more money towards climate science. CO2 indeed has very little to do with the climate change. I do feel even this view of scientists at other side of this scam needs to be looked at before we go and follow the call for morality.<br /><br /><br /><br />Then what is the path for me to follow? At the end, I find just trapped in yet another polemic. Unable to figure out, which way to lead myself!!!<br /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "<p align=\"justify\">\"Howdy\"!!! ... Thats how i was welcomed to the Wordpress' blogosphere. Frankly speaking, i got little freaked. Buddy, why this 'too-dudishness' ? Anyways, this blog of mine was more due to my urge to try out new options for what i already own (however, the urge doesn't show up for each thing i own). Backing to track, let blogger's eyes view wordpress....</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"> Yes, wordpress looks, or rather, is more organized than blogger. Nice options to manage one's space. Vision smoothening look. No Doubt, Ajax has worked hard to dress it up so well. Nice presentation choices including few elegant templates and useful widgets. Facility to create more than one pages. I did find this option interesting for it allows one to virtually transfer the blog into his website. Import and Export of posts and widgets. One's own uploading space. And last but not the least, a complete stat-pack providing all the required information about the reader and feed traffic on the blog. Yes, no need for all the foolish external widgets for tracking. Wish google understands this need of a blogger.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">But wait .... Hey, a bad editor and worst saving option. Am writing this part again when i already did it. Thanks to a you, Mr editor. Further, i feel these options are too many to for a novice to get hold of. And again, google scores where it always does. User Friendliness. Google knows what i want and where i want that. No wonder, blogging starts with Blogger. To illustrate, a user has to struggle here just to get his image inlined in his post. The reason why am writing this again with some weirdly placed images. Cudn't find any? Yeah i removed them for the weirdness they were incorporating in the post.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">To pack up, wordpress is a beautiful and elegantly designed blogger tool. But blogging is not as easy as compared to Blogger. Anyways, wish to put this space of mine to some use. Currently surfing my mind to reasonify this blog!!!</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/75e43a16d1.jpg\" /> <img src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2020/f33bf3ea41.jpg\" /> \n",

For me though, the silentness was pouring further dubiety in my already crowded mind. Crowded indeed it was, with anxiety n excitement n tons of questions. About to emerge was my first day in employee world; another significant turn in my life. And then there was that sudden roar. Silentness just boomed. In the park behind were few ages' bubbling with laughter, leaping and clinging each other, everyone trying his best to outdo everyone else. I could see dawn getting outrageous, looking at its lost soundlessness; like a gritty kid who has been denied a toy. Stood in front of me, a laughter club. Frankly speaking, i did find the whole raga rather funny. Each person trying to trouble oneself and catch one's breath. But little did i know what they were trying, was to change the world.<br /><br />The incident rose before me just a few days back when i learnt that as i was yawning in my bed at \"not-so-dawny\" time, there were few people who were celebrating a \"World Laughter Day\" on 6th May. Thought why not know something about this chapter in \"blah blah Day's\" Saga. What i found were many views on how laughter scientifically, spiritually, socially can make a person, and thus the world around him, better. Each view was clear enough to subscribe one to the thoughts.<br /><br /></div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.laughteryoga.org/world-laughter-day.php\"><img style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http://bp1.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/RkLI3kw7cNI/AAAAAAAAAG8/lp-XoKyIgME/s320/WLD-small.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>A question may arise why this sudden<span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> gyan</span> on laughter. Even i don't know the answer. But one thing needs to be marked. Do laugh off some part of your day. In fact, there is something happening deep inside you; fighting to make you better. And there are few who do believe you are <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">thus</span> adding to the world peace. So don't wonder if you face a bang on first Sunday of May. Just note its those few talking a universal language. Over-ambitiously!!!<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Anyways, follows a nice song \"Sadho Re\" by band <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Agnee</span> (First <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Jal</span>, Then <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Raeth</span> and now this one. I feel <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Yavu</span> is on its way). A striking song with beautiful lyrics. Why i place it here? I would say it speaks out today's world's unrest; which makes this peace-talk further important.<br /></div></div>\n\n<br /><br />[youtube=[www.youtube.com/watch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTc9EZi0nO8])\n",

In the front, a dark green gutter with water bubbling and scenting its way forward, welcomes him. Behind he sees a rock solid demented garbage. Numerous occasions has BMC tried to move it, but thanks to its insane determination, the garbage continues to zero all the BMC's efforts. Either sides provide a deserted plot, green as they are, all credit to the numerous organisms decomposing 'em off. So thanks to the hospital management's endeavors, patients have something to <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">green </span>about. Finally, thats what he requires the most.<br /><br />2) A shop-keeper on Hosur road has his shop named *7%^&amp; (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">this is something in Kannada, so couldn't understand that. A humble call, not to be misinterpreted with its usual meaning :D</span>) <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Tnasportions</span>. I feel, he just wanted to make it clear what his shop was about. Because he felt not everyone can make sense of something in Kannada. But English, boss its a universal language. I am still waiting to see it unclosed one day. Curious as i am about his work.<br /><br />3) Auto and truck drivers are really eager to know how a person following him looks; does he deserve following him or not. So a simple solution they found was to write \"Stop\" at their bum. Now, dignified persons as they are, they face a problem. After all, who likes others staring at their posterior. So what they do is just add an \"OK\" tag to tell, \"Enough gazing my rear boss.\"<br /><br />Enough answering unquestioned questions. There are few more answers waiting to burst out of my mind. But as of now, I am busy slanting my mind to digest these first.<br /></div>\n",

On numerous occasions have i seen the politicians using the law at their own will. Heating and bashing the law suits, molding them and coining as much money as possible. It doesn't matter even if they stroll over fortunes of thousands. The week saw two decisions taken by SC which do pour water on their motives. Quota dispute and the cauvery row have been the most vexed issues for some time. Cauvery issue though not that significant nation-wide, but i did find the verdict as really interesting. Honest disclosure, am not here to pass my judgment  over the issues. But really could not hold myself from lauding the SC's respective benches.<br /><br />Quota dispute has been one of the hottest topic of discussions over the last one year. The year saw huge rallies, protests and discussions among \"so-called\" leaders presenting (or rather forcing) their views. Nebulous were the intentions of the political parties; the restlessness of thousands of the youths following them, with a hope to get some respite. What was rather clear was that the decision cannot and should not be taken with 75 year old data as yardstick. And thats what SC acquainted and slapped Center Government to \"determine who <span><span class=\"f12\">is socially and economically backward\". OBC quota gets a stay order, with aspiring students getting a bit of relief. Observation of the bench was \"</span></span><span><span class=\"f12\">Reservation cannot be permanent and appear to perpetuate backwardness\". </span></span><span><span class=\"f12\">Harsh </span></span><span><span class=\"f12\">though</span></span><span><span class=\"f12\">, but true to the core. </span></span><span><span class=\"f12\">What I further fancied was the SC's verdict for center's plea to vacate the stay order. Slammed was the government \"to stop playing the game first and then framing the rules\". This was a proper slap to the self-centered politicians trying to cash the issue during the elections. Way to go, Division Bench!!!</span></span><br /><br /><span><span class=\"f12\">Cauvery verdict has also seen huge protests in the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu post HC decision. SC passed a verdict asking CM's of the two states to show some \"Statesmanship\". A simple reason was stated that \"any order passed is bound to trigger protests in the aggrieved </span></span><span><span class=\"f12\">states\". </span></span><span><span class=\"f12\">Not only have the bench members refrained from deciding the fortune of the debated dispute but also provided an option to confront the nation wide water-scarcity issue. Hope the \"Statesmen\" do understand the humble intentions.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span class=\"f12\">Both the verdicts are indeed wake-up calls for the politicians. But what i fear is that the problem is still far away from being solved. Center's not ready to give up the quota issue so easily, eying the elections. IIMs are still not clear on how to carry the admission process forward. Students stand midway, confused, staring at their hazy future. Our politicians are engrossed completely in debating what literally statesmanship is. And We, the mute and deaf people, are  busy blabbering and listening to our Mp3's. Paradoxical Indeed!!!</span></span><br /></div>\n",

Corporate world has indeed made me dry. Juiceless. Deprived of whatever fun element I had in my life. Saw the wetted earth today and there loomed the childhood days in front of me.<br /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><br />Those hours I spent sitting on a sofa employing my eyes out at rain beaten roads. \"Chai-Bhajji\" or \"Pohe\" that i relished. Slightest sound of a rain drop that made me run towards the porch. Spellbound eyes of mine that tried to gulp up a sight of lush green fields. An enchanting effect that even a midget breeze created. The restlessness that a sight of river or even a small stream gave me. The dew-laden grass plates that endorsed the mesmerizing capacity of the nature. \"Aai\" who always dabbed me forcefully in the sweater and monkey-cap. Soothing effect that the cooler-chilled room created after returning from burning heat. Glasses of Rasna i gobbled. Waits for the \"Chachaji-Sabu-Raka\" Combo. Exchanges of comics and greedily moving through the pages, just to make sure we read the most. Carrom Games, Cards, Cricket matches that we played, ignorant of screeching sun, blowing winter or pouring rains. Dirty clothes that i washed so as to keep \"aai\" unaware of mud-ridden football matches. And the list just goes on, endless. I never knew what really allured me so strongly. But I do was.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">And today, here I am looking at the rain-hit porch from my AC cubical. Without a sofa, \"Pohe\"or \"Chai Bhajji\". Drops kept pouring, waiting for me to run into the porch. Lush-green lawn's spread out there, just to make me spellbound again. Gone are the rivers/streams and am in the middle of bulk of fountains. But these don't make me restless. \"Aai Daddy\" are there, always at the other end of phone line. Mirinda can't take the place rasna holds. Dan Brown or Sidney Sheldon can't surrogate \"Raj or Diamond\". \"Batman-Superman\" can easily be kneeled down by \"Druv-Nagraj\". Gone are the games. Gone are the friends. Gone are the fun-filled days. Nature's still out there. Calling me. Waiting to mesmerize me. With me completely oblivious.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Thanks a lot, corporate world.

But these are not demands for victory, nor the expectations that come from thinly veiled jealousy over how much money India's cricketers make. Instead, this is a call to a skilful and talented bunch of individuals to do what they do best. It is a cry for the class of 2007 to reduce cricket to what it is really about - bat and ball. Only that can heal the soul of a game that's been thrown into torment. Only that can give India the best chance of winning and, in the event that they do not, lend strength to the calls for restraint that will inevitably follow.\"<br /><br />-By Anand Vasu<br />(For complete story visit: <a href=\"http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/ci/content/current/story/286790.html\">India's biggest battle will be in the mind</a>)</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Utterly ready to start my trip to pune, the unstable mind, as usual, was not able to stick to a plan for the day. Breakfast first or office first? Where? What to have? What about the lunch? Lunch or just snacks? Questions started blogging my mind. Finally stabling down to a bakery, had a samosa   and gave away whatever change I had (again with unstability, shall I or shall I not). Completely oblivious of what's in store next, I hired an auto with just 100's and 500's with me. Finally was caught up in a \"not-so-dissimilar\" situation. Started the usual cry. \"Sir, change do. Itne sabere hum kahan se layenge change. Tumko malum hona. Samajhta nahi kya\".<br /><br />I know i did do a mistake by not keeping the change with me, but what i didn't know was i did a blunder by not knowing that 10 bucks are considered as change. He was calling me a fool and i had no choice but to accept silently  that i am one. Then I thought thats not a big deal. Not him, then someone else would have fooled me out. So simply nodding in acceptance for what he said, I just  walked off. A thought just scribbled my mind, days are not far when a man will be called a fool for giving beggar a 10 rupee note.  For \"Chutta\" would have its value raised, with 10 bucks no longer being considered as change. A \"Beggar's delight\" or rather \"Beggar's dismay\"? Random thought though, but unanswered.<br /></div>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I always come up with a statement &ldquo;Sachin is not a Match Winner&rdquo;.

So is &ldquo;Match Winner&rdquo; the one who stays till the end? If that&rsquo;s the case then Srinath and Kumble were the match winners in the 3rd match of Titan Cup played against Australia on 21st October 1996. But still the man of the match award was given to the Sachin. Because he was holding one end of the indian innings when the greats like Dravid, Ganguly and Azar were making their way to pavalion. He was sailing India home with a great victory but for a good ball which he just happened to misjudge. This was the innings that created a base for the &ldquo;rare&rdquo; nice flicks from the two Bangaloreans and made them to take India to a fantastic win and they get full credit for doing it with perfection.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now lets consider a Test Match. Take the 2nd test of the Border-Gavaskar trophy played against Australia on 26-30 December 1999. The first innings of Australia saw 405 runs. Thanks to great innings by Slater, Langer, Gilchrist and even some fine knocks by Fleming and Lee down the order. India&rsquo;s 1st innings score was 238 which had a fine inning of 116 from the Little Master. He was the 9th man to get out. Then Australia scored 208 runs before declaring their second innings. In the responce, India just managed to score 195 runs again having an inning of 52 from Tendulkar. But then he could not sail india to victory at last. Still the man of the match was given to him. Can we imply from this test that Sachin was not a match winner as he didn&rsquo;t won the test for india? No we can&rsquo;t!!!!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But then you again can&rsquo;t say that Sachin was the match winner in the First match we discussed. No he wasn&rsquo;t. On the contrary, no one can be a match winner in a team game like Cricket. You cannot neglect the support he got from Jadeja and Mongia that helped him to to take india on the verge of a win and then the nice flicks from Srinath and Kumble that sailed India to victory. You cannot forget even a small contribution of 30 odd runs in Cricket because that, with a partnership, counts big. Even in case of the test discussed, same thing would have happened if sachin would have got some support from his fellow teammates. The fault was not Sachin&rsquo;s — it was just that India could not find a Fleming/Lee who could score some runs down the order in the first innings.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->People may query &ldquo;why are you just considering these two innings?&rdquo; Or may be something like &ldquo;You are getting biased&rdquo;. But then I am not discussing the greatness of Sachin. I am just trying to judge the statement about match winner concept which I totally disbelieve exists. I think these facts are good enough to prove that the fist two issues can be discarded when you say he is not the match winner and very well answer the two questions we developed.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So lets move to 3rd and 4th issues. I think these don&rsquo;t need to be discussed seperately as they are too similar. No situation can be more crucial than the final of a series. Here i will just like to ask one simple question. How many of these finals would india have reached but for Sachin? Does it not take some fine performances to win the matches which take us to the final? C&rsquo;mon man. After all he is an human being who too has got limits. Nobody in the world can be perfect and neither is Sachin. But the mere fact that he doesn&rsquo;t play in finals unlike few others (not Indians offcourse because i guess no indians play well in finals) doesn&rsquo;t reduce his briliance.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Or it can again not imply/disprove that he is not a match winner.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The fifth query can be considered in two parts. 1) On Batsmen friendly pitches: Ok then i think this is a part of the game. Sachin is a batsmen and every batsmen is considered to play well on batsmen friendly pitches. But it will be wrong to say that he plays only on batsmen friendly tracks. Because he do have a few innings under his belt to disprove this statement including the ones at bulawayo and johannesburg against Zim and SA. Lets move to second part.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2)On Indian pithces: This statement will be best judged by few statistics which I will soon come up with.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lets move to the last and the most important comment. He is obviously not like Waugh, Lara, Inzi. He is far ahead of Waugh and Inzi and in case of Lara, I will just say its better not to judge one greats performance in the vision of the others. But I can say one thing. Sachin may not be a Steve Waugh but then he does not have a Warne, Gillespie or Lee who could win a match by hitting the last few runs after he scores a century. Lara and Waugh both had great teams to back their efforts, not just a few good players like what Sachin has. Tendulkar has shone as the lone gladiator for India.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I think everybody should stop worrying about who is a batter match winner and enjoy the game of all the greats. One thing is for sure. Today, when Sachin goes out to bat, he has over a billion people praying for him. So, whether he is a MATCH-WINNER or not, who cares: he is a HEART-WINNER. Today&rsquo;s great moments are tommorow&rsquo;s sweet memories. Though Dravid might be &ldquo;the great WALL of India&rdquo;, if you look beyond the wall you can see a monument, an &ldquo;Unconquerable Everest&rdquo;, in Sachin Tendulkar.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the end, I would just like to put a plain request to all those who debate on this topic. Just leave the man, who has given 14 years of his life to his passion, alone and don&rsquo;t put him under a microscope. This will sure help you enjoy the numerous innings he had played and the numerous he is yet to play. I CONGRATS THE LITTLE MASTER for all the fine innings he has played and wish him all the best for his remaining carrier. So bowlers beware.
