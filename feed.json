				"content_html": "<p>For the past few years, Micro.blog has hosted this blog. Every year, I revisit that decision to verify if it still is the best choice for me. I did that last year. And I did the year before. Every time, I have decided to stick to this wonderful platform. Unlike earlier, when I made such decisions by listing pros and cons, the last two times I made it based on my experience of using the other services over a year.</p>\n<p>I have recently read a lot of people revisiting their choices of platforms and thought I should share about my experiments.

This post is for the experiments since then.</p>\n<p>Before that, here&rsquo;s a quick note on how I give myself time to arrive at this decision. <em>I have never changed my primary platform</em>. I sign up for an annual plan with a service, set it on a custom sub-domain and use it for a full year. Sure, it&rsquo;s a costly option.

Anyway, onto my experiments.</p>\n<p>In 2022, I was fascinated by what Ghost promised as a platform. It was well-reviewed, polished and highly recommended. It suited the long-form style of writing I wanted to do more of. It had a built-in newsletter. I wanted all of that. The question was, can it become my primary blogging platform. A year of continuous usage convinced me it wasn&rsquo;t. Though I liked what it offered, it didn&rsquo;t fit my style of writing. I am very informal in what I write. Sometimes, it is heartfelt life stories. Other times, it&rsquo;s meaningless updates. More often, it&rsquo;s the latter. Ghost isn&rsquo;t a right fit for such posts.</p>\n<p>For starters, it continues to need a title. And images. It wants me to play around with the metadata of the post. Before I can publish a post, all the bells and whistles distract me and I start to question if my words are worth all this polish. That&rsquo;s not the feeling I want when I am about to click publish. It limits what I can do with the styling. Even the paid plan has a very limited selection of themes.

Unlike Ghost, its plans are simple &ndash; so I again signed up for an annual plan which unlocks all the paid features. Most importantly custom domain.

I could never write quick, short posts &ndash; it was that good.</p>\n<p>But there are significant downsides that I cannot brush aside. Adding images to posts isn&rsquo;t easy &ndash; need to go to a separate place to do that. The published posts look clean, but soulless. The options for styling are extremely limited. An ability to extend the capabilities is almost non-existent. The selection of good themes is negligible. The biggest problem of all is the publishing workflow, especially writing drafts, which is very frustrating. Drafts are posts published anonymously. But publishing them back to the main blog isn&rsquo;t intuitive. The published dates get all messed up.</p>\n<p>Also, I am not sure if the platform is in active development.

I was rushing for answers, justifications, and truths for the bulging crowd on why I wasn't at fault.\n\nSomeone touched my shoulder and said, \"In bhaisaab ka gaadi hain\". *It is this man's car.*\n\nI knew my justifications wouldn't work with this crowd. They wouldn't even give me a chance to tell the truth. A guy walked towards the sweating me. I fumbled, searching for the right first word. But before I could utter anything, I heard a voice. \"*Mera galti tha*. It was my mistake. I was driving fast, lost control of the bike and crashed into the back of this person's car. It wasn't his mistake.\"\n\nI heard a few audible sighs. The voice of a man who has just been in an accident and his admission of the mistake made the crowd lose all interest. \n\nAs the gathering started to dwindle, I breathed a sigh of relief. I walked to the guy and asked him if he was okay. I offered to take him to the hospital if he was hurt. He declined. Though scuffed at a lot of places, he was okay overall.\n\nStrangely, a few people left were getting restless again and hurling enquiries at the guy. I felt a hand on my shoulder. A man in his fifties leaned and whispered, \"*Saheb tumhi nigha ata*. You should leave now, sir. You shouldn't have stopped at all. Things could have gotten so out of hand.\"\n\nThough I was stunned at that moment by the heartlessness of this stranger's advice, deep down, I knew his remark had some merit.\n\nIn a world constantly on the verge of annoyance and hostility, was staying back when I knew everything was fine a mistake? I didn't have the courage that day to find the answer. After all, #life had to happen.\n",

And I also expect the pundits to pollute the internet again with their suggestions on the best ways to blog.\n\nThen, I went on to suggest what people should do while blogging. The irony, much? \n\nMy intention wasn't to do so, though. Instead, I wanted people to not worry about any of that stuff, especially while they are getting started blogging. Over the years, I have written about anything and everything. Hot sarcastic takes. Fiction. Technology. Personal essays. I wrote them all.\n\nMany people suggest that one should stick to a specific area if they want more people to read what they write. It's better if that area is niche. Well, nothing kills a writer's motivation faster than the voice at the back of the mind continuously questioning if they should write what they are writing in the first place. If anyone will read them. That writer will bear that voice a few times but then realize it's too much trouble. And soon stop writing.\n\nSo, long back, I decided I wouldn't judge what I write or where I publish it. Nothing matters as long as I want it to be published. That includes who reads it. Or if anyone does at all. \n\nI have accepted now that the only thing I control is the words. Everything else is external, outside of my control. So why worry about that?\n",

Very few homes in the neighbourhood had them. Even we got it pretty late. I remember when we eventually did, our house became a switchboard, and we were the telephone operators‚Äîconnecting folks all over to ones in our neighbourhood. \n\nWe received calls at home and took the messages. Sometimes, my parents held the line while I, being the only kid in the house, ran to the neighbour's home to invite them to receive the phone call. \n\nIt was all fun, to be frank. It felt good to hear the stories after the phone call. No one left away without sharing what the call was all about. A few wanted to add more context to what we unintentionally heard on one heard by narrating what was said on the other. It all felt customary.\n\nWe never had an answering machine. There was no way to leave a message for us while we were away. So instead, I was the answering machine for others while *they* were away.\n\nAlso, I am not sure I would be comfortable using such machines. I could never convey the message on the spot in short. All I would say is, \"Call me back\". What else can one say without rambling on and on?\n\nSo when I see these machines screw up the main characters' lives in the shows like Seinfeld and Friends, I only chuckle. You know, I have been an answering machine, and we tend to screw up.\n",

It doesn't matter how much one attempts to recover what was lost; the scarred mind cannot be easily healed. \n\nBecause anger scars both people, even the one who gets angry. \n\nHence I have moulded myself to not give in to the instinct when angry. I remind myself that my brain is muddled, and the best action I can take is to walk away and take a few deep breaths. It avoids ruining the remaining day for the other person and me.\n\nDon't recover. Resist.\n",
