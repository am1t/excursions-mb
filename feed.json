So, irrespective of which option you decide to go with, the homepage should feel as part of the original simple and clean theme.\n\nIf you are using the Paper theme, look out for the upgrade option in Plugins. It should be enabled soon. As always, if you find any bug or want any improvements, kindly let me know either as [GitHub issue](https://github.com/am1t/microdotblog-paper/issues/new) or connect with me on [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/amit) / via [email](mailto:reply@amitgawande.com).\n",

				"title": "Porting Hugo theme to Micro.blog",
				"content_html": "<p>Micro.blog is a blogging platform built over Hugo, a fast static site engine. Given the way it is structured, every theme created for Hugo can potentially work with the blog hosted by Micro.blog. However, there are a few aspects added to Hugo that are specific to the way things work in Micro.blog. These need to be included as part of the themes to make the most of the features of this platform.</p>\n<p>This article presents a non-extensive list of things that should be evaluated and included while porting a theme that is made for Hugo to Micro.blog. I have written this as I dug into the existing themes <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/01/23/paper-a-clean.html\">while porting Paper theme</a>. As of this writing, a theme is considered as a plug-in in Micro.blog. Hence, many references link back to the way plug-ins work with the platform.</p>\n<p>To reiterate, this is not an extensive list. Based on how a theme, that is being ported, is set up, one may need only a few of these steps or may need a few more than those listed below. However, this should be a good start to get a working version of the theme out for testing. If there are any issues or concerns, please reply to our email addresses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pre-requisites\">Pre-requisites</h2>\n<p>Of course, the article assumes that you have already identified the theme that you want to port. The <a href=\"https://themes.gohugo.io\">Hugo theme Showcase</a> is a good place to check for all the wonderful themes available.</p>\n<p>Though you are not required to have a detailed understanding of Hugo to port a theme, the knowledge on the below aspects should be handy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-themes/59\">Custom Theme support in Micro.blog</a></li>\n<li>A basic understanding of <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/templates/\">Hugo templates</a> and <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/\">directory structure</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started\">Getting Started</h2>\n<p>The first step to get started is to access and clone the repository of the theme to be ported. You can either do this offline on your desktop or directly create a new theme in Micro.blog with mentioning the theme repository URL as Clone URL. You could then select this newly added theme as a custom theme for your <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2019/09/04/microblog-test-blogs.html\">test blog</a>. This allows you to find out what breaks and also validate the additional modifications that you make to the theme.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>For a theme to work, you only need a few folders and files ‚Äî a typical Micro.blog theme directory structure is provided below for reference.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>.\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ theme.toml\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin.json\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ static\n</code></pre><ul>\n<li><code>theme.toml</code> - Contains bare meta information about the theme, like name, description, license, features, author.</li>\n<li><code>config.json</code> - Contains any properties required and referenced by the template files of the theme. If the property is to be provided by the user, typically it should be taken as a setting, defined in a separate file.</li>\n<li><code>plugin.json</code> - Contains meta information about the custom theme to be displayed as part of plugin repository. It also defines the feature settings that can be provided by user while plugin configuration. Refer to <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/plug-ins/104\">official guide on plug-ins</a> for more details about this file.</li>\n<li><code>layouts</code> - A folder that stores <code>html</code> templates that defines how views of different content types will be rendered on a website with the style.</li>\n<li><code>static</code> - A folder that stores all the static content like CSS, JavaScript, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can get rid of all the other unnecessary files and folders and only keep the above-mentioned ones. This will keep the list of files in which changes are to be made manageable.</p>\n<p>Before we move ahead, here‚Äôs a list of basic template files in the <code>layouts</code> folders that one would modify typically to port a theme.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>/_default/list.html</code> - A template that renders pages with multiple pieces of content, this includes the homepage. A homepage can also be independently styled by defining a template <code>index.html</code> in the root directory.</li>\n<li><code>/_default/single.html</code> or <code>posts/single.html</code> - A template that renders a page for a single post.</li>\n<li><code>/_default/list.archivehtml.html</code> - A template that renders the archive page of your website.</li>\n<li><code>/partials/head.html</code> - A template that defines the <code>head</code> section of your final rendered HTML.</li>\n<li><code>/partials/header.html</code> - A template that defines the header of your blog. This typically includes the site title, subtitle, navigation menu etc.</li>\n<li><code>/partials/footer.html</code> - A template that defines the footer of your blog. This typically includes the copyrights, author information etc.</li>\n<li><code>/_default/baseof.html</code> - A base template that stitches all the above defined partials together, including the main sections defined in list and single template pages above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A theme might have all the above files, or have just a subset of these. In case a theme does not provide a particular template file, one from the basic theme (which forms the base of every theme) of Micro.blog is used.</p>\n<p>Moreover, make sure you configure the appropriate Hugo Version to be used for your blog. Micro.blog allows two versions of Hugo to be used, 0.54 and 0.91, the latest being relatively new. Many themes may not work with the older 0.54 version of the Hugo, typically indicated by the <code>min_version</code> configuration in the <code>theme.toml</code>. If the value is above 0.54, set the Hugo version to be used as 0.91. This can be done via Design ‚Üí Hugo Version.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fix-the-broken-pages\">Fix the Broken Pages</h2>\n<p>Usually, the home page might not render the list of all the posts with the ported templates. This is often due to the wrong selection of the posts. To check the selection, visit the list template mentioned above and fix the file which is fetching all the posts. It should typically look like below where you pull all the regular pages where type is defined as post.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>{{ $pages = where .Site.RegularPages &quot;Type&quot; &quot;post&quot; }}\n</code></pre><p>A similar fix would also need to be applied to the archive page‚Äôs template, if it is defined custom. The archive page would also need styling the components appropriately, as these are all Micro.blog specific classes, not part of the default styling of the theme.</p>\n<p>Next, you will have to fix the templates to handle the title-less posts. Most posts published with Micro.blog are, well, micro-posts with no titles. So, wherever a Title is referenced, it should be wrapped in a <code>&amp;#123;&amp;#123; if .Title }}</code> condition. So, the title reference at every place should read like below.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>{{ if .Title }}\n\t&lt;h2&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/h2&gt;\n{{ end }}\n</code></pre><p>The title-less posts might also need minor styling fixes. A typical pitfall is when a post permalink is only available with title. So, a micro-post requires a different element to carry the permalink, mostly the date-time of the post.</p>\n<p>Another aspect that is typically broken is rendering of the taxonomy. Most of the themes in Hugo use tags to define the taxonomy. Micro.blog uses categories and hence need to fetch them differently. So at every place a template mentions tags, mostly on list template, archives template and single template, replace them with categories. This primarily involves replacing all the references of <code>.Params.tags</code> with <code>.Params.categories</code>.</p>\n<p>With these changes handled, you should have a working website that renders correctly. However, it is still not customised to include the benefits that Micro.blog brings to the table.</p>\n<h2 id=\"add-microblog-specific-tags\">Add Micro.blog Specific Tags</h2>\n<p>Micro.blog packs the key IndieWeb principles, like IndieAuth, MicroPub, Webmentions, out-of-box for all websites hosted with the platform. However, this does involve defining a few relevant aspects at appropriate places. In addition, the platform is also rich in the ways a user not adept with coding can customise their website to their liking, with support for providing custom CSS, footer and plug-ins.

				"content_text": "Micro.blog is a blogging platform built over Hugo, a fast static site engine. Given the way it is structured, every theme created for Hugo can potentially work with the blog hosted by Micro.blog. However, there are a few aspects added to Hugo that are specific to the way things work in Micro.blog. These need to be included as part of the themes to make the most of the features of this platform. \n\nThis article presents a non-extensive list of things that should be evaluated and included while porting a theme that is made for Hugo to Micro.blog. I have written this as I dug into the existing themes [while porting Paper theme](https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/01/23/paper-a-clean.html). As of this writing, a theme is considered as a plug-in in Micro.blog. Hence, many references link back to the way plug-ins work with the platform.\n\nTo reiterate, this is not an extensive list. Based on how a theme, that is being ported, is set up, one may need only a few of these steps or may need a few more than those listed below. However, this should be a good start to get a working version of the theme out for testing. If there are any issues or concerns, please reply to our email addresses.\n\n## Pre-requisites\nOf course, the article assumes that you have already identified the theme that you want to port. The [Hugo theme Showcase](https://themes.gohugo.io) is a good place to check for all the wonderful themes available. \n\nThough you are not required to have a detailed understanding of Hugo to port a theme, the knowledge on the below aspects should be handy.\n\n- [Custom Theme support in Micro.blog](https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-themes/59)\n- A basic understanding of [Hugo templates](https://gohugo.io/templates/) and [directory structure](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe first step to get started is to access and clone the repository of the theme to be ported. You can either do this offline on your desktop or directly create a new theme in Micro.blog with mentioning the theme repository URL as Clone URL. You could then select this newly added theme as a custom theme for your [test blog](https://www.manton.org/2019/09/04/microblog-test-blogs.html). This allows you to find out what breaks and also validate the additional modifications that you make to the theme.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/uploads/2022/7fde8afe70.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"188\" alt=\"\" />\n\nFor a theme to work, you only need a few folders and files ‚Äî a typical Micro.blog theme directory structure is provided below for reference.\n\n```\n.\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ theme.toml\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin.json\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ static\n```\n\n- `theme.toml` - Contains bare meta information about the theme, like name, description, license, features, author. \n- `config.json` - Contains any properties required and referenced by the template files of the theme. If the property is to be provided by the user, typically it should be taken as a setting, defined in a separate file. \n- `plugin.json` - Contains meta information about the custom theme to be displayed as part of plugin repository. It also defines the feature settings that can be provided by user while plugin configuration. Refer to [official guide on plug-ins](https://help.micro.blog/t/plug-ins/104) for more details about this file. \n - `layouts` - A folder that stores `html` templates that defines how views of different content types will be rendered on a website with the style.\n- `static` - A folder that stores all the static content like CSS, JavaScript, etc.\n\nYou can get rid of all the other unnecessary files and folders and only keep the above-mentioned ones. This will keep the list of files in which changes are to be made manageable.\n\nBefore we move ahead, here‚Äôs a list of basic template files in the `layouts` folders that one would modify typically to port a theme.\n\n- `/_default/list.html` - A template that renders pages with multiple pieces of content, this includes the homepage. A homepage can also be independently styled by defining a template `index.html` in the root directory.\n- `/_default/single.html` or `posts/single.html` - A template that renders a page for a single post.\n- `/_default/list.archivehtml.html` - A template that renders the archive page of your website.\n- `/partials/head.html` - A template that defines the `head` section of your final rendered HTML.\n- `/partials/header.html` - A template that defines the header of your blog. This typically includes the site title, subtitle, navigation menu etc.\n- `/partials/footer.html` - A template that defines the footer of your blog. This typically includes the copyrights, author information etc.\n- `/_default/baseof.html` - A base template that stitches all the above defined partials together, including the main sections defined in list and single template pages above.\n\nA theme might have all the above files, or have just a subset of these. In case a theme does not provide a particular template file, one from the basic theme (which forms the base of every theme) of Micro.blog is used. \n\nMoreover, make sure you configure the appropriate Hugo Version to be used for your blog. Micro.blog allows two versions of Hugo to be used, 0.54 and 0.91, the latest being relatively new. Many themes may not work with the older 0.54 version of the Hugo, typically indicated by the `min_version` configuration in the `theme.toml`. If the value is above 0.54, set the Hugo version to be used as 0.91. This can be done via Design ‚Üí Hugo Version.\n\n## Fix the Broken Pages\n\nUsually, the home page might not render the list of all the posts with the ported templates. This is often due to the wrong selection of the posts. To check the selection, visit the list template mentioned above and fix the file which is fetching all the posts. It should typically look like below where you pull all the regular pages where type is defined as post. \n\n```\n{{ $pages = where .Site.RegularPages \"Type\" \"post\" }}\n```\n\nA similar fix would also need to be applied to the archive page‚Äôs template, if it is defined custom. The archive page would also need styling the components appropriately, as these are all Micro.blog specific classes, not part of the default styling of the theme.\n\nNext, you will have to fix the templates to handle the title-less posts. Most posts published with Micro.blog are, well, micro-posts with no titles. So, wherever a Title is referenced, it should be wrapped in a `&#123;&#123; if .Title }}` condition. So, the title reference at every place should read like below.\n\n```\n{{ if .Title }}\n\t<h2>{{ .Title }}</h2>\n{{ end }}\n```\n\nThe title-less posts might also need minor styling fixes. A typical pitfall is when a post permalink is only available with title. So, a micro-post requires a different element to carry the permalink, mostly the date-time of the post. \n\nAnother aspect that is typically broken is rendering of the taxonomy. Most of the themes in Hugo use tags to define the taxonomy. Micro.blog uses categories and hence need to fetch them differently. So at every place a template mentions tags, mostly on list template, archives template and single template, replace them with categories. This primarily involves replacing all the references of `.Params.tags` with `.Params.categories`.\n\nWith these changes handled, you should have a working website that renders correctly. However, it is still not customised to include the benefits that Micro.blog brings to the table.\n\n## Add Micro.blog Specific Tags\n\nMicro.blog packs the key IndieWeb principles, like IndieAuth, MicroPub, Webmentions, out-of-box for all websites hosted with the platform. However, this does involve defining a few relevant aspects at appropriate places. In addition, the platform is also rich in the ways a user not adept with coding can customise their website to their liking, with support for providing custom CSS, footer and plug-ins. Enabling these also need relevant components to be defined.\n\nThe changes to be made are in two files. First, modify the partials template that defines the head section of your website, `/partials/head.html`.\n\n```\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ \"custom.css\" | relURL }}?{{ .Site.Params.theme_seconds }}\">\n<link rel=\"me\" href=\"https://micro.blog/{{ .Site.Author.username }}\" />\n{{ with .Site.Params.twitter_username }}\n\t<link rel=\"me\" href=\"https://twitter.com/{{ . }}\" />\n{{ end }}\n{{ with .Site.Params.github_username }}\n\t<link rel=\"me\" href=\"https://github.com/{{ . }}\" />\n{{ end }}\n{{ with .Site.Params.instagram_username }}\n\t<link rel=\"me\" href=\"https://instagram.com/{{ . }}\" />\n{{ end }}\n\n<link rel=\"authorization_endpoint\" href=\"https://micro.blog/indieauth/auth\" />\n<link rel=\"token_endpoint\" href=\"https://micro.blog/indieauth/token\" />\n<link rel=\"micropub\" href=\"https://micro.blog/micropub\" />\n<link rel=\"microsub\" href=\"https://micro.blog/microsub\" />\n<link rel=\"webmention\" href=\"https://micro.blog/webmention\" />\n<link rel=\"subscribe\" href=\"https://micro.blog/users/follow\" />\n\n{{ range .Site.Params.plugins_css }}\n\t<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ . }}\" />\n{{ end }}\n{{ range $filename := .Site.Params.plugins_html }}\n\t{{ partial $filename $ }}\n{{ end }}\n```\n\nNext, add the below lines to the end of your base template, `/_default/baseof.html` just before `</body>`. These load the custom footer and the plug-ins defined JavaScripts.\n\n```\n{{ partial \"custom_footer.html\" . }}\n\n{{ range .Site.Params.plugins_js }}\n\t<script src=\"{{ . }}\"></script>\n{{ end }}\n```\n\n## Display Replies as Conversations\nMicro.blog allows including replies made on the posts to be shown as conversations on a post page via a design setting (Design ‚Üí Include conversation on post page). However, for the replies to be rendered on your post page, you need to modify your single template, `/_default/single.html` or `posts/single.html`, and add the below lines at the end.\n\n```\n{{ if .Site.Params.include_conversation }}\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://micro.blog/conversation.js?url={{ .Permalink }}\"></script>\n{{ end }}\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nThe difficulty involved in porting a Hugo theme to Micro.blog depends completely on the complexity of the original theme. Though it is difficult to extensively cover all the changes required, fixing the things that are broken and adding support for the Micro.blog specific features and tags is all it takes.

				"content_html": "<p>Respected Mr. Gaitonde,</p>\n<p>I have reached Tikwadi. As I had promised you in our last meeting when you had unnecessarily criticised me for the lack of seriousness, I have taken this job extremely seriously. Let me be extremely clear; your ultimatum that if I do not work sensibly very soon will lead to me losing my job had nothing to do with the deftness with which I have decided to travel.</p>\n<p>Anyway, things are absolutely fine here in Tikwadi. There have been no untoward events until now. I think the villagers had unnecessarily raised an alarm. A day comes. The night follows. And days go by so without anything eventful happening. No murders, no aliens, no ghosts. Not that I am afraid of any of these. For that matter, I do not even believe in such laughable charades.</p>\n<p>Overall, the town is beautiful. The people are also beautiful. Not the women &ndash; I mean, I am not saying the women are not beautiful. I mean, that does not matter to me. Undoubtedly, though, each one is uniquely crazy. Again, not that it matters much to me &ndash; I mean, the job matters to me. But the fact that the town is batshit crazy does not affect me.</p>\n<p>I hope you know what I mean. I will report when something eventful happens. The people are waiting for me for a game of cricket. Football is with me.</p>\n<p>Thank you for the opportunity you gave me. Agent Raghu signing off.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Dear Gaitonde,</p>\n<p>Here I am, reporting to you again from Tikwadi. I will be very crisp this time, as you had said in your letter. I know I wrote numerous unnecessary things in my letter the last time. But my only intention was to let you know how normal the things were. There wasn‚Äôt any other hidden agenda. I won‚Äôt say your quip that ‚Äúyou are not on a picnic there‚Äù did not hurt me. It did ‚Ä¶ I mean just a bit. Not enough to impact my job. You can be assured about that.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, the town does not seem as normal as I had reported the last time. There have been some sightings. Or so the crazy, frightened villagers say. I &ndash; let me assure you again &ndash; am not afraid at all. Just to be absolutely safe, I am just avoiding going to the areas from where the sightings have been reported. It is not because I am afraid. It is just to make sure you continue to get the reports from Tikwadi that you so dearly look out for. If something, anything, happens to me, I do not think it would be straightforward to find an equally qualified agent. I know you told me the last time to not call myself that. But this time it is not the post I am referring to. I use it as a common noun, and it is in that respect I call myself an agent. I am sure the kind heart of yours wouldn‚Äôt mind that.</p>\n<p>Anyway, there is nothing to get very excited or scared about. Sure, the villagers are lunatic. I have no second thought in my mind about that. Furthermore, the town is not at all beautiful; it is miserable rather. The streetlights have no lights in them. The fans leak more noise than the air. Of course, both are true when there is electricity. Can you do something about these power cuts? I know I am an essential part of your team, and you respect me immensely. So, I am sure you would do that much for me. On a positive note, nature is, no doubt, beautiful. And some people are beautiful, beautiful as in not crazy. I only talk to these people regularly. I want to make sure I do not lose my smartness here.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I will keep reporting if there are any more sightings or events. Gauri is calling me. She is beautiful. I mean, not that it matters to me.</p>\n<p>Signing off. Raghu.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Gaitonde,</p>\n<p>I hate you. Why the bloody fuck did you send me to this idiot town. I am no agent. You should have told me that in extremely clear terms. ‚ÄúYou are not an agent, but only our representative‚Äù is not clear enough. I checked the Webster dictionary; one of the synonyms of agents is ‚Äúrepresentative‚Äù, you moron.</p>\n<p>I do not know if it is the town that makes people crazy here, or it is the people who make this town crazy. The dimwits continue to run at me wherever they see me with the reports of the sightings. Some see ghosts. Some see aliens. The idiots tell me the most terrifying tales and leave me alone. They do not even realise I need to live alone after they go.</p>\n<p>There is nothing worth reporting from this windswept town. Have you ever seen a ghost, Gaitonde? I am sure you won‚Äôt know if you have; because they bloody look the same. The Gauri I mentioned in my last letter? They tell me there never was any Gauri in the town. I was naively planning to propose to her very soon; of course, once I complete this job for you. Now I don&rsquo;t even know who is real and who is ghostly. I keep getting slapped as I pull on their moustaches and their hair, just to confirm.</p>\n<p>I am done being your agent. Call me back. If you can‚Äôt get electricity to this town, a request that you so mercilessly thwarted, at least get me a car.</p>\n<p>Raghu</p>\n",

Agent Raghu signing off.\n\n---\n\nDear Gaitonde,\n\nHere I am, reporting to you again from Tikwadi. I will be very crisp this time, as you had said in your letter. I know I wrote numerous unnecessary things in my letter the last time. But my only intention was to let you know how normal the things were. There wasn‚Äôt any other hidden agenda. I won‚Äôt say your quip that ‚Äúyou are not on a picnic there‚Äù did not hurt me. It did ‚Ä¶ I mean just a bit. Not enough to impact my job. You can be assured about that.\n\nIncidentally, the town does not seem as normal as I had reported the last time. There have been some sightings. Or so the crazy, frightened villagers say. I -- let me assure you again -- am not afraid at all. Just to be absolutely safe, I am just avoiding going to the areas from where the sightings have been reported. It is not because I am afraid. It is just to make sure you continue to get the reports from Tikwadi that you so dearly look out for. If something, anything, happens to me, I do not think it would be straightforward to find an equally qualified agent. I know you told me the last time to not call myself that. But this time it is not the post I am referring to. I use it as a common noun, and it is in that respect I call myself an agent. I am sure the kind heart of yours wouldn‚Äôt mind that.\n\nAnyway, there is nothing to get very excited or scared about. Sure, the villagers are lunatic. I have no second thought in my mind about that. Furthermore, the town is not at all beautiful; it is miserable rather. The streetlights have no lights in them. The fans leak more noise than the air. Of course, both are true when there is electricity. Can you do something about these power cuts? I know I am an essential part of your team, and you respect me immensely. So, I am sure you would do that much for me. On a positive note, nature is, no doubt, beautiful. And some people are beautiful, beautiful as in not crazy. I only talk to these people regularly. I want to make sure I do not lose my smartness here.\n\nAnyway, I will keep reporting if there are any more sightings or events. Gauri is calling me. She is beautiful. I mean, not that it matters to me.\n\nSigning off. Raghu.\n\n---\n\nGaitonde,\n\nI hate you. Why the bloody fuck did you send me to this idiot town. I am no agent. You should have told me that in extremely clear terms. ‚ÄúYou are not an agent, but only our representative‚Äù is not clear enough. I checked the Webster dictionary; one of the synonyms of agents is ‚Äúrepresentative‚Äù, you moron.\n\nI do not know if it is the town that makes people crazy here, or it is the people who make this town crazy. The dimwits continue to run at me wherever they see me with the reports of the sightings. Some see ghosts. Some see aliens. The idiots tell me the most terrifying tales and leave me alone. They do not even realise I need to live alone after they go.\n\nThere is nothing worth reporting from this windswept town. Have you ever seen a ghost, Gaitonde? I am sure you won‚Äôt know if you have; because they bloody look the same. The Gauri I mentioned in my last letter? They tell me there never was any Gauri in the town. I was naively planning to propose to her very soon; of course, once I complete this job for you. Now I don't even know who is real and who is ghostly. I keep getting slapped as I pull on their moustaches and their hair, just to confirm.\n\nI am done being your agent. Call me back. If you can‚Äôt get electricity to this town, a request that you so mercilessly thwarted, at least get me a car.\n\nRaghu\n\n",

But until the elements across the body are assigned classes, I will have to stay with this. Anyway, hope this helps. Or if there‚Äôs a better, simpler way to achieve this, I would love to hear.\n\n---\n\n**Update [24 April 2022]**: Fixed the issue with blockquotes being hidden due to the selection for headers being mistakenly applied to the blockquotes too. This uses the recently added CSS selectors for `.microblog_header` and `.microblog_footer`.\n",

Before I realised, I was wishing good night to my phone lying in the bed.\n\nToday, I was on my computer, the powerful personal computer which can cater to all my commands. But I reached out, as if out of habit, to the smartphone just to peek at those apps, the web versions of which I had just visited. I knew I was sick again.\n\nMy smartphone has become the most personal thing I own, but also the one I need to frequently stay away the farthest from. \n\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Hello Friend,</p><p>When I published <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/lets-dwell-in-writing-history/\">the first issue of this newsletter</a>, I had no clue I would do that 20 times over the last fifteen months. I had started writing it with a hope that each issue brings some value to a few writers. Sure, the format did change a couple of times. I decided to make it more personal along the way. But I continued to curate links to some of the most wonderful essays I came across. My intension was to inspire the writer within you.</p><p>That's 60 brilliant essays found and shared since that first issue. I have been happy with the journey till now. Greg Anderson reminds me of why that is important.</p><blockquote>Focus on the journey, not the destination. Joy is found not in finishing an activity but in doing it.</blockquote><p>Yes, I have enjoyed writing every issue. ¬†Sometimes it was the letter I was writing to you that I was excited about. Other times, it was the attachment to an essay I was sharing that mattered to me. Whatever the case, I was excited about every issue that I sent to you.</p><p>But that hasn't been the case recently. Sure, I continue to enjoy writing on my blog ‚Äì as I had said in <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/10/08/why-do-i.html\">one of the recent posts</a>, \"writing something, anything, makes me focused. It calms me down.\" So, it's not the process of writing that I have stopped enjoying. It is the format that, I have realized, I can't give justice to any more.</p><p>\"If you don't want to do it now, you don't want to do it at all. Let it go,\" suggests Derek Sivers in his <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/10/23/i-dont-remember.html\">brilliant</a> new book \"How to Live\".</p><p>So, here I am letting this go. This is the last issue for the newsletter Slanting Nib & A Keyboard. I hope you enjoyed reading the issues as much as I did writing them.</p><p>What does it mean for the subscribers? Well, first off, I will stop sending you any more letters to you, even if you continue to stay signed up. I prefer not to break your trust. You had signed up for something which I no longer intend to deliver.</p><p>With that said, this place <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/\">Slanting Nib</a> will continue to stay active. As I said earlier, I still <em>love </em>writing. I will post a few stories that are closest to my heart. </p><p>So, if you wish to receive these stories from me via mails, please drop me a note. Just hit reply, or <a href=\"mailto:me@amitgawande.com\">email me.</a> I would be glad to send you my personal stories, with a promise of not doing so more than once a week.</p><p>Thank you for subscribing and <em>reading </em>my newsletter. Goodbye for now!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://static.amitgawande.com/images/2021/leon-seibert-_LZZnHexYKM-unsplash.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1445\"><figcaption>Artwork by Leon Seibert on Unsplash</figcaption></figure><p>-<em>Amit</em></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I recently <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/10/12/of-course-i.html\">started blogging with Drummer</a>, a new Outliner made public by Dave Winer. It has been a wonderful experience. I don‚Äôt know what it is about a single outline as a base for your blog, but it feels natural. I have been enjoying writing and playing around with <a href=\"https://ol.amitgawande.com\">my Drummer blog</a>. However, it is not easy to fathom the simplicity of the whole system just through words ‚Äî only trying it out will make you appreciate the ease. I wanted to capture what it is and how to quickly get started with it for myself and others to follow.</p>\n<p>Drummer documentation captures most of this information. But for someone, like me, who‚Äôs new to the concept of outliner, the whole stuff can be pretty overwhelming. So, here I capture what I learned and liked so that it helps other newbies like me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-an-outliner\">What‚Äôs an Outliner?</h2>\n<p>An outliner is basically an editor that can edit an outline. What is an outline, you ask? Well, outline is text items represented in a hierarchy, with each item having a parent (typically a title) or multiple sub-items (typically related points). There‚Äôs a lot more to know, but I am more focused on drawing a parallel with regular blogging terminologies.</p>\n<p>You can think of a first parent item as a title of your post. Each sub-item that follows is like a new paragraph. You can further divide the items into sub-items, that‚Äôs grouping related points into a subtitle for example. The only difference is instead of it being represented as a header and list of paragraphs, it is a tree-structure of points, closely related and unrelated.</p>\n<p>If a post doesn‚Äôt have any child, it‚Äôs a titleless post, a micro-post ‚Äî something like a tweet.</p>\n<p>Dave Winer is the strongest proponent of using the outlines as the base for the blogs, he uses them for his blog, <a href=\"http://scripting.com\">Scripting News</a>. The basic hierarchical structure of an outline, makes using outliner for blogging powerful. Both the types of posts, long-form and micro, sit well together. After all, it‚Äôs just one long list of text items one after another. Whether they have a sub-item or not define how they get represented. Or that‚Äôs how Dave likes them represented.</p>\n<p>Drummer is one such outliner that benefits from the years of Dave‚Äôs experience. He has understood all the nitty-gritty of blogging through this form. So, once you overcome the initial struggle of unknown, the experience is pretty smooth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"is-it-a-blogging-cms\">Is it a Blogging CMS?</h2>\n<p>Not really, Drummer is just a web application that can edit outlines. These outlines are typically represented as an <code>OPML</code> file. Basically, all you do with Drummer is edit <code>OPML</code> files of different forms. It wraps a few special <code>OPML</code> files ‚Äî mainly <code>blog.opml</code> ‚Äî to give them specific meaning while using them as base for blogging.</p>\n<p>But, all we do is edit these <code>OPML</code> files then, what builds the blog?</p>\n<p>Well, the software that runs Dave‚Äôs blog does that job. It is called <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog\">Old School</a> (because Dave believes this is the old school way of blogging) and is hosted by Dave. In a way, Old School is the blogging CMS and not Drummer.</p>\n<p>So, from my understanding, the way the thing connect is as below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You sign in with your Twitter account and that creates the necessary backend ‚Äî basically a S3 store for your OPML files ‚Äî based on your Twitter username.</li>\n<li>You create, view, edit the <code>OPML</code> files using Drummer. The special files like <code>blog.opml</code> and <code>about.opml</code> hold special meaning for Old School. (<strong>Update:</strong> In fact, <code>about.opml</code> is just used for representation. You can name it anything.) So, you update them and through a command in Drummer (Build my blog), you communicate to Old School server to refresh your blog.</li>\n<li>Old School receives the communication and based on provided inputs, it identifies the files to use for building the blog. It reads the <code>OPML</code> files from the backend store for the files and converts them to static files that get served as your blog.</li>\n<li>Old School also serves you blog at the <code>http://oldschool.scripting.com/&lt;your-user-name&gt;</code> URL. So in a way, you don‚Äôt need to host any additional software.</li>\n</ol>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-get-started\">How do I get started?</h2>\n<p>Dave has a got a handy documentation in place that you can follow. I will point to the relevant parts in the documentation so that you can follow along and get started.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Main blog:</strong> Follow the <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628692121000\">getting started guide</a> to get a blog up and running with Drummer. In short, create a <code>blog.opml</code> outline file. Make the outline public. And finally, build the blog using <code>Tools &gt; Build my blog...</code>. This should open a new tab with your blog rendered with Old School. You can customise your title and description of your blog and a few head-level attributes.</li>\n<li><strong>Title and Description:</strong> Modify/add the head-level attributes <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> and rebuild your blog.</li>\n<li><strong>Header Image:</strong> Add a head-level attribute <code>urlHeaderImage</code> pointing to the header image of your choice and rebuild your blog.</li>\n<li><strong>Copyright:</strong> Add a head-level attribute <code>copyright</code> with the text you want to appear in the footer and rebuild your blog.</li>\n<li><strong>About Page:</strong> If you want to create a new tab in your blog for <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1633177951000\">your About page</a>, create a new <code>about.opml</code> outline file using Drummer, make the outline public, add a head-level attribute <code>urlAboutOpml</code> pointing to this public outline and build your blog again. (<strong>Update:</strong> In fact, <code>about.opml</code> is just used for representation. You can name it anything, as long as you configure the value for <code>urlAboutOpml</code> accordingly.)</li>\n<li><strong>Link Blog:</strong> If the concept of linkblog excites you, you <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1633177803000\">can use another software</a> by Dave, <a href=\"http://radio3.io/\">Radio3</a>. Just add a new head-level attribute <code>urlLinkblogJson</code> pointing to your linkblog JSON file, which would look something like <code>http://radio3.io/users/&lt;your-user-name&gt;/linkblog.json</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>TimeZone:</strong> To make sure the dates are rendered correctly on your blog, add a head-level attribute <code>timeZoneOffset</code> for the place where you would be blogging from. The value should be the offset from UTC ‚Äî for example, <code>+5:30</code> for India or <code>-4</code> for New York.</li>\n<li><strong>Creating Post:</strong> Head over to your <code>blog.opml</code> file in Drummer and click on the <strong>+</strong> icon (for New Note), write what you want to write and rebuild your blog. Your post should be up.</li>\n<li><strong>Adding Links:</strong> Select the text to which you want to add a link, click on the ‚ÄúLink‚Äù icon (the second icon from top in the icon bar that sits on the left of the editing area) and insert the URL.</li>\n<li><strong>Adding Images:</strong> This one‚Äôs slightly tricky. First, have your image hosted on some place where it would be accessible publicly. Get the URL to your image. While on the item you want to associate the image with, click on the ‚ÄúEdit attributes‚Äù icon (the third icon from top in the icon bar that sits on the left of the editing area). Now you can either create an inline image (with attribute <code>inlineImage</code>), right-margin image (with attribute <code>image</code>), title image (with attribute <code>metaImage</code>). I wish this work was simpler.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At this point, you should have a well-configured blog up and running. Keep Drummer interface open in tab and keep adding entries. This method of updating your blog will soon grow on you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-else-can-i-customise\">What else can I customise?</h2>\n<p>Even though you have all the basics covered till now, there is still a lot that you can and should do.

Drummer is your editor where you write your posts. Old School acts as a CMS to build and serve your blog.</p>\n\n## How do I get started?\nDave has a got a handy documentation in place that you can follow. I will point to the relevant parts in the documentation so that you can follow along and get started.\n\n1. **Main blog:** Follow the [getting started guide](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628692121000) to get a blog up and running with Drummer. In short, create a `blog.opml` outline file. Make the outline public. And finally, build the blog using `Tools > Build my blog...`. This should open a new tab with your blog rendered with Old School.

(**Update:** In fact, `about.opml` is just used for representation. You can name it anything, as long as you configure the value for `urlAboutOpml` accordingly.)\n6. **Link Blog:** If the concept of linkblog excites you, you [can use another software](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1633177803000) by Dave, [Radio3](http://radio3.io/). Just add a new head-level attribute `urlLinkblogJson` pointing to your linkblog JSON file, which would look something like `http://radio3.io/users/<your-user-name>/linkblog.json`. \n7. **TimeZone:** To make sure the dates are rendered correctly on your blog, add a head-level attribute `timeZoneOffset` for the place where you would be blogging from. The value should be the offset from UTC ‚Äî for example, `+5:30` for India or `-4` for New York.\n8. **Creating Post:** Head over to your `blog.opml` file in Drummer and click on the **+** icon (for New Note), write what you want to write and rebuild your blog. Your post should be up.\n9. **Adding Links:** Select the text to which you want to add a link, click on the ‚ÄúLink‚Äù icon (the second icon from top in the icon bar that sits on the left of the editing area) and insert the URL.\n10. **Adding Images:** This one‚Äôs slightly tricky.

There‚Äôs a Mac app (electron based) called [Electric Drummer](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml) that can act as an outliner. However, you should avoid using it for blogging if you intend to blog from multiple systems. Changes made through the app can overwrite ones as done on the web Drummer. So thread carefully.\n2. Drummer is evolving. Dave is working hard to make sure all serious reported issues are resolved. Early adopters are trying out a hundred things independently. If that sounds fun, the [Drummer support issues page](https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues) is the place to go. \n3. You can stay-to-date with all things Drummer by following [this official blog](http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/). \n4. How does Drummer cost zero? [Dave answers](http://scripting.com/2021/10/12.html#a114128).\n5. Why is Drummer, and other software from Dave, so tightly coupled with Twitter? [Dave answers](http://scripting.com/2021/10/13/140500.html?title=whyWeUseTwitterIdentity).\n\n‚Äî\n\nI intend to use Drummer as a place where I form my thoughts over the time.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Hello Friend,</p><p>After reading my fair share of self-help books recently, I have realized that they all follow a pattern. They start with a brilliant, unique idea. The first few chapters present the core in the most masterly manner and back it up with intriguing research and anecdotes. The author wants to answer one key question, why all readers <em>should</em> listen to what she says.</p><p>This part of the self-help books, especially those around psychology, gets a firm grasp on my interest. I usually note what amuses me about the central premise and the structure that the writer has put forth thoroughly. And then the book hits a damper.</p><p>Though the initial chapters always pique my interest, the subsequent chapters are most tiring to read through. They are generally fillers, present just to elevate the central idea into a book.</p><p>This hack of chasing fillers taints most of the self-help books published today. To avoid that, the author needs to be an absolute master at what she is talking about. She needs to know a lot more than she is willing to include in the book, a rarity among authors of self-help books. They generally start as a blog post, evolve and expand after numerous interactions with friends and readers.</p><p>Another case when an author doesn‚Äôt chase the fillers is when she doesn't hesitate to give up on the conventional measures of completion and success. The author does not consider the number of pages or the quote-worthy phrases as her target ‚Äì a case in point, most self-published authors.</p><p>The first is about confidence in one's prowess. The second one is about control on one's objective. Self-confidence and self-control allow a writer to eliminate the need to artificially puff up their work with unnecessary fillers. And this has an apt parallel in our real life too. If we have control over deciding what matters, discipline to pursue it and confidence to execute it, we need not surround our lives with fillers.</p><p>Avoid fillers in what you say or do. Be clear about your core and focus only on that. What do you believe in? Everything else that you undertake or achieve is just a filler ‚Äî all it does is deviate you from what you should focus your time and energy on. What do you believe in? Everything else wastes the time of yours and others, just like a book full of fillers does for its writers and its readers.</p><p>The filler pages do not define a book, the same way the filler days do not define who we are. Our core defines us. So, ask yourself again ‚Äî what is your core?</p><hr><h3 id=\"the-radical-moral-implications-of-luck-in-human-life-by-david-roberts-%E2%86%92\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/8/21/17687402/kylie-jenner-luck-human-life-moral-privilege\">\"<strong>The Radical </strong>Moral <strong>Implications of Luck in </strong>Human <strong>Life</strong>\"<strong> by David Roberts</strong></a> ‚Üí</strong></h3><blockquote>Allowing for luck can dent our self-conception. It can diminish our sense of control. It opens up all kinds of uncomfortable questions about obligations to other, less fortunate people. Nonetheless, this is a battle that cannot be bypassed. There can be no ceasefire. Individually, coming to terms with luck is the secular equivalent of religious awakening, the first step in building any coherent universalist moral perspective. Socially, acknowledging the role of luck lays a moral foundation for humane economic, housing, and carceral policy.</blockquote><h3 id=\"why-modern-life-feels-rather-undead-by-chuck-klosterman-%E2%86%92\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/arts/television/05zombies.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all\">\"<strong>Why Modern Life Feels Rather Undead</strong>\"<strong> by Chuck Klosterman</strong></a> </strong>‚Üí</h3><blockquote>Every zombie war is a war of attrition. It‚Äôs always a numbers game. And it‚Äôs more repetitive than complex. In other words, zombie killing is philosophically similar to reading and deleting 400 work e-mails on a Monday morning or filling out paperwork that only generates more paperwork, or following Twitter gossip out of obligation, or performing tedious tasks in which the only true risk is being consumed by the avalanche. The principal downside to any zombie attack is that the zombies will never stop coming; the principal downside to life is that you will be never be finished with whatever it is you do.</blockquote><h3 id=\"the-creative-apocalypse-that-wasn%E2%80%99t-by-steven-johnson-%E2%86%92\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/magazine/the-creative-apocalypse-that-wasnt.html\">\" The Creative Apocalypse That Wasn‚Äôt\" by Steven Johnson</a> </strong>‚Üí</h3><blockquote>It has never been easier to <em><em>start</em></em> making money from creative work, for your passion to undertake that critical leap from pure hobby to part-time income source. Write a novel or record an album, and you can get it online and available for purchase right away, without persuading an editor or an A&R executive that your work is commercially viable. From the consumer‚Äôs perspective, blurring the boundaries has an obvious benefit: It widens the pool of potential talent. But it also has an important social merit. Widening the pool means that more people are earning income by doing what they love.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>I also write long-form essays by choice, which I publish along with the issues of this newsletter.

				"content_text": "<p>Over the years, I have realized that my mind is a pool of copious ideas from varied fields. It is like an open pond, extremely prone to ripples from externalities, big and small. There was a time when I picked every idea up and started working on it. I would spend weeks on these side projects. Soon, there would be a new one vying for my attention and I would hop onto the new hustle.</p><p>I have begun and shuttered so many of such side projects that I have lost count of them now. Some new platforms that solved no new problem for me. An open-source utility which I understood nothing of, except for the fact that its source was open. A self-hosted service that I had no use for. And the list goes on and on. </p><p>My fascination towards such unending projects affected me in many ways. The most troubling of them was that I had no time to pause and listen to my thoughts. I lent myself no time to <em>not</em> be busy, to slack. Here's Shane Parrish <a href=\"https://fs.blog/2021/05/slack/\">reiterating the importance of slack</a> to be productive in our lives (as defined by Tom DeMarco in his book <em><em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123715.Slack\">Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency</a></em></em>). </p><blockquote>Many of us have come to expect work to involve no slack time because of the negative way we perceive it. In a world of manic efficiency, slack often comes across as laziness or a lack of initiative. Without slack time, however, we know we won‚Äôt be able to get through new tasks straight away, and if someone insists we should, we have to drop whatever we were previously doing.</blockquote><p>That is precisely the state I found myself in. I was too welcoming, with my arms spread, ready to embrace anything and everything that got recommended to me. Even a mention of such a topic, and I was all ears.</p><p>I no longer do that. Anytime I am faced with such a ripple now, I take a deep breath, blink and calmly say, \"no, I do not have time for you. You, even though curious, are not my priority.\"</p><p>Priority is an important word that governs how we lead our life. I recently learnt that when the term \"priority\" was coined (somewhere in the 1300s), it was singular. It stayed that way for ages. Decades. Centuries. It was only in the 20th century that we, new age humans, muddled the meaning of the term.</p><p>By definition, \"priority\" means \"the quality of being prior\". <em>The prior one</em>. Basically, the stuff of priority is one thing that should get all your attention. </p><p>Then we changed the meaning of <em>being efficient</em>. Doing things as a group, per the plan, within time mattered no more. Each individual had to be manifolds more productive, pick up more things to do in parallel. And in our quest to do more in parallel at all costs, we introduced the plural form of the term \"priority\". We started thinking about those 2 or 4 or 10 things that we could divide our attention among. We assigned numbers to them. \"<em>This is priority 1. This is a P2 item.\" </em></p><p>Think about it - the usage of the words \"topmost priority\" itself is so redundant. If you call something a priority, it should get your special attention. It should be the thing of <em>the highest importance</em>.</p><p>I have realized the hard way that more often than not, doing less is doing more. When I am not doing many things at the same time, my attention is not spread too thin. Being busy and being productive are two different things. <a href=\"https://perell.com/note/open-mode-and-closed-mode/\">David Perell puts it nicely</a>, contrasting these two distinctive states of mind.</p><blockquote>Our best ideas rarely come alive in busyness. They spring to life in calm and aimless contemplation. In beer mode, you find inspiration. And in coffee mode, you harvest that inspiration.</blockquote><p>The choice of words \"calms and aimless contemplation\" is so brilliant. That's what saying \"no\" to most instinctive side hustles, not always staying busy, allows me time for. I calmly sit idle for hours at times, contemplating on stuff that I read, hear and see. I take notes, jot down thoughts to elaborate on later.</p><p>Here's Parrish again, reminding us of the drawbacks of being constantly busy.</p><blockquote>Being comfortable with sometimes being 0 percent busy means we think about whether we‚Äôre doing the right thing. This is in contrast to grabbing the first task we see so no one thinks we‚Äôre lazy. The expectation of ‚Äúconstant busyness means efficiency‚Äù creates pressure to always look occupied and keep a buffer of work on hand.</blockquote><p>Amen. Could I, then, do more if I didn't hold myself back and said \"yes\" to more things? Maybe. But then, more is not always better.</p><hr><p>Cover Artwork by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@kencheungphoto?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Ken Cheung</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></p>\n",

I don‚Äôt blame them ‚Äî but it hurts me. I interact with only a handful of people that own an Apple device.\n\nGoogle, well, decides to live in a fantasy world where there can exist no perfect messaging app. They get close to finding that right solution and throw it all away.\n\nI had hopes from Microsoft. But for some reason they seem not to be interested in consumer space. Skype is ugly, its too bloated and the experience is terrible. It is not easy for families to join from.\n\nWhatsApp, amidst all the mess, remains the only solution that does the required to any extend. It‚Äôs a terrible experience, but at least it works. \n\n",

				"title": "On Making Space for More",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Hello Friend,</p><p>Over the last weekend, my wife and I decided to clean all the closets and drawers. Pretty soon, we extended the sphere to cover every nook and corner of our house. The idea was to go through each section of our home, find all the junk lying around unused, and get rid of it if it does not justify the space it occupies. In a way, I was working under the guidance of my wife - <em>the most</em> organized person in my eye. She is very particular about organizing stuff, and here is the process we had followed.</p><p>We selected a closet, took down all the contents, and then worked on them. We segregated them on multiple parameters ‚Äì when was this last used, is that usage still applicable, is this here just for emotional value and so on. Then, we tagged and ordered them. Finally, we grouped them into containers whose sizes varied from small boxes to huge travel sacks.</p><p>As the sun was on its descent in the sky, we worked on an under-bed drawer. It was a massive unit - enough for a person to sleep comfortably, albeit breathlessly - but it had no compartments. So, naturally, the stuff was just spewed all around, making the whole drawer appear super untidy. Not that any of the items in there were soiled. Many were even untouched, unused. What the drawer was lacking was an arrangement of some kind. So, we got down to work. We grouped and stored the stuff into the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JP5Z88N/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_dl_8SQ0750T8GGEDAJCBDTA\">large storage bag-cum-organizers</a> that we had recently ordered just for this purpose. The difference that simple activity caused was immense. The drawer still contained the same things, but it didn't resemble the mess earlier.</p><p>As the night dawned, we breathed a satisfying sigh, proud of what we had achieved. The cabinets looked clean, and we made space in the whole home. I felt even the home must have breathed a huge sigh of relief - after all, we had relieved it of some burden.</p><p>The slight effort that we had put in to evaluate, dump, segregate and reorganize stuff in our home had made our abode look cleaner, spacious. </p><p>And you know what I realized? I do apply the same process we used to organize our home to my mind too. A slight effort I put in occasionally to evaluate, dump, segregate and reorganize my thoughts leads to a calmer and receptive mind. I dump the thoughts onto the pages of my diary, not trying to organize them in the process. I meditate as I evaluate the thoughts hovering around. Sure, sorting and reorganizing thoughts is not as easy as moving stuff to the storage bags. But to me, a form of bullet journaling helps organize the ideas.</p><p>This process of journaling and meditation is an act of housecleaning for my mind. It declutters it, makes it a lot less messy when I look inwards. At the same time, it frees it up to welcome more ideas. Just as it did recently to our home.</p><p>Anyway, here is the selection of three brilliant essays on life for this week.</p><hr><h3 id=\"we-are-all-confident-idiots-by-david-dunning-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://www.psmag.com/navigation/health-and-behavior/confident-idiots-92793/\">\"We Are All Confident Idiots\" by David Dunning</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>Because it‚Äôs so easy to judge the idiocy of others, it may be sorely tempting to think this doesn‚Äôt apply to you. But the problem of unrecognized ignorance is one that visits us all. And over the years, I‚Äôve become convinced of one key, overarching fact about the ignorant mind. One should not think of it as uninformed. Rather, one should think of it as misinformed.<br><br>An ignorant mind is precisely not a spotless, empty vessel, but one that‚Äôs filled with the clutter of irrelevant or misleading life experiences, theories, facts, intuitions, strategies, algorithms, heuristics, metaphors, and hunches that regrettably have the look and feel of useful and accurate knowledge.</blockquote><h3 id=\"my-failed-attempts-to-hoard-anything-at-all-by-david-sedaris-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/my-failed-attempts-to-hoard-anything-at-all\">\"My Failed Attempts to Hoard Anything at All\" by David Sedaris</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>It helps to look at which shelves are bare. That teaches you, I suppose, what you should be hoarding. Most of the people I see in lines these days aren‚Äôt real cooks. I noticed at my neighborhood stores that all the canned spaghetti sauces were gone, the horrible ones that taste like ketchup, as well as the frozen pizzas and burritos‚Äîstuff we never eat. Toilet paper is gone, too, of course, as are paper towels.</blockquote><h3 id=\"english-is-not-normal-by-john-mcwhorter-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-english-so-weirdly-different-from-other-languages\">\"English Is Not Normal\" by John McWhorter</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>To be fair, mongrel vocabularies are hardly uncommon worldwide, but English‚Äôs hybridity is high on the scale compared with most European languages. The previous sentence, for example, is a riot of words from Old English, Old Norse, French and Latin. Greek is another element: in an alternate universe, we would call photographs ‚Äòlightwriting‚Äô. According to a fashion that reached its zenith in the 19th century, scientific things had to be given Greek names. Hence our undecipherable words for chemicals: why can‚Äôt we call monosodium glutamate ‚Äòone-salt gluten acid‚Äô? It‚Äôs too late to ask. But this muttly vocabulary is one of the things that puts such a distance between English and its nearest linguistic neighbours.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>I have recently started writing more long-form essays by choice, which I publish along with the issues of this newsletter.

				"content_text": "<p>I started writing actively on the web some 15 years back. As I look back today to these years gone by, I realize I have discovered a few ironies of life, a few lessons for the writer within me. Today, I want to evaluate where I am and share what I have learned over these years. But let me start with a fascinating Aesop‚Äôs fable, though ‚Äî a tale about a man, his son and their hard-working donkey.</p><p>A man and his son were once walking to the market with their donkey along by their side. Neither of them was sitting on the donkey. A fellow countryman suggested, ‚ÄúWhy don't you ride on the donkey? After all, what is it for but to ride upon, you fool?‚Äù</p><p>When the man put only the boy on the donkey, another person complained, ‚ÄúLook at that lazy youngster who lets his father walk. Yet, he rides.‚Äù Tired, when he got on himself, a woman scoffed, ‚ÄúShame on that lazy person. He lets his poor little son plod along. Yet, he rides.‚Äù</p><p>Well, the man took his boy up before him on the donkey, and the passers-by started jeering and pointing at them. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey of yours,‚Äù they said.</p><p>The man and boy, at last, lifted the donkey over their heads and carried him on their shoulders. They went along as all who they met laughed at them. The donkey, though, knew just one way to live ‚Äî to do his thing. So, he was still flapping his legs in the air.</p><p>In short, everyone had laughed at the man and the son, whatever they did. It's an interesting tale of how criticism, if paid any heed to, would just make things worse for you. However, here's how I look at the story. </p><p>Do you know who was unaffected as the town was laughing along? Yep, the donkey. Do you know who didn't get any criticism from anyone? Yep, the donkey.</p><p>As I began writing more on the web and making it public, I realized very early on that I cannot let the criticism or the scoff that I will invariably receive from the ugly Internet affect me. I wrote on my blog. I wrote on Medium. Not only that, I shared my writings at many places, not being worried about what others will say. That was so unlike me, the introvert. But if I hadn't done so, I may have stopped writing a long time back.</p><p><em>Try to please everyone, and you will please no one,</em> the saying goes. So, be a donkey, stay unaffected by the criticism and continue your creative work.</p><hr><p>Through these 15 years, my productivity for writing has not been consistent, though. I have been super productive at times, publishing multiple posts in a week, and then there have been times when I did not post for months. I have blamed it on platforms, the editors, my lifestyle, my likings etc. But I have come to realize it is cyclic for me, these are all phases. I do want to compare two specific phases that I have enjoyed a lot. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586875103900-8291ee09d6fd?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHBoYXNlcyUyMG9mJTIwbGlmZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjkyOTMyMDc&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"5184\" height=\"3888\" srcset=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586875103900-8291ee09d6fd?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHBoYXNlcyUyMG9mJTIwbGlmZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjkyOTMyMDc&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586875103900-8291ee09d6fd?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHBoYXNlcyUyMG9mJTIwbGlmZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjkyOTMyMDc&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586875103900-8291ee09d6fd?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHBoYXNlcyUyMG9mJTIwbGlmZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjkyOTMyMDc&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586875103900-8291ee09d6fd?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHBoYXNlcyUyMG9mJTIwbGlmZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjkyOTMyMDc&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@molnj?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Jocelyn Morales</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>There was a time when was I was <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/categories/fiction/\">writing fiction</a> pretty regularly. I made it a habit, a routine to write short stories and send them to publications on Medium. I was productive, and I had fun. But for some unknown reason, I had stopped reading. I now feel I had even stopped living, unaware of events that I was surrounded by.</p><p>That did not help. And I was reminded of another phase when I wasn't churning fiction from my mind. I just narrated things happening around me, and yet I was most creative and productive then.</p><p>I wrote posts about <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/2010/02/04/230700.html\">crappy elevator logic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/2010/05/15/191300.html\">stupid bets</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/2014/08/13/105900.html\">my conscious subconscious</a> or the time when I <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/2009/09/27/202300.html\">didn't claim my spectacles</a> because I preferred not to hurt my ego. Were these posts great? Who cares? I felt good. I could never weave a better story than what life was weaving around me.</p><p>Keep your eyes open. Some of the most amazing stories surround us. Stay inspired ‚Äî because <em>life creates better stories than a writer's pen</em>. You just have to pay attention.</p><p>And don't ever halt for planning what you want to write. During each of these phases of my writing, I thought I knew where I wanted to take my writing to. A life journal. Fiction. Humour.</p><p>It was as if I was deciding for myself what I was <em>allowed to</em> write, what I would enjoy writing for the longest, or what I would be good at. That was senseless ‚Äî I now know that would have never worked. But as Chris Crutchly said, <em>hindsight's never around when you need it</em>.</p><p>There is no point planning too much, too ahead. Just create. Do what your heart says now, without thinking where it will lead you. Don't try to connect the dots while you are planting them ‚Äî <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc\">a genius once said</a> you can only do that looking backwards.</p><hr><p>Nonetheless, there are times when I do halt. After all, life does suck every so often. It has been doing that for the past 18 months. I was taken over by boredom, and yet didn't know what I could do with all the time I had at my hands. I was living through phases that weren't comfortable. And I followed the easiest path, I stopped writing. I have done such foolhardy multiple times in these last 15 years.</p><blockquote>Under heaven, all can see beauty as beauty, ‚Å£<br>only because there is ugliness.</blockquote><p>Lao Tzu, the famous Chinese philosopher, says while talking about the duality of life. It is so true. It's easy to forget that things will eventually improve. We begin to label things. Negative and positive. Right and wrong. Sad and happy. But, as the masters at Pixar once said, ‚Äú<em>Sometimes the only way to really appreciate joy is to experience sadness</em>‚Äù. </p><p>Lao ends his verse with these lines.</p><blockquote>\"When the work is done, it is forgotten.<br>That is why it lasts forever.\"</blockquote><p>Yep, don't halt. Create. Write. Get bored. Be surrounded by negative thoughts. Get bogged down by them. But don't stop writing. ¬†Don't publish them, sure. Let them lie forgotten in the pages of your diary. But write.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490730141103-6cac27aaab94?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGluc3BpcmF0aW9ufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyOTI5MzQxMQ&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Without wings I can feel free\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"5184\" height=\"3456\" srcset=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490730141103-6cac27aaab94?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGluc3BpcmF0aW9ufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyOTI5MzQxMQ&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490730141103-6cac27aaab94?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGluc3BpcmF0aW9ufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyOTI5MzQxMQ&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490730141103-6cac27aaab94?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGluc3BpcmF0aW9ufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyOTI5MzQxMQ&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490730141103-6cac27aaab94?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGluc3BpcmF0aW9ufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyOTI5MzQxMQ&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@coopery?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Mohamed Nohassi</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>And definitely don't wait for the inspiration to come to you from outside. I have realized it's the worst way to get inspired to write. I read. I listen. I see. And that's when I write. I can't depend on others for inspiration. I need to seek it out. </p><p>Things tend to happen to you in life when you are not ready. So, I am always ready. I am always writing. What's written is not perfect every time. But when that one perfect thought does hit me, I am usually ready. And boy, I have written my fair share of imperfect posts. Stupid posts. When I read a few of these posts from the early days, I cringe. </p><p>I was told the tone of my posts is not right. Or the platform I am writing at is not right. Or my method of sharing is not right. But I didn't care. I was stubborn in what I wanted to write. It was OK if it came out stupid.</p><p>But you know what, at times I wish I could still be that same free self. The stupid one. I had the most fun then. I am a shadow of that person ‚Äî but I have learned the lesson. It's OK to be stupid. Just be alive. I write what my mind wants me to write <em>now</em>. At this moment. I write what I want to read. It doesn't matter how cringe-worthy it sounds.</p><p>Be stupid. But then be playful. Be eager to learn.<br>Be stubborn. But then be cautious. Be friendly.</p><p>Do you know what other animal shares all these characteristics as per Wikipedia? A donkey. So be a donkey. But act. Write. Create.</p><hr><p>I had delivered a talk with this content as part of <a href=\"https://micro.camp/\">Micro Camp 2021</a>.</p><p>Cover Artwork by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@cristina_gottardi?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Cristina Gottardi</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/creative?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></p>\n",

The expectations gap has an outsized impact on my experience. How do I get better at discovering realistic expectations without shortchanging myself?</blockquote><p>Even I got curious. What are realistic expectations? Cheri Baker <a href=\"https://micro.blog/Cheri/11788277\">pointed him</a> to <a href=\"https://modernstoicism.com/what-many-people-misunderstand-about-the-stoic-dichotomy-of-control-by-michael-tremblay/\">an article by Gregory Sadler</a> discussing the Stoic concept of the dichotomy of control. </p><p>It is an insightful read ‚Äî what was most enlightening for me was reading about the concepts of control and power. Here is the relevant passage from Epictetus's Handbook (emphasis mine) that Gregory examines and talks about.</p><blockquote>Some things are within our power (<em>eph‚Äô ƒìmin</em> in the original Greek) while others are not. Within our power are opinion, motivation, desire, aversion, and, in a word, <strong>whatever is of our own doing</strong>; not within our power are our body, our property, reputation, office, and, in a word, whatever is not of our own doing.</blockquote><p>I always knew that I should not let things outside my control affect me and my day-to-day life. And I always struggled with that ‚Äî how can you stay aloof to what is happening around you? Why can't you control your behaviour? I realized after reading the essay, though, that there is a minor distinction between control and power.</p><p>Control is too strong a word. There are times when I (and possibly each one of us) get frustrated and quip that I control nothing. In short, I am neither able to decide nor influence the things happening around me.</p><p>It typically happens when I decide to wake up one fine day, get ready and spend the whole day with myself, reading and writing. But the morning jerks me up amidst complete chaos ‚Äî things are broken around me, physically and mentally. The tap has suddenly started leaking. Or my kid or spouse do not share my enthusiasm for a beautiful day. Sure, I might still have a wonderful day. But stay saddened by the fact that the day turned out to be so different from what I had fancied.</p><p>So, what does one do? To think that nothing is in our control and not set any expectations is effortless, yet wrong. Furthermore, setting realistic expectations is a lot harder than it sounds. Whatever expectations you set for yourself, there is a slight probability that fate has other plans for you. </p><p>Gregory suggests that I should mould my thought process. Rather than thinking that I would not let things outside my control affect me, I should reason with myself on these lines.</p><blockquote>I am responsible for, and should focus upon, the things that depend upon me, i.e. my beliefs, my decisions, and my character. These are the things that matter, which determine if I am a good or bad person, and If I live a happy or unhappy life. I not mistakenly think my happiness or value is determined by the things not ‚Äòup to‚Äô me.</blockquote><p>Here is my takeaway. The only thing I should focus on is the thing that is up to me, my character. Don't give too much attention to the notion of control. It is not fruitful. Set the expectations, the plan. But be aware that things will not always work out as per the set plan. It is only natural to hold the feeling of frustrations and disappointment as a result. But then realize that these feelings are only temporary, find ways to stay calm amidst disappointment. And definitely, a way to not do that is finding the right expectations to set ‚Äî there's no <em>right</em> way to do that. </p><p>I have found my ways to stay calm amidst the disappointments. I listen to my favourite music, I write in my diary, I meditate. At times, I simply get back to the work I love. All these acts calm me down. What are the actions that do the same for you?</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Hello Friend, </p><p>I have recently moved back to my permanent address ‚Äî the place I have been calling home for the past ten years. It was precisely <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/2020/08/19/233840.html\">a year ago</a> that I had shifted to my <em>original </em>hometown. My wife and I wanted to be closer to our parents in these uncertain times. Good that we did. We ploughed through some of the toughest times with the support of the extended family. The sheer burden of the unknown and uncertainty would have crushed the lonely and separated souls.</p><p>Even though the closeness to the family was welcoming, the place you call your home always lends innate warmth. You feel calm, <em>at home</em>, free of some strange burden. Possibly, it is because of the familiarity of the surroundings. Or maybe it is because you have fallen in love with your abode over the many years of togetherness. Whatever the reason, things generally <em>feel </em>right.</p><p>That has been the experience for me for the past week. The period when I was away from this place appears way back in history. Is it not spectacular that you can so easily get habituated to the change in your surroundings?</p><p>That said, the drive back was full of anxiety. The ride, itself, was ¬†uneventful ‚Äî instead, we welcomed the chance to spend a pleasant 12 hours on the road. It was the inside that was churning with thoughts. I was petrified, thinking about the state the home would be in. Would it be covered knee-deep in the dust? Or full of cobwebs? With pests running everywhere? The fear of the unknown was nibbling my heart within. Just the thought of the sheer work we <em>may</em> have to put in to make the place liveable made me uncomfortable.</p><p>As I unlocked the main door and stepped inside, I realized I was foolish to let these thoughts burden my mind. Of course. Our home is not somewhere in the wild, open for unruly animals to pry at. It is part of a gated community. No cockroaches or spiders were running around the house. The dust that I was so terrified of was barely visible. I could feel it was there. But cleaning that was far from the back-bending chore that I imagined it to be. The home was just the way we had left it, our own. Calm.</p><p>Anyway, the place is back to being our home again. Now, this is also a time to settle into a new routine. A change of setting calls for a change in the way I was leading my life for the past year. I have already got my mornings back ‚Äî a familiar, peaceful morning is when I am writing this letter in. Now, it is time to handle the other phases of the day.</p><p>With that update out of the way, here is the selection of three brilliant essays on life for this week.</p><hr><h3 id=\"%E2%80%9Cthe-capital-t-truth%E2%80%9D-by-david-foster-wallace-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20080213082423/http://www.marginalia.org/dfw_kenyon_commencement.html\">‚ÄúThe Capital T Truth‚Äù by David Foster Wallace</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>[I]t is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead of getting hypnotized by the constant monologue inside your own head (may be happening right now). Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts clich√© about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old clich√© about quote the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.</blockquote><h3 id=\"%E2%80%9Cwhy-go-out%E2%80%9D-by-sheila-heti-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://www.sheilaheti.com/whygoout2/\">‚ÄúWhy Go Out?‚Äù by Sheila Heti</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>I‚Äôm always super-aware of how whenever I go out into the world, or whenever I get involved in a relationship, my idea of who I <em>think</em> I am utterly collides with the reality of who I actually am. And I continue to go out even though who I am always comes up short. I always prove myself to be less generous, less charming, less considerate, not as bold or energetic or intelligent or courageous as I imagined in my solitude. And I‚Äôm always being insulted, or snubbed, or disappointed.</blockquote><blockquote>And yet, in some way, maybe this is better. Each of us could suffer the pangs of withdrawal from other people and gain the serenity of the non-smoker. We could be demi-gods in our little castles, all alone, but perhaps, deep down, none of us really wants that. Maybe the only cure for self-confidence and courage is humility. Maybe we go out <em>in order </em>to<em> </em>fall short, because we want to learn how to be <em>good</em> at being people, and moreover, because we want to <em>be </em>people.</blockquote><h3 id=\"%E2%80%9Chow-to-live-on-twenty-four-hours-a-day%E2%80%9D-by-arnold-bennett-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://dev.misuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/ebooks/bennett_arnold_how_to_live_on_24_hours_a_day.pdf\">‚ÄúHow to Live on Twenty-Four Hours a Day‚Äù by Arnold Bennett</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>A failure or so, in itself, would not matter, if it did not incur a loss of self-esteem and of self-confidence. But just as nothing succeeds like success, so nothing fails like failure. Most people who are ruined are ruined by attempting too much. Therefore, in setting out on the immense enterprise of living fully and comfort- ably within the narrow limits of twenty-four hours a day, let us avoid at any cost the risk of an early failure. I will not agree that, in this business at any rate, a glorious failure is better than a petty success. I am all for the petty success. A glorious failure leads to nothing; a petty success may lead to a success that is not petty.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>You, my reader with a keen eye, must have noticed that this issue <em>looks</em> slightly different.

I have come to realize that no platform does it perfectly.</p><p>I look for these features in an editor from any platform before I select it. It needs to have a simple editor that works well for posts of any length, works well from a device of any form. It needs to support building drafts before posts are published. It needs to support a simple editing workflow. That's it. And even these simple needs are not fulfilled by a single platform.</p><p>WordPress has a decent mobile app, supporting all the necessary features of the platform. But the Gutenberg block editor is so convoluted to work with even on desktops that working with it on a mobile device is an absolute pain. It has too many bells and whistles that a blogger with simple text writing needs rarely uses. It is good to capture the ideas in short and expand on them on a desktop. No wait, the editor is pain even on desktop.</p><p>The static site generators like Hugo, Jekyll, Eleventy etc. need a CMS to be tacked on to them. Sure, you can choose a CMS of your choice, but for me, the experience never worked well. I have tried multiple static site generators, but the overall publishing workflow is unnecessarily complicated for my simple needs.</p><p>Of course, there is always an option to use a text editor of your choice on your machine and publish the posts from the editors ‚Äì if the integration exists for your selected platform that is. But that works best when you draft a post from a single machine. For me, that's typically not the case. For example, just this post has been written across three different devices ‚Äì a web-based CMS is a must for me.</p><p>Another promising option is connecting to IndieWeb and using any Micropub clients to publish to your sites. But unfortunately, after years of enabling all my sites with IndieWeb components and publishing via Micropub clients, I have come to realize that none is, by design, a CMS in any form. I find them lacking in supporting creation of drafts to work on later or editing of existing posts.</p><p>Sure, it has all the definitions for you to build such a system over, but that's an unnecessary overhead that I am not ready to sign up for.</p><p>Micro.blog simplies hosting of a simple blog. It has a pretty decent iOS app, and a suite of well-defined APIs. A few third-party apps have already been build over those APIs. But the platform lacks a good editor ‚Äì its editor is too basic for any post longer than a regular micro post. Sure, it works. But barely. On a mobile device, it does not work at all. The recommendation seems to be to use any of the mobile apps, but they all lack the features I need.</p><p>When I moved my blog to Micro.blog, I had published <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/2020/10/27/224951.html\">this concern</a>.</p><blockquote>I wonder if I would be ok to post mainly from mobile, but as a regular micropub post. WordPress always allowed me to post so much more. I am not sure what m.b allows. It should be good enough, but is it really? That would be a test.</blockquote><p>Unfortunately, I have realized that the platform doesn't pass that test, wholly. The editing experience remains poor for the long form posts ‚Äì both from a desktop and a mobile device. It's a great system with a promising base, but still has a long way to go before I can use it for the longer form content.</p><p>So where does this leave me?</p><p>I have been struggling a lot from the beginnning to find that one good platform that addresses all my needs mentioned above. But, unfortunately, I have failed to find a single one that does all the aspects well. I love Micro.blog as it solves my simple needs of hosting with a no-nonsense platform for blog. It works great for micro posts ‚Äì I can live with the mobile workflow for such short posts.</p><p>And I have recently fallen in love with Ghost for the long-form needs. It has a great editor on both the desktop and mobile devices, it has a brilliant CMS for my drafting and editing needs and is a solid platform all-round that I can host myself. WordPress failed big time in that aspect.</p><p>So, at least for the foreseeable future, here's how my posting is going to be. Micro.blog for micro-posts. Self-hosted Ghost for long-form posts, that includes my newsletter.</p><p><strong>Why a special space for long-form writing you may ask?</strong></p><p>I believe the choice of your blogging platform affects the type of posts you write. If the writing experience you have with a platform does not suit a particular form, you will invariably <a href=\"https://amitgawande.com/2021/07/20/i-dislike-the.html\">stop writing those posts</a>. </p><p>My love for writing words is satiated only by the long-form posts. That love is also the reason why I started writing on the web in the first place. I can't stop writing them just because the platform I choose <em>for my convinience</em> does not support such writing well.</p>\n",

It is fiendishly difficult to stay a writer. To string words together, day in day out, that would be meaningful. To be inspired to do so every day. To not get lost in the deluge of ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù posts that are anything but. </p><p>Each week, I dig through the endless archives of the Internet to find those few fascinating posts, which I deliver as issues of this newsletter to assist a writer to stay inspired. This is what I had written while introducing the newsletter as part of <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/lets-dwell-in-writing-history/\">the first issue</a>.</p><blockquote>There are times when we [the creative people] get stuck and look for inspiration. There are times when we wish that finding help was simpler.

I will also feature one writer that inspires me to write more, along with some of their writing.</blockquote><p>I have struggled many a time for inspiration, for guidance. I often wished if only there was a hidden dole of helpful articles and directions that will keep me interested, motivated to trudge along. Slanting Nib &amp; A Keyboard (referred interchangeably as Slanting Nib) will attempt to be that nudge for me first. My wish is it manages to do the same for the writer in you, manages to inspire the words in you.</p><p><em>Slanting Nib</em> will be delivered every Sunday at 5 PM UTC. Featuring a personal letter and essays about something close to me, along with three thoughtfully curated posts. That's all. Each issue aims to be interesting enough to be worthy of your time without becoming too long to be a burden, a drag.</p><h2 id=\"what-can-i-expect-in-each-issue\">What can I expect in each issue?</h2><p>Each issue generally follows some theme. The first issue focused on the history of writing, for example; the second one presented a few inspiring words from masters. As long as I could, I intended to maintain a common thread that connects all the posts included in an issue. </p><p>However, I soon realized that I needed to make the newsletter more about my thoughts. Make it personal. So in addition, I have started drafting a warm letter for the readers. I follow it up by a section of featured writing with a maximum of 3 articles. All the articles will be meaningful. I will make it a point that neither is a listicle of any form. Or one from the myriad of productivity hacks.</p><h2 id=\"what-if-i-have-feedback\">What if I have feedback?</h2><p>I would love to hear from you. If you come across something that you think would be the right fit for an issue, do send the recommendations to me. If you find something incorrect or some part that doesn‚Äôt work, don‚Äôt hesitate to let me know. And of course, if you like something I have included in the newsletter issue, or it helped you in some way, I would love to hear about that too.</p><p>Just hit reply to the issue or <a href=\"mailto:amit.w.gawande@gmail.com\">email me</a> with any recommendations or tips, writer or tools.

				"content_text": "<p>Isn't it odd that we can't decide on a consistent content rating system across all the countries? I know I <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/2020/11/12/i-dont-understand.html\">have ranted about this</a> a many times before this. But I just can't wrap my head around the fact that we, supposedly smart humans, haven't figured out a way yet to addresses such a trivial aspect of our film watching experience.</p>\n<p>\n  How difficult is it to say that this content is made for children 6 years and above? Or 13 years and above?\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>\n  I know. I'm ignoring the fact that all nations are not governed the same. They have individual definitions and expectations of freedom. Oversimplifying the problem at hand may not take us anywhere. The least I can do at least is to check <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_picture_content_rating_system\">which countries handle this rating problem the best</a>. \n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>\n  I find it fascinating that Turkey has the simplest content rating system. These are the rating ‚Äî <i>General Audience, 6+, 10+, 13+, 16+, 18+</i>. Austria is in the same league ‚Äî <i>Unrestricted, 6, 10, 12, 14, 16</i>. Russia's not too far behind, too ‚Äî <i>0+, 6+, 12+, 16+, 18+</i>. \n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>India has a simple range ‚Äî <i>U, UA, A, S</i>. But those characters are meaningless. How is one to map them to the age of the child?</p>\n<p>United States follows an even more muddled system ‚Äî <i>G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17</i>. That's complication is unnecessary. It's unfortunate that those are the ratings that are most widely followed.</p>\n<p>\n  A couple of curious cases. South Africa has these categories ‚Äî <i>A, PG, 7‚Äì9PG, 10‚Äì12PG, 13, 16, 18, X18, XX</i>. Plus these sub-descriptors ‚Äî <i>S, L, V, P, N, H, D, SV</i>. Wow! I am sure a significant post-production budget goes towards arriving at the right rating for a film.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>And finally, of course, China. It has no official rating system. There are only two categories ‚Äî suitable for all ages and banned.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\n  Here are a few additional observations and a proposal. 6, 16 and 18 are the most commonly agreed boundaries for the films. Only a few countries have any ranges beyond 18.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>\n  So, if we manage to find an agreeable boundary between 6 ad 16, we should be able to cover major countries with these ratings ‚Äî \n  <i><b>0+, 6+, 12+, 16+, 18+</b></i>\n  . I am sure folks smarter than me will find a better way of conveying all why this system should work. Or convince me why this will never work.\n  <br />\n</p>\n",

				"title": "On Thinking in Long Form",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>A common sentiment shared by most bloggers is that blogging is not supposed to be work. It needs to feel natural, flow freely, like a mirror reflection of a writer's mind. It needs to be a stream, a log of a thousand thoughts published on the web as they arrive. They do not need any adornment, any context. Because this medium is first for self. <em>Write for yourself </em>is the first suggestion every person publishing on the web gets.</p><p>I do connect with the sentiment, yet I believe the suggestion doesn't address all facets of writing. Personally, I love <em>blogging</em>, but I also love <em>writing </em>long form posts<strong>. </strong>The only way I know of to get better at an activity is to do it regularly. So, it was natural for me to <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/07/20/i-dislike-the.html\">get frustrated</a> with the fact that I do not publish long form posts any more. Colin had a detailed <a href=\"https://colinwalker.blog/?date=2021-07-20\">reply,</a> again reiterating the same sentiment.</p><blockquote>I have also found that I write less long form content but feel it's more a reflection of the way I blog now rather than due to any external influence. Writing without titles, writing in thoughts rather than posts, means that each item is only as long as it needs to be.</blockquote><p>He does acknowledge that he too gets frustrated at times, but he has found a way to address his need via a newsletter that he regularly publishes.</p><blockquote>I sometimes get a little frustrated at the dearth of longer posts as it means I'm not going in to any real depth, but then I have the muse-letter to explore things further. That doesn't mean that longer form posts don't appear on the blog, it is more a \"stream of consciousness\" affair. And that suits me for now.</blockquote><p>Sure, a blog needs to be just that ‚Äî a ‚Äústream of consciousness‚Äù ‚Äî but what if it makes a person stop thinking deep and just jot down the thoughts as they come? Without revisiting them to expand on them? A writer, needs to provide his thoughts space to evolve. He needs a place where he can borrow time and think deep. A place where he can knit a few ideas together and publish a coherent essay. A blog post, for sure, is not that.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, and I repeat, I love blogging. But I also like to think deep. Write posts that are more than my thoughts, out there for the world to consume as part of some timeline. There was a time that I used to post longer posts pretty regularly. I had drafts that I worked on for days. Read more, expanded on the original idea. A need for such workflow doesn't exist any more. I recently <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/07/20/i-am-reading.html\">wrote</a>.</p><blockquote>I am reading many people's writing process today and am absolutely stunned at how simple my writing needs are. I don't write drafts after drafts in any tool. All my drafts are one line ideas in my notebook or saved articles with tags \"to-write\". I find time for writing and complete a post about an idea or article. For that matter, most of my posts are spontaneous -- I get a thought and I put it down into a post.</blockquote><p>Realizing how simplistic my needs are, I ended that post with this question, ‚Äú<em>what use do I have for the text editors any more?</em>‚Äù </p><p>I think that was a rhetorical question posed to myself. Do I want to post just the spontaneous thoughts or also at times go deep and word something more meaningful? I have always known that the answer to that question is <em>both</em>, but I haven't found a right balance to achieve that yet. The regularity of microposts lends me a feeling of achieving the writing goals, but as I look back at the archive, that achievement feels hollow.</p><p>All said, though, I need to separate the spontaneous posts from my long form ones. The former allows me to stay real, genuine. The latter challenges my creative self. My mind needs both the outlets. A single portal has failed to provide that, and am tired of attempting to string one. So, here's a start in that direction.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Hello Friend,</p><p>My daughter recently learnt how to ride a bicycle. I spent two weeks making her follow the basics, inspiring her to give up on the fear of falling. I had marked the first week to convince her that falling is how she will learn not to stay down. She should learn to get up and pedal again. <em>It‚Äôs OK if you fall, you won‚Äôt cherish the efforts otherwise.</em></p><p>Once she had that thought imbibed, all I had to do was hold her and run along. I ran like crazy, like I had not in ages. I ran, and then I ran some more. Until one fine morning when I let her loose and saw her pedal along. I jogged next to her, a proud smile on my face. In being a parent, I was reliving a phase of my childhood.</p><p>Yesterday, we rode our bicycles together, with her alongside me when we came across a kid learning with training wheels. I could read her eyes wonder<em> why didn‚Äôt I get those added wheels for balancing</em>. I planned to tell her that it would have taken her longer to learn with that support attached. My mind was already racing along, talking to her, telling her.</p><blockquote>The artificial sense of support holds you back, dear. Just like me running alongside you, never releasing you, will. I will always hold you back from riding away, from taking control of your path. I can make you aware of your fears, but it is you who has to surmount them.</blockquote><p>However, she never asked. I never said. Maybe, she already knew.</p><p>What are the training wheels in your life - supporting you but thereby preventing you from taking the flight? Anyway, with that said, here is a selection of three brilliant works of writing.</p><hr><h3 id=\"attitude-by-margaret-atwood-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://www.humanity.org/voices/commencements/margaret-atwood-university-toronto-speech-1983\">\"Attitude\" by Margaret Atwood</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>[N]obody ever tells you, but did you know that when you have a baby your hair falls out? Not all of it, and not all at once, but it does fall out. It has something to do with a zinc imbalance. The good news is that it does grow back in. This only applies to girls. With boys, it falls out whether you have a baby or not, and it never grows back in; but even then there is hope. In a pinch, you can resort to quotation, a commodity which a liberal arts education teaches you to treat with respect, and I offer the following: ‚ÄúGod only made a few perfect heads, and the rest lie covered with hair.‚Äù</blockquote><h3 id=\"bookshop-memories-by-george-orwell-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/bookshop-memories/\">\"Bookshop Memories\" by George Orwell</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>Many of the people who came to us were of the kind who would be a nuisance anywhere but have special opportunities in a bookshop. For example, the dear old lady who ‚Äòwants a book for an invalid‚Äô (a very common demand, that), and the other dear old lady who read such a nice book in 1897 and wonders whether you can find her a copy. Unfortunately she doesn‚Äôt remember the title or the author‚Äôs name or what the book was about, but she does remember that it had a red cover. But apart from these there are two well-known types of pest by whom every second-hand bookshop is haunted. One is the decayed person smelling of old breadcrusts who comes every day, sometimes several times a day, and tries to sell you worthless books. The other is the person who orders large quantities of books for which he has not the smallest intention of paying.</blockquote><h3 id=\"the-danger-of-lying-in-bed-by-mark-twain-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Danger_of_Lying_in_Bed\">\"The Danger of Lying in Bed\" by Mark Twain</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>I could read of railway accidents every day‚Äìthe newspaper atmosphere was foggy with them; but somehow they never came my way. I found I had spent a good deal of money in the accident business, and had nothing to show for it. My suspicions were aroused, and I began to hunt around for somebody that had won in this lottery. I found plenty of people who had invested, but not an individual that had ever had an accident or made a cent. I stopped buying accident tickets and went to ciphering. The result was astounding. THE PERIL LAY NOT IN TRAVELING, BUT IN STAYING AT HOME.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>Have any recommendations or feedback for me? I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Just hit reply, or you can even <a href=\"mailto:amit.w.gawande@gmail.com\">email me.</a></p><p>Thank you for reading and <em>sharing</em>.</p><p>-<em>Amit</em></p><p></p><p></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Hello Friend,</p><p>At the surface, this channel of communication feels so abstract. I don‚Äôt know whether you read this to the end; maybe you skim through for something of interest. Whatever <em>you</em> do, I feel as if I am writing a letter to an old friend. I bear no sense of entitlement just because I am writing an issue of a newsletter. On the contrary, I feel honoured that you allow space for my ripe thoughts in your inbox. I appreciate you taking the time, even if all you do is skim.</p><p>Anyway, I have, for many years, struggled to find time for things that matter, to make time for them in the routine. A routine that keeps getting tangled with each passing day. The problem has recently aggravated as I stay locked down at home, always connected. I pass the time without being aware of doing so. I know this isn‚Äôt healthy.</p><p>The book ‚ÄúMake Time‚Äù sets itself up with just that problem. It presents a set of tips and tricks ‚Äúfor improving focus, finding greater joy in your work, and getting more out of every day‚Äù. The self-help books tend to crow over whatever little they have to say. This one was among those rear ones that win me over by their simplicity. It <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/04/25/i-finished-reading.html?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">inspired me</a> to bring in some simple changes to my routine.</p><p>To list a few, I follow a fixed sleep routine now; I exercise and meditate daily. My smartphone unlocks to a blank home screen with no apps, no widgets waiting to distract me. I spend not more than 2 hours on group meetings in a day. I am not letting others‚Äô priorities run my day.</p><p>Every morning, I write down a highlight that will bring some sense of satisfaction to the day. Every evening, I log out from all my devices and spend a good hour or two with my family at a fixed time.</p><p>And the list goes on. In short, I desire to be conscious of how I spend my time. I have made many minor shifts in my routine in the last month. Do I see any gains? I am not judging yet. But I am leading my life at the very least.</p><p>Anyway, I hope this letter inspires you to contemplate whether you are doing the same with your life - <em>consciously living it</em>. With that said, here is a selection of three brilliant works of writing.</p><hr><h3 id=\"this-is-the-life-by-annie-dillard-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.billemory.com/dillard/dillard.html?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">\"This Is The Life\" by Annie Dillard</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>Who is your ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù? Chess masters scarcely surround themselves with motocross racers. Do you want aborigines at your birthday party? Or are you serving yak-butter tea? Popular culture deals not in its distant past, or any other past, or any other culture. You know no one who longs to buy a mule or be named to court or thrown into a volcano.</blockquote><blockquote>So the illusion, like the visual field, is complete. It has no holes except books you read and soon forget. And death takes us by storm. What was that, that life? What else offered? If for him it was contract bridge, if for her it was copyright law, if for everyone it was and is an optimal mix of family and friends, learning, contribution, and joy of making and ameliorating what else is there, or was there, or will there ever be?</blockquote><h3 id=\"against-joie-de-vivre-by-phillip-lopate-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B07_vmO6k034dUcwVl9WNm43TUk/view?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">\"Against Joie de Vivre\" by Phillip Lopate</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>The truth is, most wisdom is embittering. The task of the wise person cannot be to pretend with false naivet√© that every moment is new and unprecedented, but to bear the burden of bitterness which experience forces on us with as much uncomplaining dignity as strength will allow. Beyond that, all we can ask of ourselves is that bitterness not cancel out our capacity still to be surprised.</blockquote><h3 id=\"on-running-after-one%E2%80%99s-hat-by-g-k-chesterton-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://essays.quotidiana.org/chesterton/running_after_ones_hat/?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">\"On Running After One‚Äôs Hat\" by G. K. Chesterton</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>Real pain, as in the case of being burnt at Smithfield or having a toothache, is a positive thing; it can be supported, but scarcely enjoyed. But, after all, our toothaches are the exception, and as for being burnt at Smithfield, it only happens to us at the very longest intervals. And most of the inconveniences that make men swear or women cry are really sentimental or imaginative inconveniences‚Äîthings altogether of the mind. For instance, we often hear grown-up people complaining of having to hang about a railway station and wait for a train. Did you ever hear a small boy complain of having to hang about a railway station and wait for a train? No; for to him to be inside a railway station is to be inside a cavern of wonder and a palace of poetical pleasures. Because to him the red light and the green light on the signal are like a new sun and a new moon. Because to him when the wooden arm of the signal falls down suddenly, it is as if a great king had thrown down his staff as a signal and started a shrieking tournament of trains.</blockquote><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>Have any recommendations or feedback for me?

The idea was to capture how I was doing right then. It was a welcome and much needed introspection. I didn't want to miss on the opportunity to revisit the answers from the last year and see what has changed.</p>\n<p>\n  It was a nice exercise. My thoughts a year back were so quite unfamiliar to what I am going through today. So, here's an update to the same set of questions. Again, I would love to hear how <i>you </i>are doing.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p> <strong>How are you taking care of yourself today?</strong> </p>\n<p>\n  Regular exercise and daily meditation. Reading a lot more fiction and non-fiction. I'm still listening to music and many audiobooks. Staying far away from news.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<strong>What part of your shelter-in-place residence have you come to appreciate the most?</strong> \n<p>\n  Garden at my home. The wooden swing at the top floor that overlooks the garden. \n  <br />\n</p>\n<strong>What surprising thing have you been stocking up on (that isn‚Äôt toilet paper)?</strong> \n<p>\n  Biscuits. Lots of them.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<strong>What‚Äôs a story‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâfrom a book, a movie, an article, a conversation‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthat you‚Äôve been gripped by recently? Why did it capture you?</strong> \n<p>\n  Nothing grips me any more. Maybe I have grown numb?\n  <br />\n</p>\n<strong>What habit have you started, or broken, during the quarantine?</strong> \n<p>\n  I have stopped staying awake late into the Friday and Saturday nights. That was one habit I had, stay up late either mindlessly watching something or working on side projects.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>As an effect, I am following a pretty routine. Get a calming and wholesome sleep.</p>\n<p><strong>Which specific place in your neighborhood are you most looking forward to visiting once this is all over?</strong> </p>\n<p>\n  Again, every part of the neighbourhood. Especially malls and the restaurants.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<strong>What‚Äôs the easiest part about the quarantine?</strong> \n<p>\n  Getting bored. And getting creative.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<strong>What are some things you have realized that you don‚Äôt really need?</strong> \n<p>\n  Cash. And fancy clothes. What I wear at home is often good enough even outside.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<strong>What‚Äôs something you own that feels useful?</strong> \n<p>\n  Kindle. Headphones.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<strong>What is your COVID-19 nickname/alter-ego?</strong> \n<p>\n  Calm workaholic.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<strong>What problem‚Äîeither yours, or something more global ‚Äîdo you wish you could solve?</strong> \n<p>\n  Global Stupidity. Political Divisiveness. Natural Selfishness.\n  <br />\n</p>\n",

My mind and body have endured a lot of stress in the past three months, making me realize the importance of staying fit. It was time that I took control and regain the lost energy.</p><p>Keeping up with such a resolution is not easy. My mind desires to wander; my body demands to lay back. <em>You are so tired; why do you want to exert yourself more? </em>It questions. And I have often given in to their desires and demands. Not this time, though.</p><p>For more than a month now, I have been on the lookout for ways to help myself with this fight. To find ways that work for me. To not give up on the resolve when the things that aren‚Äôt working out. I have read a series of articles and books that have helped many that I know. I am consciously implementing what they suggest, attempting before deciding.</p><p>Very often, I have fallen prey to prematurely make up my mind about the suggestions from others. <em>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt share that surrounding. I am in such a different phase of my life. That‚Äôs too costly. Or too difficult. Or too stupid.‚Äù </em>My mind always finds some way to convince me why the suggested strategies won‚Äôt work. A month back, it was time for some introspection.</p><p>Is it not ironic that a tired mind and body doesn‚Äôt want to be taken care of?</p><p>Anyway, here‚Äôs a selection of this edition‚Äôs three brilliant works of writing. I hope they trigger some inspiration for your mind to churn a few happy, positive thoughts.</p><hr><h3 id=\"politics-and-the-english-language-by-george-orwell-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/\">\"Politics and the English Language\" by George Orwell</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts. The point is that the process is reversible. Modern English, especially written English, is full of bad habits which spread by imitation and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the necessary trouble. If one gets rid of these habits one can think more clearly, and to think clearly is a necessary first step toward political regeneration: so that the fight against bad English is not frivolous and is not the exclusive concern of professional writers.</blockquote><h3 id=\"things-we-think-we-know-by-chuck-klosterman-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/features/chuck-klostermans-america/ESQ0307klosterman\">\"Things We Think We Know\" by Chuck Klosterman</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>We adore stereotypes, and we desperately need them to fabricate who we are (or who we are not). People need to be able to say things like, ‚ÄúAll stereotypes are based on ignorance,‚Äù because expressing such a sentiment makes them enlightened, open-minded, and incredibly unpleasant. Meanwhile, their adversaries need the ability to say things such as, ‚ÄúLike it or not, all stereotypes are ultimately based in some sort of reality,‚Äù because that kind of semilogic can justify their feelings about virtually anything. Nobody really cares what specific stereotype they happen to be debating; what matters more is how that label was spawned, because that defines its consequence. It raises a fundamental query about the nature of existence: Is our anecdotal understanding of the world founded on naivete, or is it built on dark, unpopular truths?</blockquote><h3 id=\"once-more-to-the-lake-by-e-b-white-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://genius.com/E-b-white-once-more-to-the-lake-annotated\">\"Once More to the Lake\" by E. B. White</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>We had a good week at the camp. The bass were biting well and the sun shone endlessly, day after day. We would be tired at night and lie down in the accumulated heat of the little bedrooms after the long hot day and the breeze would stir almost imperceptibly outside and the smell of the swamp drift in through the rusty screens. Sleep would come easily and in the morning the red squirrel would be on the roof, tapping out his gay routine. <a href=\"https://genius.com/E-b-white-once-more-to-the-lake-annotated\">I kept remembering everything, lying in bed in the mornings‚Äìthe small steamboat that had a long rounded stern like the lip of a Ubangi</a>, and how quietly she ran on the moonlight sails, when the older boys played their mandolins and the girls sang and we ate doughnuts dipped in sugar, and how sweet the music was on the water in the shining night, and what it had felt like to think about girls then.</blockquote><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>Have any recommendations or feedback for me?

				"content_text": "<p>\n  Music is the only time machine out there. You come across a song or an album, and a flood of memories and emotions come rushing at you. You almost relive those priceless moments. Exaggeration? I think not.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>You get transported back to the time when you listened to that song the first time. Or when you spent hours and days crooning along, the album on repeat mode. You vividly feel your surrounding from that time. The place you were at. The mental state you were in. <i>The happiness of loneliness</i>. Or the craziness with those few, old friends. You remember the moments that matter, the moments that are tucked deep within your heart.</p>\n<p>I am not saying anything groundbreaking here. Each one of us has experienced this ability of music. Many have worded it a lot more beautifully even.</p>\n<p>\n  I consider this a superpower and am reminded of this every few months. Most often, the time I hop back to is the early 2000s, the time that I cherish the most. It was a new phase of my student life. A period with a lot more independence. A period when my thoughts were moulded. Today was one such day. \n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>\n  A lesser-known <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2gh7v41s3eKkw5fTdfMEYR?si=m0cw1icYQM-Cvy67sPigOw\">A.R. Rahman album</a>. It's not even among one of his best. But it's close to me, though. I can't explain why; maybe the feeling of the songs resonated with what I was going through in my life. I didn't understand a word of those lyrics; it was the first non-Hindi, non-English album I listened to. But as they say, music has no language. And good music doesn't need words to convey an emotion.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>Sure, the album doesn't evoke the same feelings in me today. But I momentarily relive that unfamiliar phase of freedom every time. Just as I did today. </p>\n",

This weekend was one such occasion.</p>\n<p>For one, A. R. Rahman was going to be on the show as a guest. I love this man and his music. I won't miss a chance to watch the people contending to be good at singing attempt the maestro's brilliant tunes. The episode did not disappoint -- a contestant attempted one of the trickiest songs ever composed by Rahman, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clVEQrCXocg\">Satrangi Re</a>. </p>\n<p>As the performance came to an end (and the director decided to stuff it with unnecessary stuff), a little dialogue happened at our home. The contestant mentioned the first album he purchased was Rahman's, and he wanted Rahman's autograph on the old audio cassette. My daughter looked on with her curiosity piqued by watching the object the guy was holding. She genuinely asked, \"what's a cassette, dad?\"</p>\n<p>Boy, I had a nostalgic few minutes. I explained all about how I used to listen to songs when I was a child. I showed her the images of the audio cassettes, up close and afar. But you know what she was most interested in? Sony Walkman.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/uploads/2021/de50c5fa3a.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"635\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I dearly wish I had not given away my Sony Walkman to one of my cousins. Sure, I had made her day by passing on the tech I did not need. But I loved my Walkman. And pleasing to see my daughter get fascinated by the beauty. And she has owned every type of iPod -- yet the retro-tech will always hold its charm.</p>\n<p>By the way, the contestant I mentioned above, Ashish Kulkarni, is too good a singer.

				"content_text": "<p>Hello Friend,</p><p>The last month was pretty exhausting for me. We had planned a family function at our home; the closest few were to gather after a long, long time. I would not have objected if we had delayed a get together of any form in these trying times of pandemic. However, this function was long overdue, and we could no longer avoid it. So with a slight uneasiness and a lot of uncertainty, we decided to go ahead with a smallish gathering.</p><p>Deep down, however, I was also anxiously awaiting to be surrounded by a few people after all. I wanted to take my mind away from the gloomy, saddening updates from the world over. This function lent the desired chance to do that. Isn‚Äôt it curious that the personal pressures allow you to be distracted, to momentarily stay aloof of the fact that the world around you is burning? Is it cynical? Selfish? Sure, it is. But sometimes selfishness is healthy for a burdened mind.</p><p>For a whole week, I was running around, planning for the event. I was exerting my body to the extreme. But the physical pain out of uninterrupted exertion is a lot less discomforting than the pain that any form of inertness inflicts on the mind.</p><p>As the day came to an end and I greeted adieus to my closest folks, I was left exhausted, but I had a big smile on my face. I felt a lot contented, at ease within. As if the difficult time had passed. So naive, yet freshening. If nothing else, I have accumulated a few memories that, surprisingly, aren‚Äôt blotted with the dull shadows of the pandemic.</p><p>Anyway, here‚Äôs a selection of this edition‚Äôs three brilliant works of writing. I hope they inspire you to word a few memories, a few uneasy thoughts of yours.</p><hr><h3 id=\"us-and-them-by-david-sedaris-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://legacy.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2004/jun/sedaris/usandthem.html\">\"Us and Them\" by David Sedaris</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>Because they had no TV, the Tomkeys were forced to talk during dinner. They had no idea how puny their lives were, and so they were not ashamed that a camera would have found them uninteresting. They did not know what attractive was or what dinner was supposed to look like or even what time people were supposed to eat. Sometimes they wouldn‚Äôt sit down until eight o'clock, long after everyone else had finished doing the dishes. During the meal, Mr. Tomkey would occasionally pound the table and point at his children with a fork, but the moment he finished, everyone would start laughing. I got the idea that he was imitating someone else, and wondered if he spied on us while we were eating.</blockquote><h3 id=\"%E2%80%9Cwhy-write%E2%80%9D-by-paul-auster-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/12/25/why-write?bxid=603f5e1eadfb3e5c2d381189&amp;cndid=63976050&amp;esrc=NYR_NEWSLETTER_TheNewYorkerThisWeek_217_SUB_SourceCode&amp;hasha=974dccbf118a9ee9846f4e9f16273ddd&amp;hashb=2e7d99c5217156b9d444f3ba82dec66826151414&amp;hashc=c0676801b83033dffafe5a20da91b23f26926ae8312e0303678dd3ad5ece83b0\">‚ÄúWhy Write?‚Äù by Paul Auster</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>It became a habit of mine never to leave the house without making sure I had a pencil in my pocket. It‚Äôs not that I had any particular plans for that pencil, but I didn‚Äôt want to be unprepared. I had been caught empty-handed once, and I wasn‚Äôt about to let it happen again. If nothing else, the years have taught me this: if there‚Äôs a pencil in your pocket, there‚Äôs a good chance that one day you‚Äôll feel tempted to start using it. As I like to tell my children, that‚Äôs how I became a writer.</blockquote><h3 id=\"it%E2%80%99s-silly-to-be-frightened-of-being-dead-by-diana-athill-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/23/-sp-diana-athill-its-silly-frightened-being-dead\">\"It‚Äôs silly to be frightened of being dead\" by Diana Athill</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>I can‚Äôt remember when I read, or was told, that he [Montaigne] considered it a good thing to spend a short time every day thinking about death, thus getting used to its inevitability and coming to understand that something inevitable is natural and can‚Äôt be too bad, but it was in my early teens, and it struck me as a sensible idea. Of course I didn‚Äôt set out to think about death in a regular way every day, but I did think about it quite often, and sure enough, it worked. Why coming to see death‚Äôs naturalness should have caused belief in an afterlife to melt away, I am unsure, but it did. Probably that belief had been no more than an unexamined acceptance of something said by a grownup: in a child‚Äôs life there are many things more important to question than the probability of reuniting after death with other dead people ‚Äì ideas that are tucked away on a back shelf of the mind like some object for which one has no use at present.</blockquote><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>Have any recommendations or feedback for me?

A male stork. The two mated and shortly afterward, the male stork left, as one would expect, being a migratory bird and all. But storks are also known for being serial monogamists; while they don‚Äôt mate for life, they tend to stick with the same partner so long as that partner is on the same migratory path. In this case, though, Malena had no migratory path, and the bird that happened across her nest seemed unlikely to return.</p>\n  <p>Until he did, a year later. And a year after that. And a year after that, too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n  Ah, love indeed is universal. And in this case, it literally has no boundaries. Such a pretty, happy story. To anyone who says long-distance relationship doesn't work, I have <i>another</i> real life story bookmarked now.\n  <br />\n</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Hello Friend,</p><p>After a prolonged slump in my productivity, I‚Äôve been writing a lot more recently. I‚Äôm not sure what has brought in this change. Some alteration in the environment I write in had stimulated such a turn around in the past. A new keyboard. A new platform. Or a new place.</p><p>However, my selection of tools has hardly changed this time. <em>It‚Äôs never the tools,</em> I keep telling myself. Such tool-induced changes in habits are short-lived.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://automatter.substack.com/p/the-less-you-own-the-less-owns-you\">recent quote from Halle Kaplan-Allen</a> is pretty profound in that sense.</p><blockquote>The best tool to achieve any task is the one that you are going to stick by. Tool proliferation leads to increased complexity, and increased complexity leads to productivity paralysis.</blockquote><p>I recently came across a sudden surge of posts where a new tool inspired many people to get back to writing. Each person had a new idea that the said tool would help them in. <em>‚ÄúThe simplicity kills the friction; that should help me write more,‚Äù</em> goes the thought. That line of thinking should work, sure. But for the majority of us, our minds aren‚Äôt wired that way.</p><p>Judy Blume says, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt write because you want to, but because you have to‚Äù. She is spot-on; I never <em>want</em> to write. I can‚Äôt force my mind to sit at the keyboard and fill the pages with words. I only write when I am emotionally involved in what I write. In short, I write best when I believe in what I am writing. Otherwise, all the words are hollow. The thoughts, meaningless. So, I welcome my recent creative phase.</p><p>Anyway, here‚Äôs a selection of this edition‚Äôs three brilliant works of writing. I hope they inspire you <em>to write as well as you can</em>.</p><hr><h3 id=\"a-personal-view-on-writing-%E2%80%93-by-judy-blume-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://judyblume.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/personal_view_judy_blume.pdf\">A Personal View on Writing ‚Äì by Judy Blume</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>I once met a woman who wanted to write. She told me she‚Äôd read 72 books about writing but she still couldn‚Äôt do it. I suggested that instead of reading books about writing, she read the best books she could find, the books that would inspire her to write as well as she could.</blockquote><blockquote>Those of us who write do it because there are stories inside us burning to get out. Writing is essential to our well-being. If you‚Äôre that kind of writer, never give up! If you start a story and it isn‚Äôt going well, put it aside. (We‚Äôre not talking about school assignments here.) You can start as many as you like because you‚Äôre writing for yourself. With each story you‚Äôll learn more. One day it will all come together for you.</blockquote><h3 id=\"the-perfection-of-the-paper-clip-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/05/the-history-of-the-paper-clip-it-was-invented-in-1899-it-hasnt-been-improved-upon-since.html\">The Perfection of the Paper Clip</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>Minimal, relentlessly plain, and instantly familiar to a contemporary eye even in an advertisement from 1894, its persistence has made the paper clip the epitome of the disposable, anonymous, manufactured object. It is made for secretaries, for assistants, for subordinates and gofers. It only became most useful once there were millions of pieces of paper that had to be grouped, but that also had to be taken apart again. The staple may contain more potential for physical harm, but the threat of the paper clip is Sisyphean: once you‚Äôve clipped the papers together, you‚Äôre probably going to have to unclip them, and then clip together some others, and then unclip those and keep going until you retire, or you get that break in your acting career. Perhaps if Microsoft had chosen an object less reminiscent of mindless toil, the optimism of its much-loathed Clippy office assistant would have seemed less demented, and thus less prime for ridicule.</blockquote><h3 id=\"how-to-tell-a-story-and-others-%E2%80%93-by-mark-twain-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3250/3250-h/3250-h.htm\">How to Tell a Story and Others ‚Äì by Mark Twain</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>The humorous story is told gravely; the teller does his best to conceal the fact that he even dimly suspects that there is anything funny about it; but the teller of the comic story tells you beforehand that it is one of the funniest things he has ever heard, then tells it with eager delight, and is the first person to laugh when he gets through. And sometimes, if he has had good success, he is so glad and happy that he will repeat the ‚Äúnub‚Äù of it and glance around from face to face, collecting applause, and then repeat it again. It is a pathetic thing to see.</blockquote><blockquote>Very often, of course, the rambling and disjointed humorous story finishes with a nub, point, snapper, or whatever you like to call it. Then the listener must be alert, for in many cases the teller will divert attention from that nub by dropping it in a carefully casual and indifferent way, with the pretence that he does not know it is a nub.</blockquote><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>Have any recommendations or feedback for me?

				"content_text": "<p>Hello Friend,</p><p>It‚Äôs been a while since I published the last issue. For me, neither 2020 signed off on a high note nor 2021 started with a blast. The many unwanted bumps through the challenging past three months forced me to push the reset across my projects.</p><p>Anyway, I plan to revive this newsletter, and I intend to call this an unrelated sequel to the original run. The first volume was <em>about</em> and <em>for</em> the writers, whereas I target a slightly wider audience with this reincarnation.</p><p>Each new volume of anything generally diverges on the theme; this one is no different. I‚Äôve covered all the aspects I‚Äôd planned for the first volume of this newsletter, the one I had tagged as ‚Äúa writer‚Äôs toolkit‚Äù. It is disrespectful on my part then to publish something that does not excite me - it cannot be engaging for you, the reader.</p><p><strong>What changes can you expect, then?</strong></p><p>Well, the soul stays the same. It‚Äôs the content and the context that changes. Each issue will still feature three fantastic works of writing, but I won‚Äôt restrict them to be <em>only about and around writing</em>. They will be curious at most times. At times, they will be profound. But engrossing they will be every single time.</p><p>With that said, here are the three featured writings for this week.</p><hr><h3 id=\"advice-to-youth-by-mark-twain-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://people.virginia.edu/~jdk3t/TwainAY.htm\">\"Advice to Youth\" by Mark Twain</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>Always obey your parents, when they are present. This is the best policy in the long run, because if you dont, they will make you. Most parents think they know better than you do, and you can generally make more by humoring that superstition than you can by acting on your own better judgment.</blockquote><h3 id=\"joy-by-zadie-smith-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"http://theessayexperiencefall2013.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/files/2013/09/Joy-by-Zadie-Smith.pdf\">\"Joy\" by Zadie Smith</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being the dog,‚Äù our child said recently, surprising us. She is almost three and all our private languages are losing their privacy and becoming known to her. Of course, we knew she would eventually become fully conscious, and that before this happened we would have to give up arguing, smoking, eating meat, using the Internet, talking about other people‚Äôs faces, and voicing the dog, but now the time has come, she is fully aware, and we find ourselves unable to change. ‚ÄúStop being the dog,‚Äù she said,‚Äúit‚Äôs very silly,‚Äù and for the first time in eight years we looked at the dog and were ashamed.</blockquote><h3 id=\"go-gentle-into-that-good-night-by-roger-ebert-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/roger-ebert/go-gentle-into-that-good-night\">\"Go Gentle Into That Good Night\" by Roger Ebert</a> ‚Üí</h3><blockquote>‚ÄúKindness‚Äù covers all of my political beliefs. No need to spell them out. I believe that if, at the end of it all, according to our abilities, we have done something to make others a little happier, and something to make ourselves a little happier, that is about the best we can do. To make others less happy is a crime. To make ourselves unhappy is where all crime starts. We must try to contribute joy to the world. That is true no matter what our problems, our health, our circumstances. We must try. I didn‚Äôt always know this, and am happy I lived long enough to find it out.</blockquote><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>Have any recommendations or feedback for me?

				"title": "Through the Dark Clouds - A Short Story",
				"content_html": "<p>The lady on the microphone announced in her squeaky voice, &ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Mumbai airport.&rdquo; Oas groaned, closed his eyes, and contorted his face like only an exasperated 75-year-old can. Having heard her numerous times in the last couple of hours, he was tired of listening to her any more.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Does she think I&rsquo;ve never been to an airport before?&rdquo; he muttered under his breath. &ldquo;Bah. I&rsquo;ve been on planes for longer than she&rsquo;s been on earth!&rdquo; The staff was running helter-skelter on the airport with some angst that Oas couldn&rsquo;t fathom. &ldquo;<em>Freaks</em>,&rdquo; he sighed in disappointment.</p>\n<p>The constant low hum of the music from the headphones of the young guy beside Oas didn&rsquo;t help his mood either. As the guy shuffled in his seat, the huge laptop on his lap brushed against Oas&rsquo;s arm again.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Do you want my lap too?&rdquo; Oas blurted out loudly as he knew the guy couldn&rsquo;t hear him. &ldquo;Take it, I am happy to help you save the world which is what I assume you must be doing,&rdquo; he continued muttering. The guy hardly budged.</p>\n<p>Bored of the one-way conversation, Oas got up and stood gawking at the hustle-bustle around. He was a lost alien amidst the time-poor professionals. He walked to a television screen in the lounge playing CNN. A news scroll read about a novel disease spreading through China. The main news being run on the channel though was about a kid at the Mumbai airport traveling alone. Oas massaged his forehead in disdain, wondered why this was news, and walked away.</p>\n<p>He began to stroll around the airport. He had to buy nothing, but he also dearly wanted to interact with another human being. He wandered through the Crosswords bookstore, hoping a salesperson would ask him if he needed any help. No one did. Lacking the patience to browse around the towering walls of disparate books, he walked straight to the bestseller section. He glanced at all the self-help books crowding the non-fiction racks. The fiction ones were full of tales from fantasy\nworlds. Oas was fond of neither; so he strolled out.¬†</p>\n<p>He saw a deserted coffee stall. Hoping that the person selling coffee would be as bored as he was, Oas walked to him. The person was seated on a low stool chair; to Oas&rsquo;s disappointment, even he was lost in his smartphone&rsquo;s screen.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s hot?&rdquo; Oas asked the guy with a wish it would trigger some small talk.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We only sell coffee here,&rdquo; responded the guy without glancing away from the glowing screen.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Do you serve it hot?&rdquo; Oas quipped.</p>\n<p>The guy hadn&rsquo;t looked at Oas yet; he didn&rsquo;t even now. He jerked his face towards the coffee vending machine and said, &ldquo;We serve it however this machine dispenses.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With all his hopes for even a meaningless interaction crushed, Oas ordered a cup. The guy shrugged in annoyance, got up and walked to the machine. He served the coffee with eyes as dull as sloth&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Sorry to put you through so much trouble, my friend,&rdquo; mocked Oas. The sarcasm in his voice was lost on the mindless guy. He responded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With a bitter taste in his mouth, Oas walked back to the gate buzzing now with the regular pre-boarding bustle. A lot of people had gotten up in the anticipation that the queuing would start soon. &ldquo;<em>Would they prefer to stand up longer just to be ahead in the boarding queue?&quot;</em> Oas wondered. <em>&ldquo;Just so that they could sit inside the plane longer?&quot;</em> The rationality behind the thought had always stumped him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Mr Puri?&rdquo; Oas heard a soft voice calling for him. He turned to face a flight attendant, smiling a very plastic smile at him.¬† The nametag on her read &lsquo;Anjali&rsquo;. Oas stopped himself from telling her that she had unnecessarily puffed her face with makeup. She had helped Oas earlier at the check-in counter; he had stopped himself even then.¬†</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Would you please follow me?&rdquo; It sounded more like a command to Oas than a request.</p>\n<p>He looked at her, puzzled. He couldn&rsquo;t think of any reason why he should follow her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok, Anjali,&rdquo; he said curtly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need any help.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sir, we have a priority boarding policy for all the senior citizens,&rdquo; she spoke without letting her two pepper-red lips touch one another for long. &ldquo;We will get you on the plane first.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Oas stared at her like a child would at his examiner. <em>&ldquo;Why does the world make us elders feel a lot more helpless than we are?&quot;</em> He didn&rsquo;t have much choice though; the stewardess looked adamant.¬†</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Fine. But I would need to be taken care of. I don&rsquo;t want to get stuffed in and forgotten,&rdquo; instructed Oas.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t happen, sir.&rdquo; The plastic smile didn&rsquo;t leave Anjali&rsquo;s face.</p>\n<p>Oas followed her. He was stuffed into the plane. And forgotten.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Oas looked at the kid from the CNN news report boarding along with Anjali. He wished the kid wasn&rsquo;t sitting anywhere close to him. Sure, Oas was yearning for interaction with another human being, but he was convinced that kids didn&rsquo;t fit that category. He did not hate them. He just believed they were dispatched by God to make people live through misery right on earth for the sins they have committed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Kids are too clumsy,&rdquo; he used to tell his wife, Sara, &ldquo;and too stupid to spend any time with. All they can do is leave you more frustrated than you were before.&rdquo; Sara, on the other hand, believed they were godsent to spread joy amongst the grieving souls, to teach them valuable lessons about life. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why God sent us no child. We are not grieving, you see.&rdquo; She used to joke with tears soon shimmering in her eyes. Oas let her settle with her fantasy.</p>\n<p>Oas saw the kid follow Anjali till they reached right next to where he was seated. She started pushing the kid&rsquo;s backpack inside the overhead compartment. Oas dropped his face in his palm; the kid saw him do that.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Avik, this is your seat, right next to nice Mr Puri here,&rdquo; introduced Anjali. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you would enjoy your flight.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Oas saw the kid slide onto the seat next to him and blurt, &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Avik shuffled into his seat by the aisle. He looked towards the open overhead compartment. Then he stuck his neck out into the empty aisle. He wanted to see someone around; he didn&rsquo;t. Displeasure cloaked his innocent face. He then looked at Oas who had picked up a magazine and was clearly pretending to be engrossed in it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What are you reading, Mr Puri?&rdquo; Avik was looking curiously at Oas.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Nothing that will interest you,&rdquo; Oas answered curtly without looking at him once.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you like reading Mr Puri,&rdquo; continued Avik. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look too interested in that book. My mum says if you enjoy doing something, you are always very busy doing it. So much that you won&rsquo;t even answer a question from someone else.&rdquo; Avik had pulled out the envelope kept in the seatback pocket and rummaged through what was inside. &ldquo;I never answer my mum when I am watching cartoons, you know, because I looooveee cartoons.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Avik was doing nothing to thwart Oas&rsquo;s beliefs about kids, rather, he was only making them firmer. &ldquo;Why are you alone, kid? Why are you not with your mum?&rdquo; Oas asked while putting the magazine back into the envelope.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in Bangalore. My father is also in Bangalore,&rdquo; said Avik while pulling out the printed safety instruction manual.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Why are <em>you</em> not with your mum?&rdquo; Oas asked again, thinking, &ldquo;of course <em>kids never answer the question that&rsquo;s asked&rdquo;</em>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Because they are not in Mumbai?&rdquo; Avik shook his head a couple of times and continued staring at the pictures in the security manual. &ldquo;I was living with my grandma here. She is very old &ndash;&rdquo; Avik paused and looked at Oas&rsquo;s face again. &ldquo;Not as old as you, though. But she still says she can&rsquo;t fly; she says she is afraid.&rdquo; Avik wasn&rsquo;t accustomed to staying silent. &ldquo;I am not afraid at all. My mum says I am very strong.&rdquo; Oas himself had started rummaging through the envelope now, searching for\nheadphones that he could plug his ears with. &ldquo;She says I am stronger than all my friends in the school. Rohit, Sid, everyone. Neil does beat me sometimes, but I always hit him back. My mum says I am stronger than even my father. My father -&rdquo; Oas had found the headphones and had quickly plugged his ears shut. He looked at Avik; he could see his lips\nmove, but heard no sound at all. He breathed a sigh of relief. He was happy that he had booked a first-class ticket; at least they provided the customers noise-cancelling headphones.</p>\n<p>Oas saw Anjali standing by the gate welcoming the other passengers that were boarding the flight now. He watched a couple enter the flight with a baby. The father was walking in front carrying all the luggage. The new-mom was struggling to carry the baby through the narrow aisle without letting even its sock touch anybody around. <em>&ldquo;That kid&rsquo;s going to wail throughout the flight now.&quot;</em> Oas let out a deep sigh.</p>\n<p>The guy with the huge laptop under his arm and headphones over his head walked in next. Oas smirked looking at him. &ldquo;The Avenger,&rdquo; he muttered and chuckled at his joke.</p>\n<p>Oas felt a pat on his arm; Avik was gesturing at him to remove his headphones. Oas didn&rsquo;t want to, but Avik had shifted his attention to work the seat belt that was holding him in his place. Worried the kid would set himself free, he pulled them away and gave Avik a probing look.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what I was saying, Mr Puri?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t. You see &hellip;&rdquo; Oas pointed at his headphones. &ldquo;&hellip; I was listening to music. Now that is something I like doing, kid.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Why do you keep calling me &lsquo;kid&rsquo;? Everyone else calls me &lsquo;Avik&rsquo;. My mum says she spent many days thinking before she settled on that name. You know what it means?&rdquo; Without waiting for Oas to speak a word, he bent his arms, flexing his biceps. &ldquo;It means brave, just who I am, my mum says. But she always cries when she says that, though.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The last statement made Oas freeze in his place. He saw a moving image flash in front of his eyes; of Sara hunched down next to Oas, laughing and crying at the same time. <em>&ldquo;Oh, I know you are brave, Oas!&quot;</em> He could recall Sara lying to him, preparing him for something he just wasn&rsquo;t ready for.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Why does she cry?&rdquo; He asked Avik in a much softer voice suddenly.</p>\n<p>Avik shrugged, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He continued his assault on the seat belt.</p>\n<p>Oas continued to stare at the kid, gloomy thoughts clouding his mind. Feeling increasingly restless, he asked, &ldquo;Are you going back to your mum?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m. Grandma says my mum&rsquo;s missing me. She always misses me.&rdquo; Avik had given up on his fight with the seat belt. &ldquo;Who are you going back to?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No one. I am going back to being alone.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Alone? Do you like living alone? Don&rsquo;t you have a family? My mum says everyone has one.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The innocence in the kid&rsquo;s voice caught Oas off guard. &ldquo;I had, once. I don&rsquo;t now since my wife. . . uhmmm. . . you know - &quot; Oas wasn&rsquo;t sure if the kid was old enough to understand the concept of death. This was one more reason he didn&rsquo;t like spending time with kids. &ldquo;<em>They could keep making the mindless fart jokes around you, but say &lsquo;shit&rsquo; around a kid and the whole world starts judging you,&quot;</em> he always complained. Sara was good at manoeuvring such situations; Oas wasn&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What? Did your wife die?&rdquo;¬†</p>\n<p>Oas was taken aback by this unexpected straightforwardness. He gulped the heaviness of the moment down his throat and nodded.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But she did love you, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Oas nodded again. &ldquo;So, why are you alone then? She must be still around, you know?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Oas looked at the kid expressionless. His mind was full of questions that he knew he would get no answers for from this unripe mind.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My mum says the people that love you do not go anywhere even if they die. They do disappear but continue to stay around. They never leave you.&rdquo; He was busy unfolding and folding the tray table over his lap now. &ldquo;My mum says she also is never going to leave me alone. I don&rsquo;t know why she keeps saying that; I know she won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Everyone around had settled down into their seats now. A calmness spread through the plane that Oas didn&rsquo;t share. Uneasy, he stared out the window into the darkness outside, illuminated by the occasional flash of lightning. Within, he was storming through the dreary thoughts.</p>\n<p>Anjali was now ready with the security demonstrations. She was used to being ignored, but the kid craned his neck to take in every word she said. Oas, on the other hand, was lost in his thoughts.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Uhhh &hellip; Why do they rush through these security instructions? Do they even want people to understand them?&rdquo; Oas looked at him struggling with the seat belt again. He finally got it open and squeaked an enthusiastic &ldquo;yay&rdquo;.</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;Cabin crew, prepare for take-off please.&quot;</em> Oas heard the Captain announce. Avik was jumping up and down on his seat; he didn&rsquo;t look alone any more. Oas unbuckled his seat belt, stretched towards the kid and put him back tied to his seat belt. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you unbuckle the seat belt now. Your mum won&rsquo;t want you to do that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Avik settled back into his seat. Oas locked his stare at the darkness outside. The flight took off, passing through the stormy clouds. The raindrops pattered against the window and then stopped suddenly as the plane cut through the low dark clouds.</p>\n<p>Avik had unknowingly slid his hand around Oas&rsquo;s arm. Oas smiled at Avik. &ldquo;Your mum&rsquo;s right. You <em>are</em> a brave child.&rdquo;</p>\n",
				"content_text": "The lady on the microphone announced in her squeaky voice, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Mumbai airport.\" Oas groaned, closed his eyes, and contorted his face like only an exasperated 75-year-old can. Having heard her numerous times in the last couple of hours, he was tired of listening to her any more.\n\n\"Does she think I've never been to an airport before?\" he muttered under his breath. \"Bah. I've been on planes for longer than she's been on earth!\" The staff was running helter-skelter on the airport with some angst that Oas couldn't fathom. \"*Freaks*,\" he sighed in disappointment.\n\nThe constant low hum of the music from the headphones of the young guy beside Oas didn't help his mood either. As the guy shuffled in his seat, the huge laptop on his lap brushed against Oas's arm again.\n\n\"Do you want my lap too?\" Oas blurted out loudly as he knew the guy couldn't hear him. \"Take it, I am happy to help you save the world which is what I assume you must be doing,\" he continued muttering. The guy hardly budged.\n\nBored of the one-way conversation, Oas got up and stood gawking at the hustle-bustle around. He was a lost alien amidst the time-poor professionals. He walked to a television screen in the lounge playing CNN. A news scroll read about a novel disease spreading through China. The main news being run on the channel though was about a kid at the Mumbai airport traveling alone. Oas massaged his forehead in disdain, wondered why this was news, and walked away.\n\nHe began to stroll around the airport. He had to buy nothing, but he also dearly wanted to interact with another human being. He wandered through the Crosswords bookstore, hoping a salesperson would ask him if he needed any help. No one did. Lacking the patience to browse around the towering walls of disparate books, he walked straight to the bestseller section. He glanced at all the self-help books crowding the non-fiction racks. The fiction ones were full of tales from fantasy\nworlds. Oas was fond of neither; so he strolled out.¬†\n\nHe saw a deserted coffee stall. Hoping that the person selling coffee would be as bored as he was, Oas walked to him. The person was seated on a low stool chair; to Oas's disappointment, even he was lost in his smartphone's screen.\n\n\"What's hot?\" Oas asked the guy with a wish it would trigger some small talk.\n\n\"We only sell coffee here,\" responded the guy without glancing away from the glowing screen.\n\n\"Do you serve it hot?\" Oas quipped.\n\nThe guy hadn't looked at Oas yet; he didn't even now. He jerked his face towards the coffee vending machine and said, \"We serve it however this machine dispenses.\"\n\nWith all his hopes for even a meaningless interaction crushed, Oas ordered a cup. The guy shrugged in annoyance, got up and walked to the machine. He served the coffee with eyes as dull as sloth's. \"Sorry to put you through so much trouble, my friend,\" mocked Oas. The sarcasm in his voice was lost on the mindless guy. He responded, \"It's alright.\"\n\nWith a bitter taste in his mouth, Oas walked back to the gate buzzing now with the regular pre-boarding bustle. A lot of people had gotten up in the anticipation that the queuing would start soon. \"*Would they prefer to stand up longer just to be ahead in the boarding queue?\"* Oas wondered. *\"Just so that they could sit inside the plane longer?\"* The rationality behind the thought had always stumped him.\n\n\"Mr Puri?\" Oas heard a soft voice calling for him. He turned to face a flight attendant, smiling a very plastic smile at him.¬† The nametag on her read 'Anjali'. Oas stopped himself from telling her that she had unnecessarily puffed her face with makeup. She had helped Oas earlier at the check-in counter; he had stopped himself even then.¬†\n\n\"Would you please follow me?\" It sounded more like a command to Oas than a request.\n\nHe looked at her, puzzled. He couldn't think of any reason why he should follow her. \"I'm ok, Anjali,\" he said curtly. \"I don't need any help.\"\n\n\"Sir, we have a priority boarding policy for all the senior citizens,\" she spoke without letting her two pepper-red lips touch one another for long. \"We will get you on the plane first.\"\n\nOas stared at her like a child would at his examiner. *\"Why does the world make us elders feel a lot more helpless than we are?\"* He didn't have much choice though; the stewardess looked adamant.¬†\n\n\"Fine. But I would need to be taken care of. I don't want to get stuffed in and forgotten,\" instructed Oas.\n\n\"Won't happen, sir.\" The plastic smile didn't leave Anjali's face.\n\nOas followed her. He was stuffed into the plane. And forgotten.\n\n---\n\nOas looked at the kid from the CNN news report boarding along with Anjali. He wished the kid wasn't sitting anywhere close to him. Sure, Oas was yearning for interaction with another human being, but he was convinced that kids didn't fit that category. He did not hate them. He just believed they were dispatched by God to make people live through misery right on earth for the sins they have committed.\n\n\"Kids are too clumsy,\" he used to tell his wife, Sara, \"and too stupid to spend any time with. All they can do is leave you more frustrated than you were before.\" Sara, on the other hand, believed they were godsent to spread joy amongst the grieving souls, to teach them valuable lessons about life. \"That's why God sent us no child. We are not grieving, you see.\" She used to joke with tears soon shimmering in her eyes. Oas let her settle with her fantasy.\n\nOas saw the kid follow Anjali till they reached right next to where he was seated. She started pushing the kid's backpack inside the overhead compartment. Oas dropped his face in his palm; the kid saw him do that.\n\n\"Avik, this is your seat, right next to nice Mr Puri here,\" introduced Anjali. \"I'm sure you would enjoy your flight.\"\n\nOas saw the kid slide onto the seat next to him and blurt, \"Thank you!\"\n\nAvik shuffled into his seat by the aisle. He looked towards the open overhead compartment. Then he stuck his neck out into the empty aisle. He wanted to see someone around; he didn't. Displeasure cloaked his innocent face. He then looked at Oas who had picked up a magazine and was clearly pretending to be engrossed in it.\n\n\"What are you reading, Mr Puri?\" Avik was looking curiously at Oas.\n\n\"Nothing that will interest you,\" Oas answered curtly without looking at him once.\n\n\"I don't think you like reading Mr Puri,\" continued Avik. \"You don't look too interested in that book. My mum says if you enjoy doing something, you are always very busy doing it. So much that you won't even answer a question from someone else.\" Avik had pulled out the envelope kept in the seatback pocket and rummaged through what was inside. \"I never answer my mum when I am watching cartoons, you know, because I looooveee cartoons.\"\n\nAvik was doing nothing to thwart Oas's beliefs about kids, rather, he was only making them firmer. \"Why are you alone, kid? Why are you not with your mum?\" Oas asked while putting the magazine back into the envelope.\n\n\"She's in Bangalore. My father is also in Bangalore,\" said Avik while pulling out the printed safety instruction manual.\n\n\"Why are *you* not with your mum?\" Oas asked again, thinking, \"of course *kids never answer the question that's asked\"*.\n\n\"Because they are not in Mumbai?\" Avik shook his head a couple of times and continued staring at the pictures in the security manual. \"I was living with my grandma here. She is very old --\" Avik paused and looked at Oas's face again. \"Not as old as you, though. But she still says she can't fly; she says she is afraid.\" Avik wasn't accustomed to staying silent. \"I am not afraid at all. My mum says I am very strong.\" Oas himself had started rummaging through the envelope now, searching for\nheadphones that he could plug his ears with. \"She says I am stronger than all my friends in the school. Rohit, Sid, everyone. Neil does beat me sometimes, but I always hit him back. My mum says I am stronger than even my father. My father -\" Oas had found the headphones and had quickly plugged his ears shut. He looked at Avik; he could see his lips\nmove, but heard no sound at all. He breathed a sigh of relief. He was happy that he had booked a first-class ticket; at least they provided the customers noise-cancelling headphones.\n\nOas saw Anjali standing by the gate welcoming the other passengers that were boarding the flight now. He watched a couple enter the flight with a baby. The father was walking in front carrying all the luggage. The new-mom was struggling to carry the baby through the narrow aisle without letting even its sock touch anybody around. *\"That kid's going to wail throughout the flight now.\"* Oas let out a deep sigh.\n\nThe guy with the huge laptop under his arm and headphones over his head walked in next. Oas smirked looking at him. \"The Avenger,\" he muttered and chuckled at his joke.\n\nOas felt a pat on his arm; Avik was gesturing at him to remove his headphones. Oas didn't want to, but Avik had shifted his attention to work the seat belt that was holding him in his place. Worried the kid would set himself free, he pulled them away and gave Avik a probing look.\n\n\"Did you hear what I was saying, Mr Puri?\"\n\n\"Sorry, I didn't. You see ...\" Oas pointed at his headphones. \"... I was listening to music. Now that is something I like doing, kid.\"\n\n\"Why do you keep calling me 'kid'? Everyone else calls me 'Avik'. My mum says she spent many days thinking before she settled on that name. You know what it means?\" Without waiting for Oas to speak a word, he bent his arms, flexing his biceps. \"It means brave, just who I am, my mum says. But she always cries when she says that, though.\"\n\nThe last statement made Oas freeze in his place. He saw a moving image flash in front of his eyes; of Sara hunched down next to Oas, laughing and crying at the same time. *\"Oh, I know you are brave, Oas!\"* He could recall Sara lying to him, preparing him for something he just wasn't ready for.\n\n\"Why does she cry?\" He asked Avik in a much softer voice suddenly.\n\nAvik shrugged, \"I don't know.\" He continued his assault on the seat belt.\n\nOas continued to stare at the kid, gloomy thoughts clouding his mind. Feeling increasingly restless, he asked, \"Are you going back to your mum?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm. Grandma says my mum's missing me. She always misses me.\" Avik had given up on his fight with the seat belt. \"Who are you going back to?\"\n\n\"No one. I am going back to being alone.\"\n\n\"Alone? Do you like living alone? Don't you have a family? My mum says everyone has one.\"\n\nThe innocence in the kid's voice caught Oas off guard. \"I had, once. I don't now since my wife. . . uhmmm. . . you know - \" Oas wasn't sure if the kid was old enough to understand the concept of death. This was one more reason he didn't like spending time with kids. \"*They could keep making the mindless fart jokes around you, but say 'shit' around a kid and the whole world starts judging you,\"* he always complained. Sara was good at manoeuvring such situations; Oas wasn't.\n\n\"What? Did your wife die?\"¬†\n\nOas was taken aback by this unexpected straightforwardness. He gulped the heaviness of the moment down his throat and nodded.\n\n\"But she did love you, didn't she?\" Oas nodded again. \"So, why are you alone then? She must be still around, you know?\"\n\nOas looked at the kid expressionless. His mind was full of questions that he knew he would get no answers for from this unripe mind.\n\n\"My mum says the people that love you do not go anywhere even if they die. They do disappear but continue to stay around. They never leave you.\" He was busy unfolding and folding the tray table over his lap now. \"My mum says she also is never going to leave me alone. I don't know why she keeps saying that; I know she won't.\"\n\nEveryone around had settled down into their seats now. A calmness spread through the plane that Oas didn't share. Uneasy, he stared out the window into the darkness outside, illuminated by the occasional flash of lightning. Within, he was storming through the dreary thoughts.\n\nAnjali was now ready with the security demonstrations. She was used to being ignored, but the kid craned his neck to take in every word she said. Oas, on the other hand, was lost in his thoughts.\n\n\"Uhhh ... Why do they rush through these security instructions? Do they even want people to understand them?\" Oas looked at him struggling with the seat belt again. He finally got it open and squeaked an enthusiastic \"yay\".\n\n*\"Cabin crew, prepare for take-off please.\"* Oas heard the Captain announce. Avik was jumping up and down on his seat; he didn't look alone any more. Oas unbuckled his seat belt, stretched towards the kid and put him back tied to his seat belt. \"Don't you unbuckle the seat belt now. Your mum won't want you to do that.\"\n\nAvik settled back into his seat. Oas locked his stare at the darkness outside. The flight took off, passing through the stormy clouds. The raindrops pattered against the window and then stopped suddenly as the plane cut through the low dark clouds.\n\nAvik had unknowingly slid his hand around Oas's arm. Oas smiled at Avik. \"Your mum's right. You *are* a brave child.\"\n",

And again, as has been the trend this year, the festivities are dampened by the phantom presence and talks of pandemic rampaging outside. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Each year, Ganesh Chaturthi, the long 10-day festival begins the season of festivals here in India. Everyone accepts that once the August dawns, it never is too long when we are already ringing the new year celebrations. We and our families are too busy with one festival after another. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This year the festivals did arrive, but the festivities were lacking. In India, we love celebrating our festivals outside, and with others. With our extended families and friends. We welcome them at home, and we don't hesitate to visit them and wish them loads of happiness.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So no surprise this year's festivals have been a lot different and a lot less fun. I understand the gravity of the situation that all us in the world find ourselves trapped in. But we Indians are known to dance away our fears and stresses together, as we celebrate our festivals.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From North to South, East to West of India, there are different names for the each (and at times the same) festival. But the purpose is common - celebrate the feeling of togetherness and of happiness that that togetherness brings to us. In that sense, this year has been dampening. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyway, Navratri began yesterday. Unlike each year, we are all working from home and hence have got a chance <a href=\"https://amitgawande.com/slacking-at-hometown/\">to be with our parents</a>. Usually, my wife and my mother fast throughout these nine days of Navratri. They are not changing there routine, they will fast even this year. To keep me appreciative of how difficult that is, I have decided to fast today. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But the DJs blaring the loud sounds from the <em>pandals </em>set up for Garba are missing this year. Also missing are the endless debates between left and right on how we should stop spreading the noise pollution. Missing are the colourful stalls selling Gagra cholis and missing is the excitement of getting ready as per the colour schedule for each Garba night.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sure, I understand the reason for all the gloom and also realize that we have bigger problems in front of us. But I abhor this year because it's stripping away the opportunities from us to celebrate and gain the strength we need to face the problems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That sentiment is a lot stronger for me in today's times of a pandemic that spreads by touching any of the open holes on a human's face. I'm tensed anytime I'm to touch my own face these days, especially if I don't have a hand wash or sanitizer around. I hate this crazy, fucking virus. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can stop eating particular meat or can boil &amp; reboil the water before drinking it. You can kill all the mosquitos around or have yourself bathed in repellant. But how the fuck do you not touch your own face? That's like asking your kid to not put herself in harm's way - she invariably will.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyway, with the bottled up frustration out of the way, my dislike for shopping for deodorant isn't new. So much so that it's no longer just a harmless dislike, it's a feeling of extreme hate. How the hell do you decide if a deodorant is good or not? I don't know how it's done at other places, but here in India, trying out a fragrance from a tester pack is pretty common while shopping for a deodorant. Everybody does it. Everybody apparent can do it. Except me. I never learned how to keep the fragrances separate. Once I've tried two, everything smells the same to my picky nose - you might as well make me smell the water and still get a comment from me after that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The way-out for me earlier was that I would only try a couple and select one from those. I can't say it always works - I end up choosing one that smells the worst. <em>Too strong or too mild or yuck. </em>These are the only reactions I get from my family. I haven't let that affect me until now - I have managed to convince myself that no one likes how the other smells. As long as I'm happy with how I smell - <em>or there's a complete lack of any form of smell for that matter</em> - I was fine. So I bought whatever smelled best for me or didn't smell at all from the two I tried.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This trial for fragrances is out of the picture in the pandemic times. There just are too many logistical problems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What's the other way then? You can for once judge a book by its cover or title, but there's no way one can judge a deodorant by its canister. I mean all fucking look the same. You can't select one because its nozzle opens up funny or the shape of the container is \"different\". The content isn't.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And what's with naming the fragrances? Dark Temptation, Sea Drift, Thunder Bolt, Regal Burst, Voyage. When every fragrance could be named as simply as \"strong\", \"mild\" and \"mildest\", fact that marketing would spend so much time and money to come up with these names makes no sense to me. How am I supposed to select between Dark Temptation and Gold Temptation?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And the money that marketing spends on the advertisement for men's deodorant must absolutely go down the drain. The only message they aim to deliver apparently is <em>put this on and be a magnet for girls</em>? Or be sensual? Or be \"irresistible\"? On the other hand, how can you even advertise for fragrance? The only thing you can say is it smells good.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Or simply strong, mild or mildest. I'm telling you, it is simple to solve this problem. Just use those names.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyway, I went shopping for deodorant today again. Looking at me struggling, toying around with all black canisters, the store owner pulled all the options away, kept one in front of me and said, \"you will love this, sir, trust me\". That won't have done it, but then he added, \"you will click a picture of this and come again next time asking for this one\".</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once I returned home with that deodorant, I minutely stared at my reflection in the mirror, wondering what <a href=\"https://amitgawande.com/small-town-diaries-shopping/\">in the way I dressed</a> gave that store owner the feeling that I can't read English.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

It‚Äôs a short read, but it makes you pause and ponder over each idea. Just for Joy‚Äôs fascinating interpretation of the tale of a man‚Äôs fate and what that represents for a writer, I would bookmark this essay and reread it occasionally.</p><blockquote>A writer‚Äôs awareness must never be inadequate. Still, it will never be adequate to the greater awareness of the work itself, the work that the writer is trying to write. The writer must not really know what he is knowing, what he is learning to know when he writes, which is more than the knowing of it. A writer loves the dark, loves it, but is always fumbling around in the light. The writer is separate from his work but that‚Äôs all the writer is‚Äîwhat he writes. A writer must be smart but not too smart. He must be dumb enough to break himself to harness. He must be reckless and patient and daring and dull‚Äîfor what is duller than writing, trying to write?</blockquote><h3 id=\"thoughts-on-writing-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.elizabethgilbert.com/thoughts-on-writing/\">Thoughts on Writing</a> ‚Üí</h3><p>Each time I read this insightful post from Elizabeth Gilbert, I find a new advice that I had missed earlier. Every paragraph, every statement is a nice reminder for each writer, aspiring and established, to focus on what matters the most to keep writing. Elizabeth talks about how she herself got started writing, how every writer should handle rejections and yet should keep trying with unwavering desire to write more. <em>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the world‚Äôs fault that you want to be an artist‚Ä¶now get back to work‚Äù - </em>I‚Äôve framed this blunt, yet effective, suggestion from Elizabeth on the wall opposite to my writing desk.</p><blockquote>Insanity is a very tempting path for artists, but we don‚Äôt need any more of that in the world at the moment, so please resist your call to insanity. We need more creation, not more destruction. We need our artists more than ever, and we need them to be stable, steadfast, honorable and brave ‚Äì they are our soldiers, our hope. If you decide to write, then you must do it, as Balzac said, ‚Äúlike a miner buried under a fallen roof.‚Äù Become a knight, a force of diligence and faith. I don‚Äôt know how else to do it except that way.</blockquote><h3 id=\"the-ecstasy-of-influence-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://harpers.org/archive/2007/02/the-ecstasy-of-influence/\">The Ecstasy of Influence</a> ‚Üí</h3><p>Jonathan Lethem succinctly and pointedly talks about the thin line between inspiration and plagiarism in the varied art forms. With an observation, that ‚Äúliterature has always been a crucible in which familiar themes are continually recast‚Äù and backing it by abundant examples, Jonathan goes on to speculate if there exists such a line at all.</p><blockquote>Most artists are brought to their vocation when their own nascent gifts are awakened by the work of a master. That is to say, most artists are converted to art by art itself. Finding one‚Äôs voice isn‚Äôt just an emptying and purifying oneself of the words of others but an adopting and embracing of filiations, communities, and discourses. Inspiration could be called inhaling the memory of an act never experienced. Invention, it must be humbly admitted, does not consist in creating out of void but out of chaos. Any artist knows these truths, no matter how deeply he or she submerges that knowing.</blockquote><h2 id=\"postscript\">Postscript</h2><p>Have any recommendations or feedback for me?

I enjoy reading mystery as a genre the most - in that <em>whodunit</em> has a special place in my mind. It is the most difficult genre to write effectively.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This short read falls in the category that Agatha Christie had mastered -- the story unravels itself for both the reader and the central characters together. Everything is laid out in front of the reader with nothing being held back by the \"intelligent\" detective. I hate the I-knew-it-all-along sort of twists. The mysteries that don't employ such ploys can leave you with satisfaction that is of the highest order.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is not the underlying mystery that charmed me though. It is the sincere presentation of Jewish culture in a small-town community of Barnard's Crossing, notwithstanding the humorous undertone that author Harry Kemelman maintains throughout. I loved the setting of the lovable town and the characters big and small - I connected with each one of them. I enjoyed the discussions that David Small gets into every now and then, for that matter right from the get-go when he untangles the middling mystery of a broken vehicle with his simple, basic yet effective method of listening. I knew right away that I was in for an enjoyable ride.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is an intelligent book with a common, sincere central character. He is not the only intelligent being around - each supporting character is important and equally worthy. I loved Rabbi Small's bantering with Chief Lanigan on topics both related and unrelated to the mystery. The later, equally smart, is not there just to hear the detective unravel the mystery towards the end. He is involved too. In that manner, this book is special.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I haven't been this engaged while reading a book, or to find what happens next since a long time now.

White</blockquote><p>I never attested to the belief that language originated abruptly; or that the complex formation of a group of characters was planted into existence. It had to have evolved gradually, had to have become simpler, yet complicated at the same time as it got used broadly. As Ralph Waldo Emerson had aptly put it, ‚Äúlanguage is a city, to the building of which every human being brought a stone‚Äù. This is true not just for English, but for every other language in use today.</p><p>And yet, the exact origins of language as a notion are yet unknown.

There are of course attempts from linguists to explain how humans planned and worked this fascinating system out. Though Richard Nordquist from ThoughtCo. presents the theories from each of the viewpoints, the exact proofs, unlike <a href=\"https://www.getrevue.co/profile/amitgawande/issues/let-s-dwell-in-writing-history-258801?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">the origins of writing</a>, are yet to be found.</p><blockquote>Today, opinion on the matter of language origins is still deeply divided. On the one hand, there are those who feel that language is so complex, and so deeply ingrained in the human condition, that it must have evolved slowly over immense periods of time. Indeed, some believe that its roots go all the way back to <em>Homo habilis</em>, a tiny-brained hominid that lived in Africa not far short of two million years ago. On the other, there are those like [Robert] Berwick and [Noam] Chomsky who believe that humans acquired language quite recently, in an abrupt event. Nobody is in the middle on this one, except to the extent that different extinct hominid species are seen as the inaugurators of language‚Äôs slow evolutionary trajectory.</blockquote><h3 id=\"who-decides-what-words-mean-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/why-language-might-be-the-optimal-self-regulating-system?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">Who decides what words mean</a> ‚Üí</h3><p>As fascinating as the history of the language is, the concept itself is no less bewildering.

It‚Äôs unfathomable how we humans communicate with one another, and yet unfathom the innate complexities of this self-regulating system.</p><blockquote>Language is a <em>system</em>. Sounds, words and grammar do not exist in isolation: each of these three levels of language constitutes a system in itself. And, extraordinarily, these systems change as systems. If one change threatens disruption, another change compensates, so that the new system, though different from the old, is still an efficient, expressive and useful whole.</blockquote><blockquote>Begin with sounds. Every language has a characteristic inventory of contrasting sounds, called phonemes. <em>Beet</em> and <em>bit</em> have different vowels; these are two phonemes in English. Italian has only one, which is why Italians tend to make homophones of <em>sheet</em> and <em>shit</em>.</blockquote><h3 id=\"the-worlds-most-efficient-languages-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/06/complex-languages/489389/?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">The World's Most Efficient Languages</a> ‚Üí</h3><p>As English became the widely accepted official language of the nations across the world, the inefficiencies of this ‚Äúglobal‚Äù language came to the fore. The more it adapted and relaxed the rules of the usage and the semantics, it risked losing the chance to become native for any community. ‚ÄúJust as fish presumably don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre wet, many English speakers don‚Äôt know that the way their language works is just one of endless ways it could have come out‚Äù. That‚Äôs how this wonderful essay at The Atlantic begins as it contrasts English‚Äôs efficiency, or the lack thereof, against a few native languages.</p><blockquote>Languages are strikingly different in the level of detail they require a speaker to provide in order to put a sentence together. In English, for example, here‚Äôs a simple sentence that comes to my mind for rather specific reasons related to having small children: ‚ÄúThe father said ‚ÄòCome here!‚Äô‚Äù This statement specifies that there is a father, that he conducted the action of speaking in the past, and that he indicated the child should approach him at the location ‚Äúhere.‚Äù What else would a language need to do? Well, for a German speaker, more.

It is a brilliant read for when the trying times drag you, your morale down. Everyone fails. Especially those who are known for their successes. I find the below passage from Anne Enright enlightening.</p><blockquote>I have no problem with failure - it is success that makes me sad. Failure is easy. I do it every day, I have been doing it for years. I have thrown out more sentences than I ever kept, I have dumped months of work, I have wasted whole years writing the wrong things for the wrong people. Even when I am pointed the right way and productive and finally published, I am not satisfied by the results. This is not an affectation, failure is what writers do. It is built in.</blockquote><h3 id=\"fail-better-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070503180159/http://faculty.sunydutchess.edu/oneill/failbetter.htm\">Fail better</a> ‚Üí</h3><p>‚ÄúWhat makes a good writer? Is writing an expression of self, or, as TS Eliot argued, ‚Äòan escape from personality‚Äô? Do novelists have a duty? Do readers? Why are there so few truly great novels? Zadie Smith writes about literature‚Äôs legacy of honourable failure.‚Äù</p><blockquote>Map of disappointments - Nabokov would call that a good title for a bad novel. It strikes me as a suitable guide to the land where writers live, a country I imagine as mostly beach, with hopeful writers standing on the shoreline while their perfect novels pile up, over on the opposite coast, out of reach. Thrusting out of the shoreline are hundreds of piers, or ‚Äúdisappointed bridges‚Äù, as Joyce called them. Most writers, most of the time, get wet. Why they get wet is of little interest to critics or readers, who can only judge the soggy novel in front of them. But for the people who write novels, what it takes to walk the pier and get to the other side is, to say the least, a matter of some importance.</blockquote><h3 id=\"write-till-you-drop-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/03/28/specials/dillard-drop.html\">Write Till You Drop</a> ‚Üí</h3><p>For a writer, every rejection, every failure is an opportunity to stop writing? <em>Why should I write when no one wants to read what I write? And what should I write about if anything that I write about doesn‚Äôt interest anyone? </em>The doubts are genuine, but to stop after such doubts cloud your mind is to be brutal on the creative mind. Annie Dillard lays out many ways that writers can trudge along through the difficult phases of self-scrutiny.</p><blockquote>One of the few things I know about writing is this: spend it all, shoot it, play it, lose it, all, right away, every time. Do not hoard what seems good for a later place in the book, or for another book; give it, give it all, give it now. The impulse to save something good for a better place later is the signal to spend it now. Something more will arise for later, something better.

Books are no more threatened by Kindle than stairs by elevators.‚Äù ‚Äì Stephen Fry</blockquote><p><em>People who love books and reading cannot love eBooks, </em>goes the adage. Penelope Lively calls them ‚Äúsome sort of bloodless nerd‚Äù. So much has been written and published by the authors and the public in general on their love for the specific forms of the books. Some people have had contrasting thoughts; talking about eBooks, Douglas Adams had famously said that one should ‚Äúnot confuse the plate for the food‚Äù. But he had also quipped that ‚Äúwe notice e-book readers, we don‚Äôt notice books‚Äù.</p><p>So, what is it, then? This issue features a few well-written essays that talk about the partisan debates around the different forms of the books, starting with their evolution over the years. I want to remain unbiased; I will try to be that. After all, I am just the guy serving the plates; it‚Äôs the food on those plates that matters.</p><hr><h2 id=\"featured-writing\">Featured Writing</h2><h3 id=\"the-evolution-of-the-book-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://sfbook.com/the-evolution-of-the-book.htm\">The Evolution of the book</a> ‚Üí</h3><p>With a fascinating look at how books have evolved over the years from ‚Äúthe clay tablets to the e-book format,‚Äù SFBook Review presents a snapshot of the publishing history. ‚ÄúAs books have now reached the 21st century with the creation of the increasingly popular e-book, we thought it would be a good idea to take a look back at the long and involved history of the humble book.‚Äù Here‚Äôs a snippet on the birth of the ‚Äúcheap‚Äù novel.</p><blockquote>With the continued spread of the written word, along with a growth in education and the continued reduction in print costs, the first mass-market paperbacks were born. In Britain there were two distinct markets these mass publications were aimed at, the juvenile market with the ‚Äústory papers‚Äù and the working class adult which were known as a ‚Äúpenny dreadful‚Äù, ‚Äúpenny number‚Äù or a ‚Äúpenny blood‚Äù - due to the fact that they each cost a ‚Äúpenny‚Äù. Eventually these novels were exclusively aimed at the working class youth market and the term story paper became interchangeable with penny dreadful.</blockquote><p>Equally insightful is the <a href=\"https://www.voices.com/blog/_evolution_of_audiobooks_continued/\">evolution of audiobooks</a>. Did you know that the first audiobook was recorded in 1952?</p><h3 id=\"ebooks-v-paper-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53d3096a-f792-11e3-90fa-00144feabdc0\">Ebooks v paper</a> ‚Üí</h3><p>Undoubtedly, the individual preference of a form of the book matters the most. Nonetheless, the heartily debated topic, a cultural divide of sorts, is researched equally well, forcing us to rethink how we respond to the written word. Which form does our brains prefer? Financial Times has a detailed write-down of the physical effects of the increased screen times or connectivity associated with the eBooks; at the same time, it also presents more emotional or the psychological aspects associated with the inherent differences of the media forms.</p><blockquote>As researchers examine the differences reading in different media make, they are also having to distinguish carefully between the different things that we do when we read. Take, for instance, the difference between ‚Äúdeep reading‚Äù, when you really get immersed in a text, and ‚Äúactive learning‚Äù, when you make notes in margins or put down the book to cross-reference with something else.</blockquote><h3 id=\"listening-to-books-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/listening-to-books/?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">Listening to Books</a> ‚Üí</h3><p>In this love letter to audiobooks, Maggie Gram confesses her love, her liking for audiobooks and attempts to address the criticisms that this format of the books receives. Is reading the only <em>true</em> form of reading? Or ‚Äúreading is only reading when it requires the constant assertion of will,‚Äù as many critics of the medium might say. ¬†That‚Äôs the question, the disapproval that Maggie attempts to answer in this heartfelt essay. </p><blockquote>Less dude-like people, people less invested in making fun of you, will just cock their heads to the side and ask you why you do it. As if liking books were not enough! As if it weren‚Äôt the best thing in the world to have someone read to you! <em>As if you had something better to do!</em> I thought about starting this essay by insisting that I listen to audio books <em>for work</em>, so that I could not be mistaken for that other kind of person, that kind of person who listens audio books because it brings her some kind of unsophisticated pleasure. I am not, I wanted you to know, your Aunt Paula. My kitchen is not decorated with rooster towel racks and rooster potholders and rooster trim. I am a <em>very serious person</em>.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eTFy8RnUkoU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><h2 id=\"featured-writerolivia-parkes\">Featured Writer - <a href=\"http://www.oliviaparkes.com/?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">Olivia Parkes</a></h2><p>As I read through the collection of short stories from Olivia Parkes, I knew what a brilliant writer she is.

With some brilliant analogies and flirty humour, she brings a smile to your face; makes you pause and read the passage again at various points. I couldn‚Äôt word the recommendation better than the Halimah Marcus. ‚ÄúRead this story to find out what the breakdown of social order in a marriage looks like. Read this story to find out whether the cat lives or dies.

I have rarely used that adjective for a documentary. But this one is so very different. I cannot fathom someone's possession for their passion can blind them to the risks rather conspicuous to the rest. I was aware of the free soloing as a form of climbing. What took me by surprise was the level of planning that goes into the preparation.

The single-take narration grips one right from the beginning and never lets off even for a moment. I was with the characters throughout their journey, feeling their anxiety, their pain. I entered every new terrain, turned every dark corner equally uneasy. What Mendes and his cinematographer Roger Deakins manage to achieve is absolute brilliance. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and was left gasping by the end. A cinematic masterpiece.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Greyhound</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another war flick that, sure, aimed to be different. A fast-paced action thriller about battleships is not very common. However, the economical 75 minutes of the runtime itself felt too long. The fights felt repetitive and with no other thread to hold the plot together, it was easy to skip over. Tom Hanks sells the character though. However, I am tired now of seeing him play the perfect guy.

One of the aspects that I'd identified was that I was always judging myself, was always thinking, analyzing my current actions for their effect on my future. I'd decided <a href=\"http://amitgawande.com/slow-down-be-present/\">to stop doing that</a>. But while I wrote that, I hadn't realized that there is deeper malady there -- my subconscious quest to be a perfectionist. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I was reading an essay <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-dangerous-downsides-of-perfectionism\" target=\"_blank\">about the downsides of perfectionism </a>from Amanda Ruggeri at BBC, it made me aware that I've also been affected by the same trait she was warning about. I want things to be done perfectly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At home. At work. With the activities that I do on my own. With my family. With my peers, my superiors.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is that perfectionist voice within me that's constantly judging me, judging others.

Why do I do that? It can't be healthy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even on Google, the first autocomplete suggestion for \"Perfectionism\" is \"Perfectionism is a disease\". I wouldn't term this trait as that -- I don't want to flippantly use a word while representing any form of mental disorder -- it ain't a \"disease\" for sure. However, even an offhand read through the internet would convince you that perfectionism can lead to a laundry list of such disorders. Anxiety. Depression. And much more.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I am not sure if my habit of aiming for perfection in every task is affecting my mood and my mind in any alarming way yet. However, I think it does lead me to procrastinate at times. <em>I don't have time now, will do it later \"perfectly,\"</em> I can hear my mind say every now and then.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, it's believed and acknowledged to be a vicious cycle - perfectionism, procrastination and paralysis. Or thought another way, it is the paralysis by analysis. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis\" target=\"_blank\">Analysis paralysis</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All this lead me to <a href=\"https://amitgawande.com/stop-overthinking/\">a post I wrote back in 2013</a>, on exactly the same topic of over-analyzing, overthinking. And it was then that I had linked to this term of Analysis paralysis for the first time. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That was 7 years ago. I believe I haven't managed to get rid of my trait yet. It might be time to think about getting rid of this habit.

Or catching up on my read later lists. Or writing. Or working on the short story in progress. Nothing. I spent the whole two days lying on my sofa, enjoying a movie marathon with my family.

More than being an essay about a brief on punctuation, it details the history of punctuation, its relevance before and after the introduction of printing, and the recent trends in the use of punctuation. Dr. Nordquist has it all covered.</p><blockquote>The beginnings of punctuation lie in classical rhetoric‚Äîthe art of oratory. Back in ancient Greece and Rome, when a speech was prepared in writing, marks were used to indicate where‚Äîand for how long ‚Äî a speaker should pause. Until the 18th century, punctuation was primarily related to spoken delivery (elocution), and the marks were interpreted as pauses that could be counted out.</blockquote><h3 id=\"the-comma-from-which-my-heart-hangs-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/the-comma-from-which-my-heart-hangs\">The Comma From Which My Heart Hangs</a> ‚Üí</h3><p>Benjamin Samuel at McSweeney‚Äôs Internet Tendency describes the great power comma possesses in our writing. Backing his argument with some pertinent examples, he delivers his point with an abundance of wit and tinge of humor that is a signature of every article at McSweeney‚Äôs.</p><blockquote>If nothing else, one ought to know how to treat a comma. Abandonment or abuse of the comma muddles discourse, and this lack of respect is akin to neglect, to a lack of appreciation, to an unreasonable rejection of the very foundation of all worthy human interactions. (‚Ä¶) It simply cannot be said too often that punctuation, not just the noble comma, is crucial to communication and comprehension. Truly, a poorly constructed sentence can set worlds crumbling, can alter perceptions irreparably.</blockquote><h3 id=\"tips-on-grammar-punctuation-and-style-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/tips-grammar-punctuation-and-style\">Tips on Grammar, Punctuation and Style</a> ‚Üí</h3><p>‚ÄúIf the rules you learned about commas and semi-colons don‚Äôt mean much to you, forget them and try this.‚Äù That is how Kim Cooper begins this helpful guide on punctuation published for Writing Center at Harvard University. This is a handy list of suggestions on how one can check the selection of punctuation like commas and semi-colons, dashes and hyphens as part of her writing.</p><blockquote>If you don‚Äôt want your reader to pause, there shouldn‚Äôt be a comma, there, because as, this demonstrates it‚Äôs very difficult to figure, out, what you‚Äôre saying when your punctuation, makes the sentence unreadable. Your sentences shouldn‚Äôt leave your reader hyperventilating from the constant shallow breaths that over-punctuation requires. Nor should they be gasping for breath at the end of a long, unpunctuated sentence. (Consider yourself responsible for your readers‚Äô cardiovascular health.)</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OV5J6BfToSw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><hr><h2 id=\"featured-writercaleb-tankersley\">Featured Writer - <a href=\"https://calebtankersley.com/\">Caleb Tankersley</a></h2><p>Caleb published a short dark story ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.carvezine.com/story/summer-2020-tankersley\">Swarm Creatures</a>‚Äù as part of Carve magazine‚Äôs Summer 2020 edition.

When perceptions of your physical power become an albatross around your neck, and when the default compliment is not about your abilities, but rather your appearance.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"featured-toolhemingway-editor\">Featured Tool - <a href=\"http://www.hemingwayapp.com/?utm_campaign=Slanting%20Nib%20%26%20A%20Keyboard&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">Hemingway Editor</a></h2><p>A short, simple app that intends to be ‚Äúa spellchecker, but for style‚Äù.

He was convinced it was a sound he had heard before, a rattle of sorts on a wooden top. He got out of his bedroom; he was certain now that the sound was coming from downstairs. He tried to calm his mind, suspecting it was his loneliness that was playing games.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Raghav stepped onto the first stair and the sound stopped with the first creak of the wooden stairs below his feet. The lack of sound now made him even more nervous. Did he make someone or <em>something </em>aware of his presence? Why did the sound stop? The lack of persistent hum was making his legs shake. He stood frozen on the stairs peering into the darkness beneath. It was lifeless, as it should be. But even the normal made Raghav quiver. He felt that the narrow staircase was closing in on him on both sides, becoming narrower with each second that he stood there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"<em>I cannot stand witless here anymore,</em>\" he thought.

He was sure now that his mind wasn‚Äôt playing any games with him; there was something rattling on the dining table in the kitchen. He took a deep breath and ran down the staircase. He stood at the entrance of the kitchen and peeked inside. It was pitch dark inside, except for the dancing light from a buzzing mobile phone on the dining table. Raghav was relieved it wasn‚Äôt an unexplainable sound. But the relief was only short-lived as the realization that the phone wasn‚Äôt his soon hit him.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He ambled slowly towards the shuddering device; the screen visibly showed that there was an incoming call. Before he could see whom the call was from, the phone stopped ringing and fright struck him as the room went dark around him. He scuttled across the floor to the dining table, picked up the phone, and brought the screen back to life. He heaved a sigh as the faint light illuminated his surroundings. He hadn‚Äôt even exhaled the full sigh yet before the phone in his hand started to vibrate again. He slowly turned the now-brightened screen to face him; his face went white. The screen read <em>Incoming call . . . Raghav iPhone</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I just don't need it.</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have been using HEY for almost two weeks now and since last few days, I have hardly acted on any emails the way the team wants me to. Most emails have been filtered out. Tells me an email as a communication medium is already pretty worthless for me.  I can't pay so much for something that's worth so little. Here's my state from yesterday as I <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://micro.blog/amit/9882520\" target=\"_blank\">responded to</a> an ongoing conversation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>HEY makes my email even more worthless than it already is for me. I hardly see any emails getting filtered through to me. I'm yet to decide if it's a good thing or a bad one.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have always been a user of the <em>free</em> Gmail service until now. I have evaluated many email services over the years, but haven't paid for any. I do not run my livelihood over my personal email. Neither do I receive so many emails that managing them becomes a hassle of any sort. I could just sit down for a few minutes and handle all of them together. I hardly have to triage them -- snooze or reply later are all nice features. But I rarely need them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If all the other emails services failed to pique any interest in me earlier, why did HEY even come so close? Well, because I do see how all the features they tout as game-changing can actually solve the problems many people face with their email. No wonder then that even I want to use all the features. But my current lifestyle just doesn't have any need for any of those.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>But the screening and the feed and the paper trail?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, I spent the last couple of hours on Gmail to clean my filters -- and with that, I have now got a pretty similar workflow in place with the help of filters and customized priority inbox. Here's how my inbox looks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":6089,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/uploads/2020/f404136a66.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6089\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Will I be able to maintain it? No idea. I have managed to sail through for so long. I had no clue about the sheer amount of emails even my current system was already \"screening\" out. So, I believe I would be fine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Won't I love if a system did that for me? Well, sure I would love that. But you see Hey <em>doesn't</em> want to be that system. Here's <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://hey.com/the-hey-way/\" target=\"_blank\">an excerpt from their manifesto</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Email‚Äôs better with a human at the helm. That‚Äôs you. You‚Äôre better at deciding where things go, what your intentions are, and how you want things set up. The machines have a lot of learning to do before they'll be able to second-guess whether you actually wanted to see that email, whether it was a receipt or a newsletter, and even what you should be writing someone. At HEY, it's human intelligence over artificial intelligence.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The whole workflow in HEY begins with me screening the first time senders before they arrive at my inbox. Well, nice. However, am ok to take the same decision after it has reached my inbox -- I will create a filter. That's ugly, manual work sure. But <em>it doesn't cost me $99/year worth of my time</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have already created labels for feeds and paper trail. And many more. Because you see, my emails don't just fit in these two categories. I have a lot many more filters. And I have pretty simple rules for each.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>I need this mail in my inbox, unread.</li><li>I need this to skip my inbox, but stay unread. I will get to it.</li><li>I need this to skip my inbox and get marked as read.</li><li>I need this to be deleted.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's it. All my filters do just this. I will continue to do so manually. (I do wish though that the Gmail's Android app allowed creating simple filters in their app.)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>And am ok to lose the email address I want?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, I've currently shared my Gmail address everywhere. Even if I shift to HEY, I have to change the email address registered with many of the services. I think if I am ever to go through all this trouble, it would be for one with my custom domain. In which case, it won't matter what email address I get <em>on the service</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All in all, HEY is a brilliant service with a fresh perspective towards the way we use our emails. It can potentially enliven the email offerings from all the players, just the away Gmail did back in 2004. But I don't face the problem it is trying to solve; I have no use for all its groundbreaking features. So, I can in no way justify paying the price it asks for it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

First published: summer 1946. A fascinating look at Orwell‚Äôs early life and what made him the writer that he eventually became.</p><blockquote>It is his [<em>a writer‚Äôs</em>] job, no doubt, to discipline his temperament and avoid getting stuck at some immature stage, in some perverse mood; but if he escapes from his early influences altogether, he will have killed his impulse to write. Putting aside the need to earn a living, I think there are four great motives for writing, at any rate for writing prose.</blockquote><blockquote>All writers are vain, selfish, and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery. Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. And yet it is also true that one can write nothing readable unless one constantly struggles to efface one‚Äôs own personality.

I‚Äôve read pages and pages with interest and empathy, with boredom and more than a little shame. But having traversed that stack of lives, what remains more than anything, tingling like a phantom limb, is a sensation of stillness: the journal as the eye of the writing life‚Äôs storm.</blockquote><blockquote>‚ÄúIn the journal,‚Äù Susan Sontag wrote, ‚ÄúI do not just express myself more openly than I could to any person; I create myself.‚Äù</blockquote><h3 id=\"my-lifes-sentencesby-jhumpa-lahiri-%E2%86%92\"><a href=\"https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/my-lifes-sentences/\">My Life's Sentences - by Jhumpa Lahiri</a> ‚Üí</h3><p>Jhumpa Lahiri recounts her relationship with her sentences. A fine way to look at how a story or a novel, what she refers to as forest, is conceived - ‚Äúone in front of the other‚Äù.</p><blockquote>Constructing a sentence is the equivalent of taking a Polaroid snapshot: pressing the button, and watching something emerge. To write one is to document and to develop at the same time. Sentences are the bricks as well as the mortar, the motor as well as the fuel. They are the cells, the individual stitches. Their nature is at once solitary and social.</blockquote><blockquote>Even printed, on pages that are bound, sentences remain unsettled organisms. Years later, I can always reach out to smooth a stray hair. And yet, at a certain point, I must walk away, trusting them to do their work. I am left looking over my shoulder, wondering if I might have structured one more effectively.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oP3c1h8v2ZQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><hr><h2 id=\"featured-writercheri-baker\">Featured Writer - <a href=\"https://cheribaker.com/\">Cheri Baker</a></h2><p>Cheri is an author with a brilliant mind.

It made us forget about all the terrible news that was spread through the world outside‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâmakes it a very special movie for me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>8. Monsters Inc. (2001)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Again, another of the early movies from Pixar. I wasn‚Äôt a parent then, but it made me aware for the first time what parenting would be. As I watched Sulley and Mike struggle to keep Boo safe, at the same time growing closer to her, it made me worried and equally excited for the parent that I was one day going to be. I fell in love with Boo as she expressed myriad of expressions through her toddler face.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>7. Inside Out (2015)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This has to be one of the smartest and most creative animated movies ever made. Such a creative story stitched into a brilliant movie. The colours, the characters, their journeys alone and together. How they drove the central human character was fascinating. This was again a movie that made me realize what I need not do around my daughter as she reaches adolescence one day. The story was clever, the execution was top-notch and the emotional attachment was to the point.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>6. Wall-E (2008)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another clever movie from Pixar. The first half without any spoken words was absolutely brilliant. I still can‚Äôt fathom how the studio made us fall in love with a squarish droid. He doesn‚Äôt speak, he doesn‚Äôt have any human features. But he expressed so many emotions that many of the well-paid actors fail to do. Wall-E‚Äôs struggle to express his love for Eve had me root for this lovely droid throughout the movie. Wish humans didn‚Äôt arrive later in the movie to spoil what could have been the finest movie of all times.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><b>5. Toy Story (1995)</b></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another movie that I watched way back in my teens when I had started to believe I had become too grown up to watch animated movies any more. Pixar prove me wrong‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâboy what a masterpiece this one is. A movie with a brilliant story that also teaches you so much. Still being so much fun at the same time. Toy Story completely defined the roadmap for future animated films‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthey had to cater to the kids and the adults with a kid within at the same time. This movie did it so perfectly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><b>4. Coco (2017)</b></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I love music. And I love getting emotional while watching a movie. Especially if it weaves stories around families. So Coco fit just the right spots for me. Boy, oh boy. Such a wonderful ride it was. Those mesmerizing colours. The peppy, moving music. The story that has you gripped throughout. Coco was an experience of a kind. Again, such a meaningful movie that teaches you the importance of a family. I had a tear rolling down my cheek during the final reunion song.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><b>3. Finding Nemo (2003)</b></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another film that touched my yet-to-be-a-parent‚Äôs heart. I was rooting for the worried, clown-fish dad throughout his transformation. And I can‚Äôt recall how many more times have I rooted for this guy since then. I watch this movie every now and then with my daughter. She loves it; she asks me many questions about what plays out in the movie. I pull her close to me into a hug and answer her to the best of my abilities. Knowing very well, that soon she too would want to explore more and I would have to stop being overprotective and let her do that. Anyway, see that‚Äôs what even thinking about this movie does to me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>2. Toy Story 3 (2010)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There‚Äôs just so much to love about this movie. The friendship, the bond that we‚Äôve seen grow over the 3 movies, comes so close to a culmination here. Full of laughter. Full of life-lessons. Full of heartbreaks. This is one hell of a movie - not just an animated one. Period. As Woody looks at Andy walking away while sitting close to Bonny towards the end, am sobbing away with joy. There are so many plots here and each one betters the last. This one is a string of masterclass at film making, one after another.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>1. Up (2009)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just with that masterful opening montage, this one enters my top ten list any day. I had a lump in my throat right at the beginning. The movie follows it up with weaving such a beautiful story about Carl and his relation with Russel and the many friends he makes over their journey to Paradise Falls. I loved each character in this movie. Russel. Kevin. Dug. Even Muntz for that matter. The movie had me empathize with this antagonist too before he goes all bat-shit crazy, that is. And of course, finally Carl. I loved Carl so much that I had one character based on him in my fictional short story series. Up will always remain a very special movie for me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Best Moments from other movies</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are of course many other movies from Pixar that didn‚Äôt make the list but have some brilliant scenes. When She Loved Me song from <b>Toy Story 2</b>. All the action sequence from <b>The Incredibles</b>. Speech on criticism and creativity in the finale from <b>Ratatouille</b>. These movies could very well have made the list, just for these scenes. But, for me, the others on the list are just very close. So these remain the honourable mentions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

The resolution towards the end too did not feel very natural; it felt rushed, forced.</p> <p>With the way the novel is structured, it felt as if Christie began writing this somewhere in the middle when Poirot is introduced, reached towards the end, and began to wonder how to tie the woven mystery up. All the side characters and their backstories were penned at that point and spread across the novel.</p> <p>As a whole, the story just didn&#x2019;t feel coherent. It wasn&#x2019;t boring; I don&#x2019;t think Christie can write a boring mystery. But it just wasn&#x2019;t one of her finest works. I have heard even she has acknowledged this fact.</p>\n",

I was left completely clueless on how to respond to that.</p> <p>My daughter&#x2019;s school has enabled schooling of 5 subjects via an app. Each week, the app presents a new set of chapters, worksheets, quizzes across all 5 subjects. Besides, each week there are video conference sessions with teachers to recap what was learned in the last week.</p> <p>Sorry to report, but just two weeks in, this process already seems overwhelming. It is especially so given both me and my wife are working from home.</p> <p>I knew we weren&#x2019;t alone. <span class=\"small-caps\">AP</span> <a href=\"https://apnews.com/a3e86445d1387ecd8d1df8f9f7743e1f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">published a brilliant article</a> on how parents in the <span class=\"small-caps\">US</span> are already getting burned through this distance learning&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;something that is especially tricky with young kids. And they are forced to make a very difficult choice.</p> <blockquote> <p>Amid the barrage of learning apps, video meet-ups and e-mailed assignments that pass as pandemic home school, some frustrated and exhausted parents are choosing to disconnect entirely for the rest of the academic year. Others are cramming all their children&#x2019;s school work into the weekend or taking days off work to help their kids with a week&#x2019;s worth of assignments in one day.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is just not easy. Parents aren&#x2019;t trained to be good teachers. The technology was never given a chance to prove it can work independently for teaching. It was always an additive. Plus nothing, <em>nothing</em> can replace the in-person learning from the people who are trained throughout their lives to do that. The comment below from one of the parents is very, very apt.</p> <blockquote> <p>This is a very crude bandage we&#x2019;re putting on a very big wound. We&#x2019;re just doing the best we can. A video can&#x2019;t look at your child&#x2019;s face and see the confusion. A teacher can do that.</p> </blockquote>\n",

It presented a list of questions that one should lead with while talking to others<strong>. </strong></p> <p>I thought I will try and attempt to answer a few of these myself. Maybe you can give it a try too. And if you do, I would like to read how you are dealing with this challenging moment. Here&#x2019;s my attempt.</p> <note> <strong>How are you taking care of yourself today?</strong> </note> <p>Listening to music&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;spending some time with <em>myself</em>. It&#x2019;s been some time that I did that. I used to do that very often. Of course, it was a lot easier to find some lone time. Not that easy any more.</p> <note> <strong>What part of your shelter-in-place residence have you come to appreciate the most?</strong> </note> <p>The corner with my study table, I am happy that I spent some significant time designing it while I was renovating my home. And another room I like to go relax in now and then is the bathroom.</p> <note> <strong>What surprising thing have you been stocking up on (that isn&#x2019;t toilet paper)?</strong> </note> <p>Body lotion&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;I do not know why, but I have got many of them now. And biscuits. I never knew I liked biscuits so much.</p> <note> <strong>What&#x2019;s a story&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;from a book, a movie, an article, a conversation&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;that you&#x2019;ve been gripped by recently? Why did it capture you?</strong> </note> <p>All the stories of sacrifices that get published every single day&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;when the humans have behaved just the way they should. It has been rare to read about recently.</p> <note> <strong>What habit have you started, or broken, during the quarantine?</strong> </note> <p>I have fallen out of the habit of writing the morning pages. I know I shouldn&#x2019;t have. But for some reason, there isn&#x2019;t much that&#x2019;s different that every new day dawns with.</p> <p>I have fallen into my old habit of listening to the music&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;lots of varied music.</p> <p>I am not listening to podcasts. Or Audiobooks. I am <em>reading</em> lots of books.</p> <note> <strong>Which specific place in your neighborhood are you most looking forward to visiting once this is all over?</strong> </note> <p>Every part of the neighborhood. Everything that&#x2019;s outside. That&#x2019;s crowded. The streets. The restaurants.</p> <note> <strong>What&#x2019;s the easiest part about the quarantine?</strong> </note> <p>Finding stuff to idle the time away with.</p> <note> <strong>What are some things you have realized that you don&#x2019;t really need?</strong> </note> <p>Air conditioners. Cash.</p> <note> <strong>What&#x2019;s something you own that feels useful?</strong> </note> <p>Internet. Kindle. Plants and Garden.</p> <note> <strong>What is your COVID-19 nickname/alter-ego?</strong> </note> <p>The chatty, social one. I have been part of many zoom meetings, few even those where I knew no one on the other side.</p> <note> <strong>What problem&#x2014;either yours, or something more global &#x2014;do you wish you could solve?</strong> </note> <p>Illiteracy. Stupidity. Rebelism.</p>\n",

A half an hour walk across the rooms. And balconies. At home. Work, as the mind wanders every now and then. At home. Play board games, silly pranks with my daughter. Dance. Be foolish.

I am getting used to it.</p> <p>I spent the evening today with my daughter, looking out to the clear skies. She asked me nonchalantly why can&#x2019;t we go outside. And before I could answer, I saw her roll her eyes and blurt without a hint of sadness in her voice,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span><em>yeah, the virus&#x201D;</em>.</p> <p>She wished it will go settle onto the hilly forests that are visible from our balcony. She wished us, <em>just our family</em>, got fairy wings. So that we could make the clear, empty skies our home. The purity, the genuineness in her wishes, her thoughts brought a smile to my face.</p> <p>I know it is this zeal in her that will help me pull through this exhausting time. This new normal is fine with me.</p>\n",

The idea started simple - what if there was a simple posting interface for <a href=\"https://blot.im/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blot</a>? In extension, something that one can use to write and publish a post to Dropbox. Blot is simple as-is for writing and posting (<em>it&#x2019;s all files</em>). But there are times when I do want to quickly post from my web browser. And for such times, I still need a simple writing interface.</p> <p>That thought was enough to interest both me and David. We got to work. The project got neglected in between. And then was picked up again. And I think, it is in a state now where it can really be useful to a few. I can attest to that because I, myself, have been using it for <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/1585247849573\">few days now</a>.</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://wall.blot.im/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wall</a>&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;a<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>web-accessible text-editor over Dropbox, <em>works nicely with Blot</em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span>.</p> <p>I believe this would be useful for many. It is <em>clean</em>. It is <em>light, pure-client side</em> application. It supports <strong>local drafts</strong>. It can <strong>export markdown</strong>. It can <strong>publish to Blot</strong>. Perfect for all those text posts.</p> <p>I have <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/scribe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my own fork</a> of the project where I want to use the editor and support publishing to multiple places. To start with, I have extended it to post it anywhere in Dropbox.</p> <p>I have hosted it <a href=\"https://scribe.itchs.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here as Scribe</a>. I plan to extend it next to be used as a micropub client. Still in works, though.</p> <p>Of course, this is not perfect yet. For one, it does not work well on smaller screens.

Social distancing enforced by the ways the Coronavirus spreads has affected us a lot deeper than what we initially thought.</p> <blockquote> <p>How much the virus has reminded us of the mundane pleasures we take for granted &#x2014; walking down the well-stocked shelves of our local supermarkets, chatting idly with our co-workers; kissing a friend on the cheek when we meet for lunch. Oh, to hug again without having to calculate the inherent risk: My mother? My daughters?<br /> <br /> When I venture out to walk the dog, there is a grim camaraderie with those we encounter. The dogs, heedless of contagion, sniff away, and while their humans maintain a sober distance, even strangers inquire after one another&#x2019;s well-being. In the barren aisles of the market, at least the last time I risked a visit, there was an air more of solidarity than panic</p> </blockquote> <p>So true. What we thought was normal is dreaded now. And it the normalcy that we yearn for now. Together as a society.</p>\n",

There are already reports of how this is affecting families all around the world. I am afraid the chances are people will soon get fed-up, get impatient. They might stop caring about others, become isolated within. Become indifferent.</p> <p>Of course, another possibility is that this will bring immediate families even closer. I can do all that I do in a group while I am at home with family. I can decide not to isolate myself at home. I get focused hours for work and at the same time decide not to stay glued to the laptop throughout the day while working. Take the breaks that I usually take and spend that time with my family.</p> <p>There is no need to wind the working day down with media consumption as I can relieve stress throughout the day when required. Look beyond the mobile, tablet and television screens. I can spend the hours I generally wasted on commutes on something productive.</p> <p>Share stories. Hear from loved ones. Play with my daughter. Talk, chat, discuss, debate, tease. Laugh. Do everything I do at the office. And more.</p> <p>I think I will give this possibility a chance. Distance, not isolate. May be, social distancing, physically distancing myself from the outside world, will bring me emotionally closer to my family.</p>\n",

All the posts exist on the home page of the root domain now and is hosted by Blot. There are no sub-domains for separate posts. There is no landing page. It‚Äôs all words.</p> <p>Of course, I had butterflies in my stomach before I began the whole exercise. I had posts spread across different categories. I had very specific styling done for some rarely used components of the blog posts. And I had pages.</p> <p>Then I had some complex pages and posts. It was the thought of migrating this varied content that made me a bit edgy. Posts like this guide on <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/moving-from-squarespace-to-hugo\">moving to Hugo</a>. Or this one about <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/display-webmentions/\">displaying webmentions</a> along with posts. I had to manually migrate such posts along with the necessary styles.</p> <p>I am happy overall with what I have achieved. Things are simpler now. If I have to post something, I know where it would be. Doesn‚Äôt matter what the nature of the post is. This space now supports all types. Along with the <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/now\"><code>/now</code></a> page reseted to begin from <em>now</em>.</p> <p>What this also means that I have to bear with few things. I have lost webmentions to the <code>blog</code> sub-domain posts. I have to reset my indieweb presence, clear all caches with indieauth sites. Thankfully, not much was broken that couldn‚Äôt be fixed simple re-logins and re-configurations. I (and <em>you</em>) have to bear with the configured redirects to propagate through the Internet and reach all. So the old links will stay unreachable till that happens.</p> <p>I have kept the Hugo site alive. It hosts <a href=\"https://archive.amitgawande.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the archive</a>, something I did not want to carry along. I just restyled it to make it resemble a timeline leading back into the time. I do not wish to ever post to it again.

I enjoyed this book, almost most of it. However it is, by no means, a great book.</p> <p>The story is too formulaic. The mystery is predictable. Most of the characters are not built well. Every plot<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>twist&#x201D; can be seen chapters ahead. Even the narration is too simplistic. It is linear with the problems introduced in a chapter and solved right in the next one. There is simply no tension.</p> <p>However, the overall book is a breezy read. No part gets boring. I especially liked the parts where it was just about Scott and Maggie, the German Shepherd. I usually do not enjoy the subplots involving pets. They are overdone most often, made too dramatic. That&#x2019;s not the case here. The bonding between them is developed really well. You care for both. And that&#x2019;s where lies the strength of the novel. I just wish it was backed by a nice crime mystery.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>The decade gone by - 2010-2019 - was the most important decade of my life.</p> <p>This was the first full decade that I lived an <em>independent</em> life away from my parents - shaping my own life in a way. My personal life. And my professional life. I spent the decade before this one completing my education, setting things up for my life to come. But it was in this decade when I started recognizing myself. Defining myself.</p> <p>I got settled into my first job. I fell in love and then married her. We moved in into a house and made it our home. We learned to live together. We purchased our first car. We decided to settle in and shifted to a new town to do just that. We found a house where we felt we could start our independent life together and purchased it.</p> <p>We decided the time was right to welcome another member to our family. We were blessed with a baby girl, our little angel, and I fell in love again. She became our life. For the next years to come, every decision we took, <em>I</em> took was to make sure our daughter has the best life.</p> <p>I grew professionally. I proved my worth and gained respect amongst colleagues. And when that started dwindling towards the end of the decade, I decided it was time to move on to a new job. By this time, I was pretty clear what I wanted out of my carrier and thankfully I found a place and a role that could provide me with that.</p> <p>I identified my interests outside of work. And they have managed to provide me with the stability, the sanity in my lone times.</p> <p>As I look back at the years gone by, I can&#x2019;t help but think this was indeed <em>the</em> most important decade of my life.</p> <p>If there was one common theme that defined this decade for me was the decisions, the life-altering decisions I had to make throughout the past 10 years. The decisions that would make or break my life.</p> <p>And I think I have managed to come out unscathed. Bruised, scraped now and then, sure. But not marred. I feel satisfied with that.</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s me <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/10-year-challenge\">looking inwards</a> at the start of the year on how the past 10 years have affected me.</p> <blockquote> <p>the fidgety teen from 10 years back has given way to the calmer, saner, thoughtful self of today. I feel content within and that is the most important thing.</p> </blockquote> <p>No doubt, today&#x2019;s is a changed, improved me over 10-years-younger myself. But if the decade gone by was defined by the <em>decisions</em>, I believe it would be the <em>balance</em> that defines the next decade - a balance between change and stability. Exciting times!</p>\n",
