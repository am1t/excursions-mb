				"title": "Through the Dark Clouds - A Short Story",
				"content_html": "<p>The lady on the microphone announced in her squeaky voice, &ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Mumbai airport.&rdquo; Oas groaned, closed his eyes, and contorted his face like only an exasperated 75-year-old can. Having heard her numerous times in the last couple of hours, he was tired of listening to her any more.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Does she think I&rsquo;ve never been to an airport before?&rdquo; he muttered under his breath. &ldquo;Bah. I&rsquo;ve been on planes for longer than she&rsquo;s been on earth!&rdquo; The staff was running helter-skelter on the airport with some angst that Oas couldn&rsquo;t fathom. &ldquo;<em>Freaks</em>,&rdquo; he sighed in disappointment.</p>\n\n<p>The constant low hum of the music from the headphones of the young guy beside Oas didn&rsquo;t help his mood either. As the guy shuffled in his seat, the huge laptop on his lap brushed against Oas&rsquo;s arm again.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Do you want my lap too?&rdquo; Oas blurted out loudly as he knew the guy couldn&rsquo;t hear him. &ldquo;Take it, I am happy to help you save the world which is what I assume you must be doing,&rdquo; he continued muttering. The guy hardly budged.</p>\n\n<p>Bored of the one-way conversation, Oas got up and stood gawking at the hustle-bustle around. He was a lost alien amidst the time-poor professionals. He walked to a television screen in the lounge playing CNN. A news scroll read about a novel disease spreading through China. The main news being run on the channel though was about a kid at the Mumbai airport traveling alone. Oas massaged his forehead in disdain, wondered why this was news, and walked away.</p>\n\n<p>He began to stroll around the airport. He had to buy nothing, but he also dearly wanted to interact with another human being. He wandered through the Crosswords bookstore, hoping a salesperson would ask him if he needed any help. No one did. Lacking the patience to browse around the towering walls of disparate books, he walked straight to the bestseller section. He glanced at all the self-help books crowding the non-fiction racks. The fiction ones were full of tales from fantasy\nworlds. Oas was fond of neither; so he strolled out. </p>\n\n<p>He saw a deserted coffee stall. Hoping that the person selling coffee would be as bored as he was, Oas walked to him. The person was seated on a low stool chair; to Oas&rsquo;s disappointment, even he was lost in his smartphone&rsquo;s screen.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s hot?&rdquo; Oas asked the guy with a wish it would trigger some small talk.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We only sell coffee here,&rdquo; responded the guy without glancing away from the glowing screen.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Do you serve it hot?&rdquo; Oas quipped.</p>\n\n<p>The guy hadn&rsquo;t looked at Oas yet; he didn&rsquo;t even now. He jerked his face towards the coffee vending machine and said, &ldquo;We serve it however this machine dispenses.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>With all his hopes for even a meaningless interaction crushed, Oas ordered a cup. The guy shrugged in annoyance, got up and walked to the machine. He served the coffee with eyes as dull as sloth&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Sorry to put you through so much trouble, my friend,&rdquo; mocked Oas. The sarcasm in his voice was lost on the mindless guy. He responded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>With a bitter taste in his mouth, Oas walked back to the gate buzzing now with the regular pre-boarding bustle. A lot of people had gotten up in the anticipation that the queuing would start soon. &ldquo;<em>Would they prefer to stand up longer just to be ahead in the boarding queue?&rdquo;</em> Oas wondered. <em>&ldquo;Just so that they could sit inside the plane longer?&rdquo;</em> The rationality behind the thought had always stumped him.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Mr Puri?&rdquo; Oas heard a soft voice calling for him. He turned to face a flight attendant, smiling a very plastic smile at him.  The nametag on her read &lsquo;Anjali&rsquo;. Oas stopped himself from telling her that she had unnecessarily puffed her face with makeup. She had helped Oas earlier at the check-in counter; he had stopped himself even then. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Would you please follow me?&rdquo; It sounded more like a command to Oas than a request.</p>\n\n<p>He looked at her, puzzled. He couldn&rsquo;t think of any reason why he should follow her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok, Anjali,&rdquo; he said curtly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need any help.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sir, we have a priority boarding policy for all the senior citizens,&rdquo; she spoke without letting her two pepper-red lips touch one another for long. &ldquo;We will get you on the plane first.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Oas stared at her like a child would at his examiner. <em>&ldquo;Why does the world make us elders feel a lot more helpless than we are?&rdquo;</em> He didn&rsquo;t have much choice though; the stewardess looked adamant. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Fine. But I would need to be taken care of. I don&rsquo;t want to get stuffed in and forgotten,&rdquo; instructed Oas.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t happen, sir.&rdquo; The plastic smile didn&rsquo;t leave Anjali&rsquo;s face.</p>\n\n<p>Oas followed her. He was stuffed into the plane. And forgotten.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Oas looked at the kid from the CNN news report boarding along with Anjali. He wished the kid wasn&rsquo;t sitting anywhere close to him. Sure, Oas was yearning for interaction with another human being, but he was convinced that kids didn&rsquo;t fit that category. He did not hate them. He just believed they were dispatched by God to make people live through misery right on earth for the sins they have committed.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Kids are too clumsy,&rdquo; he used to tell his wife, Sara, &ldquo;and too stupid to spend any time with. All they can do is leave you more frustrated than you were before.&rdquo; Sara, on the other hand, believed they were godsent to spread joy amongst the grieving souls, to teach them valuable lessons about life. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why God sent us no child. We are not grieving, you see.&rdquo; She used to joke with tears soon shimmering in her eyes. Oas let her settle with her fantasy.</p>\n\n<p>Oas saw the kid follow Anjali till they reached right next to where he was seated. She started pushing the kid&rsquo;s backpack inside the overhead compartment. Oas dropped his face in his palm; the kid saw him do that.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Avik, this is your seat, right next to nice Mr Puri here,&rdquo; introduced Anjali. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you would enjoy your flight.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Oas saw the kid slide onto the seat next to him and blurt, &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Avik shuffled into his seat by the aisle. He looked towards the open overhead compartment. Then he stuck his neck out into the empty aisle. He wanted to see someone around; he didn&rsquo;t. Displeasure cloaked his innocent face. He then looked at Oas who had picked up a magazine and was clearly pretending to be engrossed in it.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What are you reading, Mr Puri?&rdquo; Avik was looking curiously at Oas.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Nothing that will interest you,&rdquo; Oas answered curtly without looking at him once.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you like reading Mr Puri,&rdquo; continued Avik. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look too interested in that book. My mum says if you enjoy doing something, you are always very busy doing it. So much that you won&rsquo;t even answer a question from someone else.&rdquo; Avik had pulled out the envelope kept in the seatback pocket and rummaged through what was inside. &ldquo;I never answer my mum when I am watching cartoons, you know, because I looooveee cartoons.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Avik was doing nothing to thwart Oas&rsquo;s beliefs about kids, rather, he was only making them firmer. &ldquo;Why are you alone, kid? Why are you not with your mum?&rdquo; Oas asked while putting the magazine back into the envelope.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in Bangalore. My father is also in Bangalore,&rdquo; said Avik while pulling out the printed safety instruction manual.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Why are <em>you</em> not with your mum?&rdquo; Oas asked again, thinking, &ldquo;of course <em>kids never answer the question that&rsquo;s asked&rdquo;</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Because they are not in Mumbai?&rdquo; Avik shook his head a couple of times and continued staring at the pictures in the security manual. &ldquo;I was living with my grandma here. She is very old &ndash;&rdquo; Avik paused and looked at Oas&rsquo;s face again. &ldquo;Not as old as you, though. But she still says she can&rsquo;t fly; she says she is afraid.&rdquo; Avik wasn&rsquo;t accustomed to staying silent. &ldquo;I am not afraid at all. My mum says I am very strong.&rdquo; Oas himself had started rummaging through the envelope now, searching for\nheadphones that he could plug his ears with. &ldquo;She says I am stronger than all my friends in the school. Rohit, Sid, everyone. Neil does beat me sometimes, but I always hit him back. My mum says I am stronger than even my father. My father -&rdquo; Oas had found the headphones and had quickly plugged his ears shut. He looked at Avik; he could see his lips\nmove, but heard no sound at all. He breathed a sigh of relief. He was happy that he had booked a first-class ticket; at least they provided the customers noise-cancelling headphones.</p>\n\n<p>Oas saw Anjali standing by the gate welcoming the other passengers that were boarding the flight now. He watched a couple enter the flight with a baby. The father was walking in front carrying all the luggage. The new-mom was struggling to carry the baby through the narrow aisle without letting even its sock touch anybody around. <em>&ldquo;That kid&rsquo;s going to wail throughout the flight now.&rdquo;</em> Oas let out a deep sigh.</p>\n\n<p>The guy with the huge laptop under his arm and headphones over his head walked in next. Oas smirked looking at him. &ldquo;The Avenger,&rdquo; he muttered and chuckled at his joke.</p>\n\n<p>Oas felt a pat on his arm; Avik was gesturing at him to remove his headphones. Oas didn&rsquo;t want to, but Avik had shifted his attention to work the seat belt that was holding him in his place. Worried the kid would set himself free, he pulled them away and gave Avik a probing look.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what I was saying, Mr Puri?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t. You see &hellip;&rdquo; Oas pointed at his headphones. &ldquo;&hellip; I was listening to music. Now that is something I like doing, kid.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Why do you keep calling me &lsquo;kid&rsquo;? Everyone else calls me &lsquo;Avik&rsquo;. My mum says she spent many days thinking before she settled on that name. You know what it means?&rdquo; Without waiting for Oas to speak a word, he bent his arms, flexing his biceps. &ldquo;It means brave, just who I am, my mum says. But she always cries when she says that, though.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The last statement made Oas freeze in his place. He saw a moving image flash in front of his eyes; of Sara hunched down next to Oas, laughing and crying at the same time. <em>&ldquo;Oh, I know you are brave, Oas!&rdquo;</em> He could recall Sara lying to him, preparing him for something he just wasn&rsquo;t ready for.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Why does she cry?&rdquo; He asked Avik in a much softer voice suddenly.</p>\n\n<p>Avik shrugged, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He continued his assault on the seat belt.</p>\n\n<p>Oas continued to stare at the kid, gloomy thoughts clouding his mind. Feeling increasingly restless, he asked, &ldquo;Are you going back to your mum?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m. Grandma says my mum&rsquo;s missing me. She always misses me.&rdquo; Avik had given up on his fight with the seat belt. &ldquo;Who are you going back to?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No one. I am going back to being alone.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Alone? Do you like living alone? Don&rsquo;t you have a family? My mum says everyone has one.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The innocence in the kid&rsquo;s voice caught Oas off guard. &ldquo;I had, once. I don&rsquo;t now since my wife&hellip; uhmmm&hellip; you know - &rdquo; Oas wasn&rsquo;t sure if the kid was old enough to understand the concept of death. This was one more reason he didn&rsquo;t like spending time with kids. &ldquo;<em>They could keep making the mindless fart jokes around you, but say &lsquo;shit&rsquo; around a kid and the whole world starts judging you,&rdquo;</em> he always complained. Sara was good at manoeuvring such situations; Oas wasn&rsquo;t.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What? Did your wife die?&ldquo; </p>\n\n<p>Oas was taken aback by this unexpected straightforwardness. He gulped the heaviness of the moment down his throat and nodded.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;But she did love you, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Oas nodded again. &ldquo;So, why are you alone then? She must be still around, you know?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Oas looked at the kid expressionless. His mind was full of questions that he knew he would get no answers for from this unripe mind.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;My mum says the people that love you do not go anywhere even if they die. They do disappear but continue to stay around. They never leave you.&rdquo; He was busy unfolding and folding the tray table over his lap now. &ldquo;My mum says she also is never going to leave me alone. I don&rsquo;t know why she keeps saying that; I know she won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Everyone around had settled down into their seats now. A calmness spread through the plane that Oas didn&rsquo;t share. Uneasy, he stared out the window into the darkness outside, illuminated by the occasional flash of lightning. Within, he was storming through the dreary thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>Anjali was now ready with the security demonstrations. She was used to being ignored, but the kid craned his neck to take in every word she said. Oas, on the other hand, was lost in his thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Uhhh &hellip; Why do they rush through these security instructions? Do they even want people to understand them?&rdquo; Oas looked at him struggling with the seat belt again. He finally got it open and squeaked an enthusiastic &ldquo;yay&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;Cabin crew, prepare for take-off please.&rdquo;</em> Oas heard the Captain announce. Avik was jumping up and down on his seat; he didn&rsquo;t look alone any more. Oas unbuckled his seat belt, stretched towards the kid and put him back tied to his seat belt. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you unbuckle the seat belt now. Your mum won&rsquo;t want you to do that.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Avik settled back into his seat. Oas locked his stare at the darkness outside. The flight took off, passing through the stormy clouds. The raindrops pattered against the window and then stopped suddenly as the plane cut through the low dark clouds.</p>\n\n<p>Avik had unknowingly slid his hand around Oas&rsquo;s arm. Oas smiled at Avik. &ldquo;Your mum&rsquo;s right. You <em>are</em> a brave child.&rdquo;</p>\n",
				"content_text": "The lady on the microphone announced in her squeaky voice, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Mumbai airport.\" Oas groaned, closed his eyes, and contorted his face like only an exasperated 75-year-old can. Having heard her numerous times in the last couple of hours, he was tired of listening to her any more.\n\n\"Does she think I've never been to an airport before?\" he muttered under his breath. \"Bah. I've been on planes for longer than she's been on earth!\" The staff was running helter-skelter on the airport with some angst that Oas couldn't fathom. \"*Freaks*,\" he sighed in disappointment.\n\nThe constant low hum of the music from the headphones of the young guy beside Oas didn't help his mood either. As the guy shuffled in his seat, the huge laptop on his lap brushed against Oas's arm again.\n\n\"Do you want my lap too?\" Oas blurted out loudly as he knew the guy couldn't hear him. \"Take it, I am happy to help you save the world which is what I assume you must be doing,\" he continued muttering. The guy hardly budged.\n\nBored of the one-way conversation, Oas got up and stood gawking at the hustle-bustle around. He was a lost alien amidst the time-poor professionals. He walked to a television screen in the lounge playing CNN. A news scroll read about a novel disease spreading through China. The main news being run on the channel though was about a kid at the Mumbai airport traveling alone. Oas massaged his forehead in disdain, wondered why this was news, and walked away.\n\nHe began to stroll around the airport. He had to buy nothing, but he also dearly wanted to interact with another human being. He wandered through the Crosswords bookstore, hoping a salesperson would ask him if he needed any help. No one did. Lacking the patience to browse around the towering walls of disparate books, he walked straight to the bestseller section. He glanced at all the self-help books crowding the non-fiction racks. The fiction ones were full of tales from fantasy\nworlds. Oas was fond of neither; so he strolled out. \n\nHe saw a deserted coffee stall. Hoping that the person selling coffee would be as bored as he was, Oas walked to him. The person was seated on a low stool chair; to Oas's disappointment, even he was lost in his smartphone's screen.\n\n\"What's hot?\" Oas asked the guy with a wish it would trigger some small talk.\n\n\"We only sell coffee here,\" responded the guy without glancing away from the glowing screen.\n\n\"Do you serve it hot?\" Oas quipped.\n\nThe guy hadn't looked at Oas yet; he didn't even now. He jerked his face towards the coffee vending machine and said, \"We serve it however this machine dispenses.\"\n\nWith all his hopes for even a meaningless interaction crushed, Oas ordered a cup. The guy shrugged in annoyance, got up and walked to the machine. He served the coffee with eyes as dull as sloth's. \"Sorry to put you through so much trouble, my friend,\" mocked Oas. The sarcasm in his voice was lost on the mindless guy. He responded, \"It's alright.\"\n\nWith a bitter taste in his mouth, Oas walked back to the gate buzzing now with the regular pre-boarding bustle. A lot of people had gotten up in the anticipation that the queuing would start soon. \"*Would they prefer to stand up longer just to be ahead in the boarding queue?\"* Oas wondered. *\"Just so that they could sit inside the plane longer?\"* The rationality behind the thought had always stumped him.\n\n\"Mr Puri?\" Oas heard a soft voice calling for him. He turned to face a flight attendant, smiling a very plastic smile at him.  The nametag on her read 'Anjali'. Oas stopped himself from telling her that she had unnecessarily puffed her face with makeup. She had helped Oas earlier at the check-in counter; he had stopped himself even then. \n\n\"Would you please follow me?\" It sounded more like a command to Oas than a request.\n\nHe looked at her, puzzled. He couldn't think of any reason why he should follow her. \"I'm ok, Anjali,\" he said curtly. \"I don't need any help.\"\n\n\"Sir, we have a priority boarding policy for all the senior citizens,\" she spoke without letting her two pepper-red lips touch one another for long. \"We will get you on the plane first.\"\n\nOas stared at her like a child would at his examiner. *\"Why does the world make us elders feel a lot more helpless than we are?\"* He didn't have much choice though; the stewardess looked adamant. \n\n\"Fine. But I would need to be taken care of. I don't want to get stuffed in and forgotten,\" instructed Oas.\n\n\"Won't happen, sir.\" The plastic smile didn't leave Anjali's face.\n\nOas followed her. He was stuffed into the plane. And forgotten.\n\n---\n\nOas looked at the kid from the CNN news report boarding along with Anjali. He wished the kid wasn't sitting anywhere close to him. Sure, Oas was yearning for interaction with another human being, but he was convinced that kids didn't fit that category. He did not hate them. He just believed they were dispatched by God to make people live through misery right on earth for the sins they have committed.\n\n\"Kids are too clumsy,\" he used to tell his wife, Sara, \"and too stupid to spend any time with. All they can do is leave you more frustrated than you were before.\" Sara, on the other hand, believed they were godsent to spread joy amongst the grieving souls, to teach them valuable lessons about life. \"That's why God sent us no child. We are not grieving, you see.\" She used to joke with tears soon shimmering in her eyes. Oas let her settle with her fantasy.\n\nOas saw the kid follow Anjali till they reached right next to where he was seated. She started pushing the kid's backpack inside the overhead compartment. Oas dropped his face in his palm; the kid saw him do that.\n\n\"Avik, this is your seat, right next to nice Mr Puri here,\" introduced Anjali. \"I'm sure you would enjoy your flight.\"\n\nOas saw the kid slide onto the seat next to him and blurt, \"Thank you!\"\n\nAvik shuffled into his seat by the aisle. He looked towards the open overhead compartment. Then he stuck his neck out into the empty aisle. He wanted to see someone around; he didn't. Displeasure cloaked his innocent face. He then looked at Oas who had picked up a magazine and was clearly pretending to be engrossed in it.\n\n\"What are you reading, Mr Puri?\" Avik was looking curiously at Oas.\n\n\"Nothing that will interest you,\" Oas answered curtly without looking at him once.\n\n\"I don't think you like reading Mr Puri,\" continued Avik. \"You don't look too interested in that book. My mum says if you enjoy doing something, you are always very busy doing it. So much that you won't even answer a question from someone else.\" Avik had pulled out the envelope kept in the seatback pocket and rummaged through what was inside. \"I never answer my mum when I am watching cartoons, you know, because I looooveee cartoons.\"\n\nAvik was doing nothing to thwart Oas's beliefs about kids, rather, he was only making them firmer. \"Why are you alone, kid? Why are you not with your mum?\" Oas asked while putting the magazine back into the envelope.\n\n\"She's in Bangalore. My father is also in Bangalore,\" said Avik while pulling out the printed safety instruction manual.\n\n\"Why are *you* not with your mum?\" Oas asked again, thinking, \"of course *kids never answer the question that's asked\"*.\n\n\"Because they are not in Mumbai?\" Avik shook his head a couple of times and continued staring at the pictures in the security manual. \"I was living with my grandma here. She is very old --\" Avik paused and looked at Oas's face again. \"Not as old as you, though. But she still says she can't fly; she says she is afraid.\" Avik wasn't accustomed to staying silent. \"I am not afraid at all. My mum says I am very strong.\" Oas himself had started rummaging through the envelope now, searching for\nheadphones that he could plug his ears with. \"She says I am stronger than all my friends in the school. Rohit, Sid, everyone. Neil does beat me sometimes, but I always hit him back. My mum says I am stronger than even my father. My father -\" Oas had found the headphones and had quickly plugged his ears shut. He looked at Avik; he could see his lips\nmove, but heard no sound at all. He breathed a sigh of relief. He was happy that he had booked a first-class ticket; at least they provided the customers noise-cancelling headphones.\n\nOas saw Anjali standing by the gate welcoming the other passengers that were boarding the flight now. He watched a couple enter the flight with a baby. The father was walking in front carrying all the luggage. The new-mom was struggling to carry the baby through the narrow aisle without letting even its sock touch anybody around. *\"That kid's going to wail throughout the flight now.\"* Oas let out a deep sigh.\n\nThe guy with the huge laptop under his arm and headphones over his head walked in next. Oas smirked looking at him. \"The Avenger,\" he muttered and chuckled at his joke.\n\nOas felt a pat on his arm; Avik was gesturing at him to remove his headphones. Oas didn't want to, but Avik had shifted his attention to work the seat belt that was holding him in his place. Worried the kid would set himself free, he pulled them away and gave Avik a probing look.\n\n\"Did you hear what I was saying, Mr Puri?\"\n\n\"Sorry, I didn't. You see ...\" Oas pointed at his headphones. \"... I was listening to music. Now that is something I like doing, kid.\"\n\n\"Why do you keep calling me 'kid'? Everyone else calls me 'Avik'. My mum says she spent many days thinking before she settled on that name. You know what it means?\" Without waiting for Oas to speak a word, he bent his arms, flexing his biceps. \"It means brave, just who I am, my mum says. But she always cries when she says that, though.\"\n\nThe last statement made Oas freeze in his place. He saw a moving image flash in front of his eyes; of Sara hunched down next to Oas, laughing and crying at the same time. *\"Oh, I know you are brave, Oas!\"* He could recall Sara lying to him, preparing him for something he just wasn't ready for.\n\n\"Why does she cry?\" He asked Avik in a much softer voice suddenly.\n\nAvik shrugged, \"I don't know.\" He continued his assault on the seat belt.\n\nOas continued to stare at the kid, gloomy thoughts clouding his mind.

I have rarely used that adjective for a documentary. But this one is so very different. I cannot fathom someone&rsquo;s possession for their passion can blind them to the risks rather conspicuous to the rest. I was aware of the free soloing as a form of climbing. What took me by surprise was the level of planning that goes into the preparation. In hindsight, it was foolish of me to think that wasn&rsquo;t the case, that the act was spontaneous.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n\n<p><h3>1917</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>I can&rsquo;t think of a better way to captures the immediacy of war than how <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/sam_mendes\">Sam Mendes</a> does with 1917. The single-take narration grips one right from the beginning and never lets off even for a moment. I was with the characters throughout their journey, feeling their anxiety, their pain. I entered every new terrain, turned every dark corner equally uneasy. What Mendes and his cinematographer Roger Deakins manage to achieve is absolute brilliance. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and was left gasping by the end. A cinematic masterpiece.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n\n<p><h3>Greyhound</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Another war flick that, sure, aimed to be different. A fast-paced action thriller about battleships is not very common. However, the economical 75 minutes of the runtime itself felt too long. The fights felt repetitive and with no other thread to hold the plot together, it was easy to skip over. Tom Hanks sells the character though. However, I am tired now of seeing him play the perfect guy. He needs to play some grey characters now, someone with a few flaws. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n\n<p><h3>Bonus - Quarantine Special</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>I also <em>finally</em> watched the Quarantine special episode of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8879940/\" target=\"_blank\">Mythic Quest</a>. This is <em>the</em> best show on Apple TV+, period. And this special episode was exactly what I needed now &ndash; an understanding of what I and most of us are going through in current times. What&rsquo;s commendable is that it does so without giving up on the hilarity. As the episode came to the climax, it had me jumping with momentary joy. With my eyes full of happy, hopeful tears and my fists clenched, <em>[spoiler alert]</em> I joined Ian to shout out loud &ldquo;Fuck you Coronavirus&rdquo;.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n",

I have rarely used that adjective for a documentary. But this one is so very different. I cannot fathom someone's possession for their passion can blind them to the risks rather conspicuous to the rest. I was aware of the free soloing as a form of climbing. What took me by surprise was the level of planning that goes into the preparation. In hindsight, it was foolish of me to think that wasn't the case, that the act was spontaneous.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>1917</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I can't think of a better way to captures the immediacy of war than how <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/sam_mendes\">Sam Mendes</a> does with 1917. The single-take narration grips one right from the beginning and never lets off even for a moment. I was with the characters throughout their journey, feeling their anxiety, their pain. I entered every new terrain, turned every dark corner equally uneasy. What Mendes and his cinematographer Roger Deakins manage to achieve is absolute brilliance. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and was left gasping by the end. A cinematic masterpiece.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Greyhound</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another war flick that, sure, aimed to be different. A fast-paced action thriller about battleships is not very common. However, the economical 75 minutes of the runtime itself felt too long. The fights felt repetitive and with no other thread to hold the plot together, it was easy to skip over. Tom Hanks sells the character though. However, I am tired now of seeing him play the perfect guy. He needs to play some grey characters now, someone with a few flaws. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Bonus - Quarantine Special</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also <em>finally</em> watched the Quarantine special episode of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8879940/\" target=\"_blank\">Mythic Quest</a>. This is <em>the</em> best show on Apple TV+, period. And this special episode was exactly what I needed now -- an understanding of what I and most of us are going through in current times. What's commendable is that it does so without giving up on the hilarity. As the episode came to the climax, it had me jumping with momentary joy. With my eyes full of happy, hopeful tears and my fists clenched, <em>[spoiler alert]</em> I joined Ian to shout out loud \"Fuck you Coronavirus\".</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I believe I haven&rsquo;t managed to get rid of my trait yet. It might be time to think about getting rid of this habit.

I'd decided <a href=\"http://amitgawande.com/slow-down-be-present/\">to stop doing that</a>. But while I wrote that, I hadn't realized that there is deeper malady there -- my subconscious quest to be a perfectionist. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I was reading an essay <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-dangerous-downsides-of-perfectionism\" target=\"_blank\">about the downsides of perfectionism </a>from Amanda Ruggeri at BBC, it made me aware that I've also been affected by the same trait she was warning about. I want things to be done perfectly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At home. At work. With the activities that I do on my own. With my family. With my peers, my superiors.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is that perfectionist voice within me that's constantly judging me, judging others. Even now, am thinking and rethinking on the ways I could word this prose. This paragraph. <em>Is it the best way to make my point?</em> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why? Why do I do that? It can't be healthy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even on Google, the first autocomplete suggestion for \"Perfectionism\" is \"Perfectionism is a disease\". I wouldn't term this trait as that -- I don't want to flippantly use a word while representing any form of mental disorder -- it ain't a \"disease\" for sure. However, even an offhand read through the internet would convince you that perfectionism can lead to a laundry list of such disorders. Anxiety. Depression. And much more.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I am not sure if my habit of aiming for perfection in every task is affecting my mood and my mind in any alarming way yet. However, I think it does lead me to procrastinate at times. <em>I don't have time now, will do it later \"perfectly,\"</em> I can hear my mind say every now and then.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, it's believed and acknowledged to be a vicious cycle - perfectionism, procrastination and paralysis. Or thought another way, it is the paralysis by analysis. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis\" target=\"_blank\">Analysis paralysis</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All this lead me to <a href=\"https://amitgawande.com/stop-overthinking/\">a post I wrote back in 2013</a>, on exactly the same topic of over-analyzing, overthinking. And it was then that I had linked to this term of Analysis paralysis for the first time. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That was 7 years ago. I believe I haven't managed to get rid of my trait yet. It might be time to think about getting rid of this habit. To not let my pursuit for things to be perfect to affect me, to paralyze me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

He felt he heard a constant buzzing sound; he wasn’t hearing any now. He attempted to gain his full senses. He looked at the dimmed screen of his iPhone; it hadn’t woken him up as there were no new notifications. He wasn’t fully awake yet as he could hardly see anything around through his dizzy eyes. He attempted to see the time again on his iPhone; the screen read 03:28. He didn’t feel thirsty nor did he want to take a leak. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>He got up and tottered along the floor to the bathroom. &ldquo;<em>I am awake anyway, might as well go visit the bathroom</em>&rdquo;. He got back to the still, dark room. The clock on the wall read 03:30 now.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Just as he fell flat facedown on the bed, the sound hit him again. He could clearly hear the steady, deep buzzing noise that had woken him; he was absolutely certain it wasn’t coming from something in his room. He got up, this time fully awake, wide-eyed. He was convinced it was a sound he had heard before, a rattle of sorts on a wooden top. He got out of his bedroom; he was certain now that the sound was coming from downstairs. He tried to calm his mind, suspecting it was his loneliness that was playing games.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Raghav stepped onto the first stair and the sound stopped with the first creak of the wooden stairs below his feet.

Junk emails always end up reaching my inbox.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>This hasn&rsquo;t been the case with HEY.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I paused at that last word in the title. I was so close to writing \"hooked\". But then I thought have they really sold the promise yet? No doubt, they are close. But, it's not a done deal yet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why is this service so enticing though? I mean it's just an email service. I <a href=\"https://micro.blog/amit/9837640\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">don't even use the email</a> that much. So why do I keep going back to HEY? It has got something to do with their promise.

Junk emails always end up reaching my inbox.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This hasn't been the case with HEY.

				"title": "Every Pixar Movie Ranked *",
				"content_html": "<!-- wp:image -->\n\n<p><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2020/9cb9eb4dad.jpg\" alt=\"Pixar Animation Studios\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Vox Media has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/6/27/18715845/pixar-movies-rankings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an updating list</a> of all the Pixar movies, ranked by their Culture team from worst to best. They have been doing this since last year. So it is interesting to see the list updated with every Pixar release.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n\n<p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Since the release of its very first feature film, <em>Toy Story</em>, in 1995, Pixar has become one of Hollywood’s most celebrated animation studios. Ranging from superhero adventures to tales of a lonely robot on a post-apocalyptic Earth, the studio’s 22 movies to date have earned plaudits for being artistically adventurous and telling stories ostensibly aimed at kids that have just as many adult fans.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Yep, absolutely. I whole-heartedly agree. I and my family <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/1591546306141\">had recently watched Onward</a> and had thoroughly enjoyed it. So when Vox says lets <span class=\"pull-double\">”</span> take a look back at the high highs and low-ish lows of the acclaimed animation studio”, even I want to attempt that. I do not agree with Vox Culture team’s ranking. So I want to put my own rankings out there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p><b>*</b> <i>Nope, not gonna do that.</i> I can’t rank all of them. <i>There are 22</i> — how can you ever say if The Bug’s Life is worse than Cars 2. So, I will just give out my top ten; this is not a commentary in any sense. I am not a film critic. I can’t explain why one is artistically better than the other. What I can say is why I like, nah, <i>love</i> each movie in here.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n\n<p><h3><b>10. Cars (2006)</b></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>As far as I can recall, this was one of the early movies I saw from the Pixar studio and I was left completely mesmerized. It was also the first time I realized how emotional an animated movie can leave you. The story was wonderful, made me emotional at many moments. And it wove the same magic for my daughter. So this remains a special movie, to this day; doesn’t matter if it is actually a good movie or not.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n\n<p><h3>9. Onward (2020)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>We watched the one the most recently as we were stuck at home for more than 3 months. And the fun we had as a family throughout was completely unforgettable. It made us laugh, made us cry and at times even terrified. It made us forget about all the terrible news that was spread through the world outside — makes it a very special movie for me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n\n<p><h3>8. Monsters Inc. (2001)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Again, another of the early movies from Pixar. I wasn’t a parent then, but it made me aware for the first time what parenting would be. As I watched Sulley and Mike struggle to keep Boo safe, at the same time growing closer to her, it made me worried and equally excited for the parent that I was one day going to be. I fell in love with Boo as she expressed myriad of expressions through her toddler face.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n\n<p><h3>7. Inside Out (2015)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>This has to be one of the smartest and most creative animated movies ever made. Such a creative story stitched into a brilliant movie. The colours, the characters, their journeys alone and together. How they drove the central human character was fascinating. This was again a movie that made me realize what I need not do around my daughter as she reaches adolescence one day. The story was clever, the execution was top-notch and the emotional attachment was to the point.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n\n<p><h3>6. Wall-E (2008)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Another clever movie from Pixar. The first half without any spoken words was absolutely brilliant. I still can’t fathom how the studio made us fall in love with a squarish droid. He doesn’t speak, he doesn’t have any human features. But he expressed so many emotions that many of the well-paid actors fail to do. Wall-E’s struggle to express his love for Eve had me root for this lovely droid throughout the movie. Wish humans didn’t arrive later in the movie to spoil what could have been the finest movie of all times.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n\n<p><h3><b>5. Toy Story (1995)</b></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Another movie that I watched way back in my teens when I had started to believe I had become too grown up to watch animated movies any more. Pixar prove me wrong — boy what a masterpiece this one is. A movie with a brilliant story that also teaches you so much. Still being so much fun at the same time. Toy Story completely defined the roadmap for future animated films — they had to cater to the kids and the adults with a kid within at the same time. This movie did it so perfectly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n\n<p><h3><b>4. Coco (2017)</b></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>I love music. And I love getting emotional while watching a movie. Especially if it weaves stories around families. So Coco fit just the right spots for me. Boy, oh boy. Such a wonderful ride it was. Those mesmerizing colours. The peppy, moving music. The story that has you gripped throughout. Coco was an experience of a kind. Again, such a meaningful movie that teaches you the importance of a family. I had a tear rolling down my cheek during the final reunion song.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n\n<p><h3><b>3. Finding Nemo (2003)</b></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Another film that touched my yet-to-be-a-parent’s heart. I was rooting for the worried, clown-fish dad throughout his transformation. And I can’t recall how many more times have I rooted for this guy since then. I watch this movie every now and then with my daughter. She loves it; she asks me many questions about what plays out in the movie. I pull her close to me into a hug and answer her to the best of my abilities. Knowing very well, that soon she too would want to explore more and I would have to stop being overprotective and let her do that. Anyway, see that’s what even thinking about this movie does to me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n\n<p><h3>2. Toy Story 3 (2010)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>There’s just so much to love about this movie. The friendship, the bond that we’ve seen grow over the 3 movies, comes so close to a culmination here. Full of laughter. Full of life-lessons. Full of heartbreaks. This is one hell of a movie - not just an animated one. Period. As Woody looks at Andy walking away while sitting close to Bonny towards the end, am sobbing away with joy. There are so many plots here and each one betters the last. This one is a string of masterclass at film making, one after another.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n\n<p><h3>1. Up (2009)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Just with that masterful opening montage, this one enters my top ten list any day. I had a lump in my throat right at the beginning. The movie follows it up with weaving such a beautiful story about Carl and his relation with Russel and the many friends he makes over their journey to Paradise Falls. I loved each character in this movie. Russel. Kevin. Dug. Even Muntz for that matter. The movie had me empathize with this antagonist too before he goes all bat-shit crazy, that is. And of course, finally Carl. I loved Carl so much that I had one character based on him in my fictional short story series.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2020/9cb9eb4dad.jpg\" alt=\"Pixar Animation Studios\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Vox Media has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/6/27/18715845/pixar-movies-rankings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an updating list</a> of all the Pixar movies, ranked by their Culture team from worst to best. They have been doing this since last year. So it is interesting to see the list updated with every Pixar release.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Since the release of its very first feature film, <em>Toy Story</em>, in 1995, Pixar has become one of Hollywood’s most celebrated animation studios. Ranging from superhero adventures to tales of a lonely robot on a post-apocalyptic Earth, the studio’s 22 movies to date have earned plaudits for being artistically adventurous and telling stories ostensibly aimed at kids that have just as many adult fans.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yep, absolutely. I whole-heartedly agree. I and my family <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/1591546306141\">had recently watched Onward</a> and had thoroughly enjoyed it. So when Vox says lets <span class=\"pull-double\">”</span> take a look back at the high highs and low-ish lows of the acclaimed animation studio”, even I want to attempt that. I do not agree with Vox Culture team’s ranking. So I want to put my own rankings out there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><b>*</b> <i>Nope, not gonna do that.</i> I can’t rank all of them. <i>There are 22</i> — how can you ever say if The Bug’s Life is worse than Cars 2. So, I will just give out my top ten; this is not a commentary in any sense. I am not a film critic. I can’t explain why one is artistically better than the other. What I can say is why I like, nah, <i>love</i> each movie in here.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><b>10. Cars (2006)</b></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As far as I can recall, this was one of the early movies I saw from the Pixar studio and I was left completely mesmerized. It was also the first time I realized how emotional an animated movie can leave you. The story was wonderful, made me emotional at many moments. And it wove the same magic for my daughter. So this remains a special movie, to this day; doesn’t matter if it is actually a good movie or not.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>9. Onward (2020)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We watched the one the most recently as we were stuck at home for more than 3 months. And the fun we had as a family throughout was completely unforgettable. It made us laugh, made us cry and at times even terrified. It made us forget about all the terrible news that was spread through the world outside — makes it a very special movie for me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>8. Monsters Inc. (2001)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Again, another of the early movies from Pixar. I wasn’t a parent then, but it made me aware for the first time what parenting would be. As I watched Sulley and Mike struggle to keep Boo safe, at the same time growing closer to her, it made me worried and equally excited for the parent that I was one day going to be. I fell in love with Boo as she expressed myriad of expressions through her toddler face.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>7. Inside Out (2015)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This has to be one of the smartest and most creative animated movies ever made. Such a creative story stitched into a brilliant movie. The colours, the characters, their journeys alone and together. How they drove the central human character was fascinating. This was again a movie that made me realize what I need not do around my daughter as she reaches adolescence one day. The story was clever, the execution was top-notch and the emotional attachment was to the point.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>6. Wall-E (2008)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another clever movie from Pixar. The first half without any spoken words was absolutely brilliant. I still can’t fathom how the studio made us fall in love with a squarish droid. He doesn’t speak, he doesn’t have any human features. But he expressed so many emotions that many of the well-paid actors fail to do. Wall-E’s struggle to express his love for Eve had me root for this lovely droid throughout the movie. Wish humans didn’t arrive later in the movie to spoil what could have been the finest movie of all times.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><b>5. Toy Story (1995)</b></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another movie that I watched way back in my teens when I had started to believe I had become too grown up to watch animated movies any more. Pixar prove me wrong — boy what a masterpiece this one is. A movie with a brilliant story that also teaches you so much. Still being so much fun at the same time. Toy Story completely defined the roadmap for future animated films — they had to cater to the kids and the adults with a kid within at the same time. This movie did it so perfectly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><b>4. Coco (2017)</b></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I love music. And I love getting emotional while watching a movie. Especially if it weaves stories around families. So Coco fit just the right spots for me. Boy, oh boy. Such a wonderful ride it was. Those mesmerizing colours. The peppy, moving music. The story that has you gripped throughout. Coco was an experience of a kind. Again, such a meaningful movie that teaches you the importance of a family. I had a tear rolling down my cheek during the final reunion song.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><b>3. Finding Nemo (2003)</b></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another film that touched my yet-to-be-a-parent’s heart. I was rooting for the worried, clown-fish dad throughout his transformation. And I can’t recall how many more times have I rooted for this guy since then. I watch this movie every now and then with my daughter. She loves it; she asks me many questions about what plays out in the movie. I pull her close to me into a hug and answer her to the best of my abilities. Knowing very well, that soon she too would want to explore more and I would have to stop being overprotective and let her do that. Anyway, see that’s what even thinking about this movie does to me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>2. Toy Story 3 (2010)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s just so much to love about this movie. The friendship, the bond that we’ve seen grow over the 3 movies, comes so close to a culmination here. Full of laughter. Full of life-lessons. Full of heartbreaks. This is one hell of a movie - not just an animated one. Period. As Woody looks at Andy walking away while sitting close to Bonny towards the end, am sobbing away with joy. There are so many plots here and each one betters the last. This one is a string of masterclass at film making, one after another.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>1. Up (2009)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just with that masterful opening montage, this one enters my top ten list any day. I had a lump in my throat right at the beginning. The movie follows it up with weaving such a beautiful story about Carl and his relation with Russel and the many friends he makes over their journey to Paradise Falls. I loved each character in this movie. Russel. Kevin. Dug. Even Muntz for that matter. The movie had me empathize with this antagonist too before he goes all bat-shit crazy, that is. And of course, finally Carl. I loved Carl so much that I had one character based on him in my fictional short story series. Up will always remain a very special movie for me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Best Moments from other movies</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are of course many other movies from Pixar that didn’t make the list but have some brilliant scenes.

Melissa Pandika <a href=\"https://www.mic.com/p/the-emotional-toll-of-social-distancing-22610830\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">writes on Mic</a> about the emotional toll such social distancing precautions can take.</p> <blockquote> <p>Right now, even the simplest, purest of human gestures, the ones we crave most in times like these &#x2014; a hug or squeeze of our hand, reassuring us everything will turn out okay &#x2014; now carry risk.</p> </blockquote> <p>So true. There are already reports of how this is affecting families all around the world. I am afraid the chances are people will soon get fed-up, get impatient. They might stop caring about others, become isolated within. Become indifferent.</p> <p>Of course, another possibility is that this will bring immediate families even closer. I can do all that I do in a group while I am at home with family. I can decide not to isolate myself at home. I get focused hours for work and at the same time decide not to stay glued to the laptop throughout the day while working. Take the breaks that I usually take and spend that time with my family.</p> <p>There is no need to wind the working day down with media consumption as I can relieve stress throughout the day when required. Look beyond the mobile, tablet and television screens. I can spend the hours I generally wasted on commutes on something productive.</p> <p>Share stories. Hear from loved ones. Play with my daughter. Talk, chat, discuss, debate, tease. Laugh. Do everything I do at the office. And more.</p> <p>I think I will give this possibility a chance. Distance, not isolate. May be, social distancing, physically distancing myself from the outside world, will bring me emotionally closer to my family.</p>\n",

Video and audio conferencing feel too formal.</p> <p>This all can&#x2019;t be healthy - it is sure to have some psychological effect. Melissa Pandika <a href=\"https://www.mic.com/p/the-emotional-toll-of-social-distancing-22610830\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">writes on Mic</a> about the emotional toll such social distancing precautions can take.</p> <blockquote> <p>Right now, even the simplest, purest of human gestures, the ones we crave most in times like these &#x2014; a hug or squeeze of our hand, reassuring us everything will turn out okay &#x2014; now carry risk.</p> </blockquote> <p>So true. There are already reports of how this is affecting families all around the world. I am afraid the chances are people will soon get fed-up, get impatient. They might stop caring about others, become isolated within. Become indifferent.</p> <p>Of course, another possibility is that this will bring immediate families even closer. I can do all that I do in a group while I am at home with family. I can decide not to isolate myself at home. I get focused hours for work and at the same time decide not to stay glued to the laptop throughout the day while working. Take the breaks that I usually take and spend that time with my family.</p> <p>There is no need to wind the working day down with media consumption as I can relieve stress throughout the day when required. Look beyond the mobile, tablet and television screens. I can spend the hours I generally wasted on commutes on something productive.</p> <p>Share stories. Hear from loved ones. Play with my daughter. Talk, chat, discuss, debate, tease. Laugh. Do everything I do at the office. And more.</p> <p>I think I will give this possibility a chance. Distance, not isolate. May be, social distancing, physically distancing myself from the outside world, will bring me emotionally closer to my family.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Recently, I have been seriously considering moving my Wordpress account to a paid plan. It hosts <a href=\"https://snoozyrealm.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my old blog</a> with posts from ages ago&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;it currently acts as an archive of the un-migrated posts for me.</p> <p>There is a reason why I am a bit itchy with my writing workflow. I am struggling to get stuff written across systems, mainly mobile and desktops, at home and work, with drafts kept in sync. Sure, I can use Dropbox as my file store and access the draft posts using iA Writer or other Markdown text editors. However, I am very particular with not signing into and linking anything personal on my work machine, so this workflow does not work at work.</p> <p>I would have really liked something that is web based. I have been, since long, trying to find <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/1561697966995\">a micropub client</a> with a satisfying writing experience for long form posts, along with drafts support. I still haven&#x2019;t found one. Neither have my attempts to just create one ground up gone anywhere, mainly for the need for multiple working drafts.</p> <p>I do have a Netlify <span class=\"small-caps\">CMS</span> setup for my <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/\">main Hugo driven website</a>. However, though it works fine from a desktop, it has a terrible experience on mobile.</p> <p>Wordpress solves this particular problem for me. I have come to realize <em>finally</em> that it has a nice, clean writing interface on desktop. And with its stable mobile app, the workflow is manageable on mobile too.</p> <p>But, boy I am ruined by markdown - I can&#x2019;t write in<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Rich Text&#x201D; any more. Plus, I can&#x2019;t host my posts on a website which does not have the Indieweb principles baked in. I am aware that Wordpress has a IndieWeb plugin. However, one needs a business account to install plugins. And that&#x2019;s too much of a cost to sign up for this casual experiment.</p> <p>So my search for the online writing interface with support for sync and drafts and satisfactory interface on desktop and mobile continues. With Wordpress, it&#x2019;s so close, but far.</p>\n",

It hosts <a href=\"https://snoozyrealm.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my old blog</a> with posts from ages ago&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;it currently acts as an archive of the un-migrated posts for me.</p> <p>There is a reason why I am a bit itchy with my writing workflow. I am struggling to get stuff written across systems, mainly mobile and desktops, at home and work, with drafts kept in sync. Sure, I can use Dropbox as my file store and access the draft posts using iA Writer or other Markdown text editors. However, I am very particular with not signing into and linking anything personal on my work machine, so this workflow does not work at work.</p> <p>I would have really liked something that is web based. I have been, since long, trying to find <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/1561697966995\">a micropub client</a> with a satisfying writing experience for long form posts, along with drafts support. I still haven&#x2019;t found one. Neither have my attempts to just create one ground up gone anywhere, mainly for the need for multiple working drafts.</p> <p>I do have a Netlify <span class=\"small-caps\">CMS</span> setup for my <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/\">main Hugo driven website</a>. However, though it works fine from a desktop, it has a terrible experience on mobile.</p> <p>Wordpress solves this particular problem for me. I have come to realize <em>finally</em> that it has a nice, clean writing interface on desktop. And with its stable mobile app, the workflow is manageable on mobile too.</p> <p>But, boy I am ruined by markdown - I can&#x2019;t write in<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Rich Text&#x201D; any more. Plus, I can&#x2019;t host my posts on a website which does not have the Indieweb principles baked in. I am aware that Wordpress has a IndieWeb plugin. However, one needs a business account to install plugins. And that&#x2019;s too much of a cost to sign up for this casual experiment.</p> <p>So my search for the online writing interface with support for sync and drafts and satisfactory interface on desktop and mobile continues. With Wordpress, it&#x2019;s so close, but far.</p>\n",

They end up being a plain dump of words with no background.</p> <p>I can capture more context with analog methods&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;a quick sketch or the current location&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;but it isn&#x2019;t convenient. Either I do not have a piece of paper handy or I can&#x2019;t stop and capture the thought (being in middle of traffic, let&#x2019;s say) right at that moment.</p> <p>I am waiting for the day the digital assistants would be smarter to help capture such thought. Today they aren&#x2019;t. First, they can&#x2019;t be easily summoned&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;&#x201C;Ok Google&#x201D; or<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Hey Siri&#x201D; doesn&#x2019;t work in middle of traffic, blaring horns or loud chatters.</p> <p>Second, they are terrible at capturing unformed thoughts. They need structured inputs, which quick notes aren&#x2019;t. Using digital assistants today is a painful battle between reality and expectations. Former is driven by the technology limitations, later by the out-right spurious promises in the advertisements.</p> <p>With all said and done though, I have recently - and after enduring lot of pain - learned that heavy reliance on one&#x2019;s smartphone to lead a structured life is not very sensible to do. There is a chance that it can lead to utter chaos when you don&#x2019;t have your device on you. It can completely paralyze you for thoughts.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>It&#x2019;s been around a month since <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/1564027700657\">I started</a> maintaining a bullet journal (BuJo, as it is called <em>with love</em>). It has been an enlightening month - I have learned so much about my habits and the way my mind works.</p> <p>Of course, this wasn&#x2019;t my first attempt at maintaining a journal or of planning myself, my life through an organizer. There have been many <em>failed</em> new year resolutions that have led to me buying, keeping and planning my days and months in the traditional journals - ones with days, months written on every page. With every day that I had failed to make an entry in, I had lost my interest in writing or planning another today. I just wasn&#x2019;t organized enough each day, everyday to keep myself, well, organized.</p> <p>However, I love, <em>love</em> updating my <em>personal</em> bullet journal daily. I believe the analog method of doing so is one big reason behind the change. Thoughts flow freely through the pen on to the paper&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;a lot more so than they do digitally. There is something about the legibility (illegibility, to be fair) of the <strong>handwritten words</strong> that lowers some mental hurdles.

It has been an enlightening month - I have learned so much about my habits and the way my mind works.</p> <p>Of course, this wasn&#x2019;t my first attempt at maintaining a journal or of planning myself, my life through an organizer. There have been many <em>failed</em> new year resolutions that have led to me buying, keeping and planning my days and months in the traditional journals - ones with days, months written on every page. With every day that I had failed to make an entry in, I had lost my interest in writing or planning another today. I just wasn&#x2019;t organized enough each day, everyday to keep myself, well, organized.</p> <p>However, I love, <em>love</em> updating my <em>personal</em> bullet journal daily. I believe the analog method of doing so is one big reason behind the change. Thoughts flow freely through the pen on to the paper&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;a lot more so than they do digitally.

I observe this behavior very often and every single time, I am left completely befuddled. Why would you not read what permission the app is asking for and why would you not question why it needs that?</p> <p>For me, no app gets any permission the first time it asks for it. Everything is disabled by default. Especially the access to my location, microphone or camera. <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/purge-undeserving-notifications\">None</a>. You need to convince me to the core <em>at the right moment</em> that you deserve this privilege. I prefer veering towards extreme stringency of access to my device.</p> <p>As more and more connected, data-hungry devices surround us, it is becoming important to instill awareness amongst the populace of the fallouts minor negligence while using these devices can lead to. Not provoke moral panic, but train to be cognizant towards one&#x2019;s privacy and security. If we ourselves don&#x2019;t put price on our data, we have no right to expect the organizations to lend respect to something that is a primary and sole fuel to their profits.</p>\n",

When Eisen visited the book&#x2019;s Amazon page several days in a row, he discovered that the prices were increasing continually, in a regular pattern. Seller A&#x2019;s price was consistently 99.83 per cent that of Seller B; Seller B&#x2019;s price was reset, every day, to 127.059 per cent of Seller A&#x2019;s. Eisen surmised that Seller A had a copy of the book, and was seeking to undercut the next-cheapest price.

I think they&#x2019;re tedious and samey and sedative, and when I&#x2019;m feeling especially cranky, I consider them an enemy of music. Most podcasts are conversations for people to eavesdrop on &#x2014; recorded talk that precludes real-life talk about real life with zombie talk about podcasts. Also, I like music. With all of the world&#x2019;s unheard songs beckoning us with their endless mystery, why would anyone choose to waste their precious listening hours on a podcast?</p> </blockquote> <p>Yeah, the topic is a pretty polarizing one. Most vocal voices on online forums may not agree with the Chris&#x2019;s perspective. I myself believe this medium of entertainment or<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>infotainment&#x201D; needs some control to make it useful.

I think they&#x2019;re tedious and samey and sedative, and when I&#x2019;m feeling especially cranky, I consider them an enemy of music. Most podcasts are conversations for people to eavesdrop on &#x2014; recorded talk that precludes real-life talk about real life with zombie talk about podcasts. Also, I like music. With all of the world&#x2019;s unheard songs beckoning us with their endless mystery, why would anyone choose to waste their precious listening hours on a podcast?</p> </blockquote> <p>Yeah, the topic is a pretty polarizing one.

Nice. And this positive view towards the <span class=\"small-caps\">P30</span> camera is shared by almost all tech reviewers.

It isn&#x2019;t even the hands-down best camera quality and experience on a mobile phone.

I am left frustrated every time by this sheer defeatism, this complete lack of attempt to try earnestly to understand and comment on the alternatives. What all alternatives have you tried? Were there none that were good? If so, why? What is missing? How can they be made better? What is it that you are looking for in a social network?</p> <p>Mike Elgan had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufr7O0qtX9U&amp;t=3251s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this comment</a> on the recent episode of TWiG.</p> <blockquote> <p>I would love a social network that had basically two rules. One is no algorithmic sorting or filtering, when I follow somebody I want everything they post. Second thing is I don&#x2019;t want to get any content that isn&#x2019;t the actual words or photos taken my the person I follow. No sharing, no retweeting.</p> </blockquote> <p>I thought great, <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I know of one</a> that meets these two rules. May be they will recommend it. Or comment on why it is lacking. Nah. Nothing. The topic ended there. I am perplexed at why Micro.blog isn&#x2019;t referenced more often during these discussions on social networks. Sure, it may not be perfect. So go ahead, criticize it. Tell the makers of the service why they can&#x2019;t use it. But do talk.</p> <p>And micro.blog isn&#x2019;t the only one. There&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mastodon</a>. And then there are the independent blogging solutions and <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span>. Generate some buzz for them. You are not helping the situation by cribbing incessantly about the unending missteps of the existing services. Put these same old rants to rest now and crib about the new services. At least, the normal users would know there exist other alternatives and the developers would know what they need to work on.</p>\n",

I am left frustrated every time by this sheer defeatism, this complete lack of attempt to try earnestly to understand and comment on the alternatives. What all alternatives have you tried? Were there none that were good? If so, why? What is missing? How can they be made better? What is it that you are looking for in a social network?</p> <p>Mike Elgan had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufr7O0qtX9U&amp;t=3251s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this comment</a> on the recent episode of TWiG.</p> <blockquote> <p>I would love a social network that had basically two rules. One is no algorithmic sorting or filtering, when I follow somebody I want everything they post. Second thing is I don&#x2019;t want to get any content that isn&#x2019;t the actual words or photos taken my the person I follow. No sharing, no retweeting.</p> </blockquote> <p>I thought great, <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I know of one</a> that meets these two rules. May be they will recommend it. Or comment on why it is lacking. Nah. Nothing. The topic ended there. I am perplexed at why Micro.blog isn&#x2019;t referenced more often during these discussions on social networks. Sure, it may not be perfect. So go ahead, criticize it. Tell the makers of the service why they can&#x2019;t use it. But do talk.</p> <p>And micro.blog isn&#x2019;t the only one. There&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mastodon</a>. And then there are the independent blogging solutions and <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span>. Generate some buzz for them. You are not helping the situation by cribbing incessantly about the unending missteps of the existing services. Put these same old rants to rest now and crib about the new services. At least, the normal users would know there exist other alternatives and the developers would know what they need to work on.</p>\n",

				"title": "Adding On This Day feature to Blot",
				"content_html": "<p>Recently David Merfield, the developer behind Blot, documented the steps to expose a <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed on a Blot site. I <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/on-this-day-a-year-ago\">have been running a <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed</a> for my blog for quite some time now, with some valuable help from David of course. It is this feed that drives the <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/on-this-day\">On This Day</a> page on this blog. I thought I will share my approach so that others with a blog running on Blot can create such a page.</p> <p>To begin with, follow <a href=\"https://blot.im/developers/guides/json-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the guide</a> to get a working <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed for your blog. Validate you have a properly formed and accessible feed being served using the <a href=\"http://validator.jsonfeed.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed validator</a>.</p> <div class=\"note\"> One key thing to understand here is how to create a view in Blot. It would be important to be aware of this step to proceed further. A view can be created in Blot by accessing the <a href=\"https://blot.im/settings/theme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">editing template</a> section (<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Template</strong>) in Blot dashboard. Click on <strong>Edit</strong> against your currently installed theme and search for an option<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span><strong>Create new view</strong><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span>. </div> <p>Once the <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed is available, create a view in Blot for a javascript file. Copy the complete content of the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/am1t/5bcbc5366491c2b010adfe1358877899\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">javascript available as a gist</a><span class=\"marker\">*</span> and add them to this new view. Modify the <code>json_feed_url</code> and <code>tz</code> variables appropriately to reflect the <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span> for the <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed and the timezone for your blog, you can refer to the formats in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"small-caps\">TZ</span> database time zones</a>. This script does the following.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li><strong>Fetches</strong> all the posts as <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> objects from the <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed</li> <li><strong>Identifies</strong> the posts that share the same date and month as the current date (but not the year to avoid loading today&#x2019;s posts)</li> <li><strong>Renders</strong> the posts (or <em>no posts</em> message) in the predefined section detailed below. This also includes some styling via the <code>.className</code> definition, you can remove/modify that as per your liking in fuction <code>renderPost</code>.</li> </ol> <p><underline>Make sure the above created view is accessible at a <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span>.</underline> If not, define a route in the <strong>Settings</strong> section of the view.</p> <p>Next, create another view for a page to display these posts; a reference html page is available <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/am1t/472499285986345f34c61274edd22cdc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">as a gist</a>. Modify the <code>src</code> in <code>&lt;script src=&quot;/flashback.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> to reflects the <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span> for the javascript created above. The script adds and renders the posts made on this day in earlier years in the <code>div</code> element with <code>id</code> <code>on-this-day</code>.</p> <p>Do give this a try, it is fascinating to see your thoughts change, or at times stay exactly the same, over the year. Reach out to me if you face any issues or find any step missing.</p> <div class=\"note\"> <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Expose a <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed on your site. Create two views in Blot using the gist <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/am1t/5bcbc5366491c2b010adfe1358877899\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">flashback.js</a> and <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/am1t/472499285986345f34c61274edd22cdc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on-this-day.html</a>. You should have two additional pages, you can use the same file names. If you do, you can access your On This Day page at <code>/on-this-day</code>. </div> <hr /> <p><small><span class=\"marker\">*</span> This javascript is inspired by and based on the wonderful project <a href=\"https://github.com/cleverdevil/micromemories\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Micro Memories</a> by <a href=\"https://cleverdevil.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jonathan LaCour</a> for the micro.blog hosted blogs.

Validate you have a properly formed and accessible feed being served using the <a href=\"http://validator.jsonfeed.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed validator</a>.</p> <div class=\"note\"> One key thing to understand here is how to create a view in Blot. It would be important to be aware of this step to proceed further. A view can be created in Blot by accessing the <a href=\"https://blot.im/settings/theme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">editing template</a> section (<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Template</strong>) in Blot dashboard. Click on <strong>Edit</strong> against your currently installed theme and search for an option<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span><strong>Create new view</strong><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span>. </div> <p>Once the <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed is available, create a view in Blot for a javascript file. Copy the complete content of the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/am1t/5bcbc5366491c2b010adfe1358877899\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">javascript available as a gist</a><span class=\"marker\">*</span> and add them to this new view. Modify the <code>json_feed_url</code> and <code>tz</code> variables appropriately to reflect the <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span> for the <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed and the timezone for your blog, you can refer to the formats in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"small-caps\">TZ</span> database time zones</a>. This script does the following.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li><strong>Fetches</strong> all the posts as <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> objects from the <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed</li> <li><strong>Identifies</strong> the posts that share the same date and month as the current date (but not the year to avoid loading today&#x2019;s posts)</li> <li><strong>Renders</strong> the posts (or <em>no posts</em> message) in the predefined section detailed below. This also includes some styling via the <code>.className</code> definition, you can remove/modify that as per your liking in fuction <code>renderPost</code>.</li> </ol> <p><underline>Make sure the above created view is accessible at a <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span>.</underline> If not, define a route in the <strong>Settings</strong> section of the view.</p> <p>Next, create another view for a page to display these posts; a reference html page is available <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/am1t/472499285986345f34c61274edd22cdc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">as a gist</a>. Modify the <code>src</code> in <code>&lt;script src=&quot;/flashback.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> to reflects the <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span> for the javascript created above. The script adds and renders the posts made on this day in earlier years in the <code>div</code> element with <code>id</code> <code>on-this-day</code>.</p> <p>Do give this a try, it is fascinating to see your thoughts change, or at times stay exactly the same, over the year. Reach out to me if you face any issues or find any step missing.</p> <div class=\"note\"> <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Expose a <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span> feed on your site. Create two views in Blot using the gist <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/am1t/5bcbc5366491c2b010adfe1358877899\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">flashback.js</a> and <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/am1t/472499285986345f34c61274edd22cdc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on-this-day.html</a>. You should have two additional pages, you can use the same file names. If you do, you can access your On This Day page at <code>/on-this-day</code>. </div> <hr /> <p><small><span class=\"marker\">*</span> This javascript is inspired by and based on the wonderful project <a href=\"https://github.com/cleverdevil/micromemories\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Micro Memories</a> by <a href=\"https://cleverdevil.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jonathan LaCour</a> for the micro.blog hosted blogs. I have customized and simplified it as per my needs.</small></p>\n",

It is a biopic of a person that I adore, an iconic Marathi writer and a humorist, a brilliant theater artist and an adept musician, a person who inspired me to start writing. That person is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purushottam_Laxman_Deshpande\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Purushottam Laxman Deshpande</a>, lovingly called<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Pu. La.&#x201D; or<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Bhai&#x201D; in the region I am from.</p> <p>Narrating the life of this towering personality is not a small feat given the sheer number of stream of art he was passionate about. He is a well-known and a well-respected person amongst Maharashtrians of all age. It is through his writing, through the careful study of human nature around him that he taught many what the real happiness is. So it is only just that I was so curious to learn more about this master, through especially the first of this two-part biopic that focuses on his early life.</p> <p>It was wonderful to know more about this simple person and was refreshing to see the Maharashtra of early 1900. In a way, I thought the people, the society that Bhai dwelt in was a lot more liberal, more open than what we see today. It was pleasing to watch the strong women with definite opinions, the simple marriage or even the relationship that Bhai&#x2019;s wife and his mother share. The finale with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWXbwSUxOW0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a mind-blowing rendition of Hindustani classical music</a> through a couple of well-known songs was sheer magic on screen - left me with goose bumps down my arms. It is Marathi culture on display. It instantly transported me back to my childhood days when these songs were our morning alarms. Boy, how much do I yearn for the simple life of yesteryears?</p> <p>No doubt then that it was a brilliant watch for me, and my family. Even my friends share my experience. But all of us already know a lot about the person and the people around him. The list of characters, from the real-life like Bhimsen Joshi or Kumar Gandarva and from Bhai&#x2019;s imagination like Anna or Namu Parit, that walk the screen are well itched in us Marathi people&#x2019;s memories. But that may not be the case for people not from this state.</p> <p>I wish this movie was an equally well-made biography, not just a celebration of the life of this beloved man. I wish the characters were allowed to grow, introduced at the very least. I wish we learned more about the relationship Bhai shared with these characters. I wish this could have been that one movie I would recommend every friend of mine to watch so that they knew what gem of a person Pu. La. was. But, alas.</p> <p>First thing I did once I was back from the theater was to listen to couple of Pu. La.&#x2019;s story-telling acts. It was heart-warming for me to see many aged couples who could barely walk taking all the effort to come down to the theater with their family and laughing their hearts out. May be they had spent their golden years together watching Bhai live and now they want to re-live those days. So yes, the movie did leave many, including me, nostalgic. May be that was the win the makers were going for.</p>\n",

Your past self is your best indicator of how you actually felt in similar situations. So it helps to have an accurate picture of your past.</p> </blockquote> <p>It was especially fascinating looking at the list of topics he keeps a journal about. A great, great inspiration for any one looking out for what to journal about. He puts down a prime example.</p> <blockquote> <p>I especially like my<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Regrets&#x201D; journal. Whenever I do something I regret, I write it down there, noting why I regret it, what I wish I would have done instead, and how I hope to prevent this in the future.</p> </blockquote> <p>Derek has given me so much to ponder on.

It&#x2019;s a must read (and while you are there, may be you should also subscribe to his wonderful blog). His post inspired me to <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/tagged/retrospection\">#retrospect</a> on how the last decade has been for me.</p> <p>I hit my archives right away to see what I was thinking about, was writing about a decade ago. I was in my early to mid twenties then and I had a guess I was busy being a crazy teen. I noticed I was writing my heart out, not thinking too seriously about anything. I wrote very poorly, but at the same time, freely. The immaturity in my thoughts and in my reading of the events around is pretty apparent in the posts.</p> <p>However, I also came across <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/archive/what-is-ambition/\">this post about ambitions</a> that I wrote in January of 2009. This observation of mine caught my attention (I couldn&#x2019;t stop myself from fixing the prose to some extent).</p> <blockquote> <p>If an ardent desire is what an ambition is all about, then yes, I must have had hundreds of ambitions by now. And the list has possibly grown to a thousands now with passing age. With each ambition I achieve, I have added a few more in the list. I know and still remember the whole gyan that a life lived without an ambition is like an arrow fired without an aim. But practically speaking, I feel it is impossible to lay the path for one&#x2019;s whole life right at his or her birth.</p> </blockquote> <p>It doesn&#x2019;t matter how immature I sounded in most of the posts, one thing I appreciate about the decade-younger me was how free he was. He had a lot more to say and often said it in a manner that even the older, supposedly more mature me can&#x2019;t disagree with.</p> <p>I have held a lot of ardent desires, ambitions - some that have been fulfilled, many that haven&#x2019;t been yet. But deep within, I had hoped that I will someday live a calm, peaceful life. Live amongst my loved ones. Gain respect in society, among colleagues, friends and acquaintances.</p> <p>As I reflect today on an important decade gone by, I realize I have managed to work towards that ambition through many tricky, life-altering decisions. I am closer to my loved ones than I was a decade ago. I have married the love of my life. We are blessed with a lovely daughter who has become the center of our universe. Professionally, I have better clarity on where I want to be. I have found a circle of friends I can rely on during times of stress.</p> <p>Sure the world around looks to be in shambles. There&#x2019;s a definite lack of trust for the democratic structures, lack of trust between one another. The past few years have heightened the noise in our lives. No wonder then, people are losing faith. So it is tempting to give up to the pessimism around and stay grumpy.</p> <p>But I also realized it was healthier to reflect inwards and seek optimism by working on things I can control. So, the fidgety teen from 10 years back has given way to the calmer, saner, thoughtful self of today. I feel content within and that is the most important thing.</p> <p>Satisfaction.

The lineup from its competitors doesn&#x2019;t allow them and their users to justify their crazy costs. They need a cheaper, better alternative to compete.

It could potentially limit the audience, especially one that interacts, to the developer niche that understands IndieWeb. But I was pleased that wasn&#x2019;t the case. More on <em>why</em> later, first a quick comment on comments.</p> <p>I am not alone who is fed up of the commenting systems. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dave Winer</a> has since long turned off the responses on his posts. And in recent times he also has been particularly <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/08/02/141534.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unhappy with Disqus</a>, his selected replacement to the in-built responses. So, he <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/12/31/155551.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">found out his way</a> to enable a commenting mechanism that did not need constant managing. Plus at the same time, had an entry barrier of sorts.

You can follow tweets <em>on Twitter</em> - they are closer to post <em>on Twitter</em>. And Dave publishes <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> feed of all the comments. So he, and the readers, can receive all the comments.</p> <p>For me personally though, this does not meet the one main criteria - it keeps the responses away from the posts, hence from the context. And inadvertently from the readers too. There&#x2019;s no way then to inspire any inclination amongst readers to contribute and be part of an ongoing conversation on the post.</p> <p>So, back to webmentions. I can display mentions along with my post (and with <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/display-webmentions/\">this recent guide</a> I had written, you can too) and that means any reader at my blog is aware of the sort of discussion that&#x2019;s taking place over the post. If you see my recent posts, they have significant interactions between multiple people.</p> <p>But where is this discussion taking place? And how can one be part of it? It&#x2019;s primarily all happening on <a href=\"https://micro.blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">micro.blog</a>. The platform fosters a pleasant community of many creative and open minds. It also encourages meaningful conversations over mindless reactions. And Manton, the mind behind Micro.blog, is a <a href=\"https://manton.org/2018/09/07/the-way-out.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">firm proponent of the open web</a>.</p> <p>I wish more people become part of the platform - better, support the platform by subscribing to the paid plans.

I am not alone when I say this, but am mighty impressed with how simple it is to post things on blot and maintain the overall site. They are just some files in Dropbox - that&#x2019;s about it. So, it was pretty straightforward to <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/theme-refresh\">customise the theme</a> to my liking and to <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/indiewebify-blot-site\">enable the support for IndieWeb principles</a>.</p> <p><img src=\"uploads/2020/427a86b0a6.jpg\" alt=\"Post Notes\"></p> <p>One thing I have noticed, though, is that most of the IndieWeb principles are not visible.

I did not go into the details of setting up webmentions. And that is exactly what I get asked the most about - how does one display mentions along with the posts.</p> <p>The need is more evident with microblogging - and especially so with <a href=\"https://micro.blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">micro.blog</a>. The platform fosters a very active and pleasant community focused more on the interactions (replies) than meaningless reactions (likes, reposts). It also sends webmentions for every reply to a post to the sites that can receive them. So the desire to display the interactions along with the posts, microposts more so, is understandable.</p> <p>In this post, I will (finally!) document the steps that can help one receive, fetch and display the webmentions along with the posts. The steps are documented from a reference of a blot website. However, the steps below can be altered at appropriate places, primarily formats, to implement the support for any other platform.</p> <h2 id=\"essential-indieweb\">Essential Indieweb</h2> <p>Before you can start receiving the webmentions at your site, there is an essential step from IndieWeb to be achieved - to make your website your identity online. It involves declaring openly your social network profiles as <code>rel-me</code> links and link those profiles back to your site. This allows you to login to any IndieAuth enabled services using your website&#x2019;s homepage - no need to create an account or maintain passwords.</p> <p>To achieve this, modify the <code>head.html</code> of the site&#x2019;s theme to add such links to your other online profiles in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element. These profiles can be at Twitter, Github, Facebook, or even email - anything where you can link back to your website from. Some reference links are shown below.</p> <pre><code class=\"hljs html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">link</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">rel</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;me&quot;</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;https://twitter.com/abcxyz&quot;</span> /&gt;</span> <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">link</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">rel</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;me&quot;</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;http://github.com/abcxyz&quot;</span> /&gt;</span> <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">link</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">rel</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;me&quot;</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;mailto:abcxyz@example.com&quot;</span> /&gt;</span></code></pre> <p>After you declare your website with either Twitter or Github, they can authenticate your identity. With email, a link is sent to the configured email address to do the same, very much like any email-based two-factor authentication.</p> <p>You also need to declare the service which will act as an authorization endpoint when needed. This is used by other services, mostly IndieAuth clients, to validate your identity. To configure this, just add the below link to your site&#x2019;s <code>head</code>.</p> <pre><code class=\"hljs html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">link</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">rel</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;authorization_endpoint&quot;</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;https://indieauth.com/auth&quot;</span>&gt;</span></code></pre> <p>Once you have this enabled, you can test your setup using <a href=\"https://indiewebify.me\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Indiewebify.Me</a>. Test the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Set up Web Sign In&#x201D; section.</p> <p>You are now ready to receive the webmentions from other sites, including Micro.blog.</p> <h2 id=\"receive-webmentions\">Receive Webmentions</h2> <p>This primarily involves hosting and declaring a webmention endpoint. Of course, the active IndieWeb community already has a ready solution for this - <a href=\"https://webmention.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">webmention.io</a> by <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aaron Parecki</a>. It is<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>a hosted service created to easily handle webmentions&#x201D;. All you have to do is sign-in with your domain (i.e.&#xA0;validate your identity) and let Webmention.io receive all mentions to your site. Once that&#x2019;s done, just declare the webmention endpoint as below in your site&#x2019;s <code>head</code>.</p> <pre><code class=\"hljs html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">link</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">rel</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;webmention&quot;</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;https://webmention.io/username/webmention&quot;</span> /&gt;</span></code></pre> <p>The <code>username</code> is typically the url of your site (you can also find these details on the <a href=\"https://webmention.io/settings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">settings</a> page). To test this setup, login to <a href=\"https://webmention.io/dashboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">webmentions.io dashboard</a> and you should start seeing the mentions sent to your site (which includes the replies on Micro.blog.</p> <h2 id=\"display-webmentions\">Display Webmentions</h2> <p>Webmention.io also <a href=\"https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io#api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">provides APIs</a> for you to fetch the webmentions to your posts/site. You can implement a custom solution using Javascript for fetching and displaying these mentions along with posts. Below is one of the ways this can be achieved. It specifically pulls the likes, reposts and replies and puts them below the posts. The code might look a bit untidy, but it would be easier to follow what&#x2019;s going on. You can improve over this eventually.</p> <p>To start with, declare a placeholder for the webmentions. Place the below <code>div</code> element in your <code>entry.html</code> file between <code>{{#entry}}</code> and <code>{{/entry}}</code> - preferably towards the end of the file, just above <code>{{/entry}}</code>.</p> <pre><code class=\"hljs html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;post-mentions&quot;</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">id</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;post-mentions&quot;</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">style</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;display:none&quot;</span>&gt;</span> <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">ul</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;mentions-list&quot;</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">id</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;mentions-list&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">ul</span>&gt;</span> <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">d\niv</span>&gt;</span></code></pre> <p>Of course, you could replace the unordered list <code>ul</code> element with anything else. This is just one of the ways you can do it.</p> <p>Next, you need to fill this <code>div</code> element with the mentions the entry has received. You can use the javascript snippet available at <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/am1t/7295b4eaf101372ea71c877cfd8be694\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this gist</a> to fetch and display the webmentions along with the post. Just place the complete code available there at the end of <code>script.js</code> file of your blot&#x2019;s theme. So it would look something like below (note that this is an incomplete snapshot).</p> <pre><code class=\"hljs js\">{{{appJS}}} <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> post_url = <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">window</span>.location.href; $(<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">document</span>).ready(<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\"></span>)</span>{ $(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;ul#mentions-list&quot;</span>).empty(); $.getJSON(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;https://webmention.io/api/mentions?jsonp=?&quot;</span>, { <span class=\"hljs-attr\">target</span>: post_url }, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">data</span>)</span>{ ... ... </code></pre> <p><em>Make sure the first <code>{{{appJS}}}</code> line is not removed.

This allows you to control the style of the elements as per your liking. Just modify the main css file for your theme (typically <code>style.css</code>) to add styling for these classes.</p> <p>For reference, find below a sample styling for the main <code>post-mention</code> class.</p> <pre><code class=\"hljs css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.post-mentions</span> { <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">padding-top</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">15px</span>; <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">margin-top</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">10px</span>; <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">border-top</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">1px</span> solid <span class=\"hljs-number\">#AEADAD</span>; <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">border-bottom</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">1px</span> solid <span class=\"hljs-number\">#AEADAD</span>; <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">font-size</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">16px</span>; } <span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.post-mentions</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">ul</span> { <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">list-style</span>:none; <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">padding</span>:<span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>; <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">margin-left</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>; }</code></pre> <p>Similarly, you can also style the <code>mention</code>, <code>mention-author</code>, <code>mention-social</code> and <code>mention-text</code> classes.</p> <h2 id=\"interactions-from-social-media\">Interactions from Social Media</h2> <p>Though references to your posts from IndieWeb sites are handled, what about the references made on Twitter or Facebook? It can be in any form of response (i.e.&#xA0;likes/retweets/reposts) to the syndicated post. Of course, they do not send webmentions (wish they did).</p> <p>One option is to implement your own <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/backfeed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">backfeed</a> to poll for such interactions and handle them as response. Well, the community has made sure there is a simpler hosted option. Enter <a href=\"https://brid.gy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bridgy</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Bridgy is an open source project and proxy that implements backfeed and <span class=\"small-caps\">POSSE</span> as a service. Bridgy sends webmentions for comments, likes, etc. on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, and Flickr.</p> </blockquote> <p>Just connect your social accounts with your website at Bridgy and every time there is an interaction about your post on a service, Bridgy captures that and sends a webmention to your endpoint configured earlier.</p> <hr /> <p>I understand that the IndieWeb journey can get overwhelming. Webmentions are a critical part of this journey and, as I said earlier, one of the more prominent pieces of the overall puzzle. I have never been comfortable using any of the commenting systems, be it those that come native with the CMSes or external commenting systems like Disqus. I have also observed that the new platforms, like Blot or Micro.blog, rarely come bundled with commenting systems of their own.</p> <p>Webmention has a potential to address that need. I hope the steps detailed above come in handy for anyone who wants to display webmentions on his or her site right next to the posts. The source for the theme that styles <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/\">my blog</a> at Blot is <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/blot-musings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">openly available at GitHub</a>. So, if you like anything that you see at my blog, you can refer to the source and get inspired.</p> <p>Do let me know if you face issues with getting any of steps carried out. If you don&#x2019;t face any issue and get everything working perfectly, send me a webmention&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;the best way would be to link to this post. If all&#x2019;s well, your links would be visible below this post as mentions.</p>\n",

Bridgy sends webmentions for comments, likes, etc. on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, and Flickr.</p> </blockquote> <p>Just connect your social accounts with your website at Bridgy and every time there is an interaction about your post on a service, Bridgy captures that and sends a webmention to your endpoint configured earlier.</p> <hr /> <p>I understand that the IndieWeb journey can get overwhelming. Webmentions are a critical part of this journey and, as I said earlier, one of the more prominent pieces of the overall puzzle. I have never been comfortable using any of the commenting systems, be it those that come native with the CMSes or external commenting systems like Disqus. I have also observed that the new platforms, like Blot or Micro.blog, rarely come bundled with commenting systems of their own.</p> <p>Webmention has a potential to address that need. I hope the steps detailed above come in handy for anyone who wants to display webmentions on his or her site right next to the posts. The source for the theme that styles <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/\">my blog</a> at Blot is <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/blot-musings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">openly available at GitHub</a>. So, if you like anything that you see at my blog, you can refer to the source and get inspired.</p> <p>Do let me know if you face issues with getting any of steps carried out. If you don&#x2019;t face any issue and get everything working perfectly, send me a webmention&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;the best way would be to link to this post. If all&#x2019;s well, your links would be visible below this post as mentions.</p>\n",

Technology has changed the world in the blink of an eye, leaving us no time to reflect on it. What if a month without modern technology could<span class=\"push-single\"></span> <span class=\"pull-single\">&#x2018;</span>travel&#x2019; you to the past? What if there is a way you could compare your technology-relying self to what you once were?</p> </blockquote> <p>It is really curious to read how the analogue tools &#x2014; for his camera, his watch, a map, a compass and of course a notepad and a pen - were key in taking him through. Of course, it needs planning to keep your brain busy without a stream of digital updates and reads to chomp on. To keep feeding it with activities.</p> <blockquote> <p>Boredom was the thing that scared me the most, so I did a lot of preparation: took a few thick books, drew up a schedule (when I leave one place for another) and made up several evening rituals to follow every day. The internet-less reality turned out to be a boredom-less one, too. Recreation does not require anything special&#x2014;in the end, you can always go out and hunt for good photos.</p> </blockquote> <p>I wish I could undertake such an abstinence from the technology around me. Not because I hate my current state (doesn&#x2019;t mean I do not even). But because I wish I too could arrive at a conclusion very similar to Andrey&#x2019;s.</p> <blockquote> <p>I came to the conclusion that <span class=\"small-caps\">IT</span> hadn&#x2019;t changed the world around, but created another, a parallel one. The reason we are always nervous and never have enough time is that we are living two lives now. It&#x2019;s without a doubt difficult, yet how interesting it is to be living two times as much!</p> </blockquote> <p>Do read this &#x2014; even though we know most deep down the ills of our constant connectedness, it is eye-opening to read someone record his experiences. If possible, we should take Andrey&#x2019;s advice. I, for sure, am seriously considering it.</p> <blockquote> <p>I would not recommend digital fasting to everyone, but a temporary abstinence of some sort seems a very right thing to do</p> </blockquote></p>\n",

Of course, it needs planning to keep your brain busy without a stream of digital updates and reads to chomp on. To keep feeding it with activities.</p> <blockquote> <p>Boredom was the thing that scared me the most, so I did a lot of preparation: took a few thick books, drew up a schedule (when I leave one place for another) and made up several evening rituals to follow every day. The internet-less reality turned out to be a boredom-less one, too. Recreation does not require anything special&#x2014;in the end, you can always go out and hunt for good photos.</p> </blockquote> <p>I wish I could undertake such an abstinence from the technology around me. Not because I hate my current state (doesn&#x2019;t mean I do not even). But because I wish I too could arrive at a conclusion very similar to Andrey&#x2019;s.</p> <blockquote> <p>I came to the conclusion that <span class=\"small-caps\">IT</span> hadn&#x2019;t changed the world around, but created another, a parallel one. The reason we are always nervous and never have enough time is that we are living two lives now. It&#x2019;s without a doubt difficult, yet how interesting it is to be living two times as much!</p> </blockquote> <p>Do read this &#x2014; even though we know most deep down the ills of our constant connectedness, it is eye-opening to read someone record his experiences. If possible, we should take Andrey&#x2019;s advice. I, for sure, am seriously considering it.</p> <blockquote> <p>I would not recommend digital fasting to everyone, but a temporary abstinence of some sort seems a very right thing to do</p> </blockquote>\n",

The useless news, whose whole purpose is to satisfy the need for the news website or <span class=\"small-caps\">TV</span> channels to keep<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>reporting&#x201D; something, anything new, get filtered out by the editors. After all, there is a limited pace to fill in the pages on the printed paper.</p> <p>So I am no longer bludgeoned with a constant stream of everything that&#x2019;s negative. With that, I think there is a lot less crap in the world than I was made to believe.</p> <p>Is it bad out there? Sure. But at least I ain&#x2019;t bogged down by the insignificant drivel that the world is full of.</p>\n",

When they can move their trackers (and eventually ads) right to the tool that people access the internet with, they would know what everyone&#x2019;s doing on the internet. But Google should not be allowed to get away by dumping the idea down its user&#x2019;s throat. Sure, normal people may not be able to differentiate how logging in to a service and to Chrome is different. Or how login/session cookies for Google may screw up the security model on a shared computer.</p> <p>But that exactly is the reason why people who understand better need to voice their disapproval. It is easy to say that it&#x2019;s not a big deal as I am already better informed to not use Chrome. But it is also reckless&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;Chrome has already become a de facto browser for mainstream users. It&#x2019;s a wrong precedent then to let people who cannot fully grasp (or aren&#x2019;t inclined to out of sheer neglect) the basic underpinnings of the open web to drive what&#x2019;s acceptable for a browser, and on the web. If that was allowed, Net neutrality would already have been a lost battle worldwide. Such decisions tend to be uninformed and harm the community in the longer run.</p> <p>An internet service is a different entity, it serves a specific purpose. It solves a specific problem that an end user has. Gmail is an email client. YouTube is a video sharing service. Google Search is&#x2026; well, it has long since stopped being just a search engine. But, one gets the idea. You access a <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span> and it brings you to the service.</p> <p>Chrome is not that. Chrome is a tool that allows users access these different services. And it is better if it stays that way. It&#x2019;s already bad that all browsers come with an incognito mode by default. It would be important that we do not introduce another mode just to go incognito from the owners of the browsers.</p> <p>I am sure B&#xE1;lint will agree and his final thought kind of sums it well.</p> <blockquote> <p>Part of me feels that this Chrome shared computer issue that Googlers mentioned is real, but it&#x2019;s also just too convenient to solve this by tieing Chrome closer to Google, you know?</p> </blockquote></p>\n",

Or how login/session cookies for Google may screw up the security model on a shared computer.</p> <p>But that exactly is the reason why people who understand better need to voice their disapproval. It is easy to say that it&#x2019;s not a big deal as I am already better informed to not use Chrome. But it is also reckless&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;Chrome has already become a de facto browser for mainstream users. It&#x2019;s a wrong precedent then to let people who cannot fully grasp (or aren&#x2019;t inclined to out of sheer neglect) the basic underpinnings of the open web to drive what&#x2019;s acceptable for a browser, and on the web. If that was allowed, Net neutrality would already have been a lost battle worldwide. Such decisions tend to be uninformed and harm the community in the longer run.</p> <p>An internet service is a different entity, it serves a specific purpose. It solves a specific problem that an end user has. Gmail is an email client. YouTube is a video sharing service. Google Search is&#x2026; well, it has long since stopped being just a search engine. But, one gets the idea. You access a <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span> and it brings you to the service.</p> <p>Chrome is not that. Chrome is a tool that allows users access these different services. And it is better if it stays that way. It&#x2019;s already bad that all browsers come with an incognito mode by default. It would be important that we do not introduce another mode just to go incognito from the owners of the browsers.</p> <p>I am sure B&#xE1;lint will agree and his final thought kind of sums it well.</p> <blockquote> <p>Part of me feels that this Chrome shared computer issue that Googlers mentioned is real, but it&#x2019;s also just too convenient to solve this by tieing Chrome closer to Google, you know?</p> </blockquote>\n",

It also is an exercise so that I keep track of all the articles I havr read and liked over the years. However, sharing them instantly was polluting the feed. I wouldn&#x2019;t want to see that from others in my timeline. So it was only fair for me to not do the same.</p> <p>Hence, going ahead I plan to share a list of articles I liked through the day as a list. This is the first edition of the post.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>Dave Winer <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/08/09.html#a182256\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">feels</a> may be it&#x2019;s a good thing that Twitter hasn&#x2019;t banned Alex Jones yet. And he is unhappy with the journalists for bashing Twitter incessantly for that.</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Their unwillingness to follow the herd is a sign of hope that we may continue to use the net to speak freely, even if the majority wants us silenced. And what does it say about journalism that there are few if any dissenters? You see this regularly, they&#x2019;re too scared for some reason to present all sides of a discussion.&#x201D;</p> </blockquote> <ol start=\"2\" type=\"1\"> <li>Rebecca Cook <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/the-most-powerful-publishers-in-the-world-dont-give-a-damn/567095/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">disagrees</a> with Dave completely. And she shares one of the heartfelt experiences she had during <em>a community she visited, on December 15, 2012</em> to back why.</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p>And any media executive who can&#x2019;t see the harm in protecting the publishing power of a person who denies what&#x2019;s real with such utter cruelty and disregard for the pain of his fellow citizens should be asked to explain himself. And then to explain again. What do you really believe in?</p> </blockquote> <ol start=\"3\" type=\"1\"> <li>Matt Levine <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-08-08/elon-musk-has-some-fun-with-tesla\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">summarises</a> Elon Musk&#x2019;s latest stunt, attempting to take Tesla private. And does so perfectly.</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p>Musk amusingly named his promotional flamethrowers<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Not a Flamethrower&#x201D; to get around shipping rules banning flamethrowers, and he seems to have learned the wrong lesson from that stunt. I suspect that naming his public company<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Not a Public Company&#x201D; won&#x2019;t actually work to get around securities laws.</p> </blockquote> <ol start=\"4\" type=\"1\"> <li>The world of technology and science never fails to fascinate me.

It also is an exercise so that I keep track of all the articles I havr read and liked over the years. However, sharing them instantly was polluting the feed. I wouldn&#x2019;t want to see that from others in my timeline. So it was only fair for me to not do the same.</p> <p>Hence, going ahead I plan to share a list of articles I liked through the day as a list.

And he is unhappy with the journalists for bashing Twitter incessantly for that.</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Their unwillingness to follow the herd is a sign of hope that we may continue to use the net to speak freely, even if the majority wants us silenced. And what does it say about journalism that there are few if any dissenters? You see this regularly, they&#x2019;re too scared for some reason to present all sides of a discussion.&#x201D;</p> </blockquote> <ol start=\"2\" type=\"1\"> <li>Rebecca Cook <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/the-most-powerful-publishers-in-the-world-dont-give-a-damn/567095/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">disagrees</a> with Dave completely. And she shares one of the heartfelt experiences she had during <em>a community she visited, on December 15, 2012</em> to back why.</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p>And any media executive who can&#x2019;t see the harm in protecting the publishing power of a person who denies what&#x2019;s real with such utter cruelty and disregard for the pain of his fellow citizens should be asked to explain himself. And then to explain again. What do you really believe in?</p> </blockquote> <ol start=\"3\" type=\"1\"> <li>Matt Levine <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-08-08/elon-musk-has-some-fun-with-tesla\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">summarises</a> Elon Musk&#x2019;s latest stunt, attempting to take Tesla private. And does so perfectly.</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p>Musk amusingly named his promotional flamethrowers<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Not a Flamethrower&#x201D; to get around shipping rules banning flamethrowers, and he seems to have learned the wrong lesson from that stunt. I suspect that naming his public company<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Not a Public Company&#x201D; won&#x2019;t actually work to get around securities laws.</p> </blockquote> <ol start=\"4\" type=\"1\"> <li>The world of technology and science never fails to fascinate me.

To enable this, just set <code>SET_DATE</code> environment variable to <code>true</code>. Additionally, you can also set the <code>TZ</code> variable to override default timezones for the server hosting your endpoint. Refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/blotpub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>README</code></a> for more details.</p> <p>I have also fixed some minor issues in handling the post creation via different clients, mainly Micro.blog iOS client.</p> <p><strong><em>What&#x2019;s next?</em></strong> Handling of image files.</p>\n",

Introducing <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/blotpub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blotpub</a>.</p> <p>It is a self-hosteable Micropub endpoint for blot.im and Dropbox.

Most of the time, I am posting text posts; the current version should be able to handle that.</p> <p>Next, I need to handle the creation of like and reply post types and also handle the image files. It may so happen that I end up getting these done soon. However, I wanted to put the bare bones version out there.</p> <h3 id=\"how-do-i-use-this\">How do I use this?</h3> <p>Well, as I said earlier the <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/blotpub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">source is open</a>. It is a Node application which you can self-host as your own micropub endpoint. I have covered some of the details as part of the project <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/blotpub/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">readme</a>.</p> <p>However, before you use blotpub, there is one essential step from IndieWeb that needs to be addressed - to make your website your identity online. It involves declaring openly your social network profiles as rel-me links and link those profiles back to your site. This allows you to login to any IndieAuth enabled services using your website&#x2019;s homepage - no need to create an account or maintain passwords.</p> <p>You can refer to the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Essential IndiWeb&#x201D; section in <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/display-webmentions/#essential-indieweb\">this post on how to display webmentions</a> on your site. That step applies to using a micropub too.</p> <div class=\"note\"> This is an <strong>early alpha release</strong> of the application. Things may be a bit unstable. Please use it with caution. Also, I will continue to work on this and improve it, so, you may have to refresh your deployment regularly. However, I would be happy if you choose to join me on this bumpy ride - this will only get better with more people using it. </div> <ol type=\"1\"> <li><p><strong>Install</strong>: Just install this as a normal Node.js application. A better way would be to <a href=\"https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/am1t/blotpub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deploy directly to Heroku</a>.</p></li> <li><strong>Grant Dropbox Access</strong>: Generate a <a href=\"https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2014/05/generate-an-access-token-for-your-own-account/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dropbox access token</a> from the Dropbox <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Console</a> to grant the application access to your Dropbox folder. Just create a new app in the console, chose <span class=\"small-caps\">API</span> as Dropbox <span class=\"small-caps\">API</span>, select the type of access as<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Full Dropbox&#x201D; and finally, name your application. You will need this generated token while configuring your application. <note> Just to reiterate the point, the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Permission type&#x201D; for the app that you create for blotpub in dropbox needs to be set to<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Full Dropbox&#x201D; </note></li> <li><p><strong>Configure</strong>: Add the required configuration values via environment variables or the Heroku app deploy dashboard. You will need the token generated above.</p></li> <li><strong>Endpoint Discovery</strong>: Once you have deployed the application, your Micropub endpoint will be available at <code>/micropub</code> (e.g. <code>https://deployed-blotpub-app.com/micropub</code>). <note> Note that the endpoint url is different from your website url. It would be the url for the blotpub application that your installed in the 1st step. </note> <p>For Heroku deployment, it would be something like <code>https://*****.herokuapp.com/micropub</code> (exact url will be available at Heroku dashboard). To enable automatic discovery for your <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/micropub#Endpoint_Discovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Micropub endpoint</a> and <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/obtaining-an-access-token#Discovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">token endpoint</a>, you will need to add the following values to your Blot site&#x2019;s <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> - usually available in the <code>head.html</code> file in your theme/template.</p></li> </ol> <pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;micropub&quot; href=&quot;https://deployed-blotpub-app.com/micropub&quot;&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;token_endpoint&quot; href=&quot;https://tokens.indieauth.com/token&quot;&gt;</code></pre> <ol start=\"5\" type=\"1\"> <li><p><strong>Media Endpoint:</strong> Most of the micropub clients, like quill, can send the media files as <code>multipart</code> data. So, you can attach image while creating a new post. However, some clients like Micro.blog require a <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/micropub_media_endpoint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Media Endpoint</a> to handle the media files (primarily the image files). Blotpub comes with an inbuilt media endpoint. To use it, just configure the <code>MEDIA_ENDPOINT</code> variable in your blotpub deployment to <code>https://deployed-blotpub-app.com/micropub/media</code> (for Heroku, something like <code>https://*****.herokuapp.com/micropub/media</code>). This will allow you to post image from such clients too.</p></li> <li><p>Note that file uploads via blotpub media endpoint will only add the image file at the location configured at <code>PHOTO_PATH</code> and the <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span> to the image will be added to the post metadata as <code>photo: &lt;url-to-image&gt;</code>. To render this in the post, you can add the below code block in <code>entries.html</code> and <code>entry.html</code> in your Blot theme either before or after <code>{{{html}}}</code> as per your preference.</p></li> </ol> <pre><code>{{#metadata.photo} } &lt;img src=&quot;{{metadata.photo} }&quot;&gt; {{/metadata.photo} }</code></pre> <p>You should now be able to post to your Blot site from external Micropub clients (like Micro.blog iOS App, Quill etc). If you do use this, ping me. All your feedback is welcome.</p>\n",

I have covered some of the details as part of the project <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/blotpub/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">readme</a>.</p> <p>However, before you use blotpub, there is one essential step from IndieWeb that needs to be addressed - to make your website your identity online. It involves declaring openly your social network profiles as rel-me links and link those profiles back to your site. This allows you to login to any IndieAuth enabled services using your website&#x2019;s homepage - no need to create an account or maintain passwords.</p> <p>You can refer to the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Essential IndiWeb&#x201D; section in <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/display-webmentions/#essential-indieweb\">this post on how to display webmentions</a> on your site. That step applies to using a micropub too.</p> <div class=\"note\"> This is an <strong>early alpha release</strong> of the application. Things may be a bit unstable. Please use it with caution. Also, I will continue to work on this and improve it, so, you may have to refresh your deployment regularly. However, I would be happy if you choose to join me on this bumpy ride - this will only get better with more people using it. </div> <ol type=\"1\"> <li><p><strong>Install</strong>: Just install this as a normal Node.js application. A better way would be to <a href=\"https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/am1t/blotpub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deploy directly to Heroku</a>.</p></li> <li><strong>Grant Dropbox Access</strong>: Generate a <a href=\"https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2014/05/generate-an-access-token-for-your-own-account/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dropbox access token</a> from the Dropbox <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Console</a> to grant the application access to your Dropbox folder. Just create a new app in the console, chose <span class=\"small-caps\">API</span> as Dropbox <span class=\"small-caps\">API</span>, select the type of access as<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Full Dropbox&#x201D; and finally, name your application. You will need this generated token while configuring your application. <note> Just to reiterate the point, the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Permission type&#x201D; for the app that you create for blotpub in dropbox needs to be set to<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Full Dropbox&#x201D; </note></li> <li><p><strong>Configure</strong>: Add the required configuration values via environment variables or the Heroku app deploy dashboard. You will need the token generated above.</p></li> <li><strong>Endpoint Discovery</strong>: Once you have deployed the application, your Micropub endpoint will be available at <code>/micropub</code> (e.g. <code>https://deployed-blotpub-app.com/micropub</code>). <note> Note that the endpoint url is different from your website url. It would be the url for the blotpub application that your installed in the 1st step. </note> <p>For Heroku deployment, it would be something like <code>https://*****.herokuapp.com/micropub</code> (exact url will be available at Heroku dashboard). To enable automatic discovery for your <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/micropub#Endpoint_Discovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Micropub endpoint</a> and <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/obtaining-an-access-token#Discovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">token endpoint</a>, you will need to add the following values to your Blot site&#x2019;s <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> - usually available in the <code>head.html</code> file in your theme/template.</p></li> </ol> <pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;micropub&quot; href=&quot;https://deployed-blotpub-app.com/micropub&quot;&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;token_endpoint&quot; href=&quot;https://tokens.indieauth.com/token&quot;&gt;</code></pre> <ol start=\"5\" type=\"1\"> <li><p><strong>Media Endpoint:</strong> Most of the micropub clients, like quill, can send the media files as <code>multipart</code> data. So, you can attach image while creating a new post. However, some clients like Micro.blog require a <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/micropub_media_endpoint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Media Endpoint</a> to handle the media files (primarily the image files). Blotpub comes with an inbuilt media endpoint. To use it, just configure the <code>MEDIA_ENDPOINT</code> variable in your blotpub deployment to <code>https://deployed-blotpub-app.com/micropub/media</code> (for Heroku, something like <code>https://*****.herokuapp.com/micropub/media</code>). This will allow you to post image from such clients too.</p></li> <li><p>Note that file uploads via blotpub media endpoint will only add the image file at the location configured at <code>PHOTO_PATH</code> and the <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span> to the image will be added to the post metadata as <code>photo: &lt;url-to-image&gt;</code>. To render this in the post, you can add the below code block in <code>entries.html</code> and <code>entry.html</code> in your Blot theme either before or after <code>{{{html}}}</code> as per your preference.</p></li> </ol> <pre><code>{{#metadata.photo} } &lt;img src=&quot;{{metadata.photo} }&quot;&gt; {{/metadata.photo} }</code></pre> <p>You should now be able to post to your Blot site from external Micropub clients (like Micro.blog iOS App, Quill etc). If you do use this, ping me. All your feedback is welcome.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I had recently <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/journal/39619/\">expressed</a> an excited opinion on Microsub, the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>new&#x201D; Indieweb spec.

I do not think I can read feeds in any other manner now.

And I know people like Aaron Parecki <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/2018/03/12/17/building-an-indieweb-reader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">are hard at work</a> to continue improving the clients like Monocle. However, I think my excitement was premature.</p> <p>No doubt, the core technology behind Microsub is solid and it can eventually redefine the way feeds are subscribed to and consumed. And bundled with Micropub to post actions of the type <em>like</em>, <em>reply</em>, <em>repost</em> directly to your website right from your reading view makes it absolutely magical.</p> <p>So I don&#x2019;t blame myself that I got excited about the standard seeing the potential of what can be achieved when all these Indieweb standards work seamlessly together. <em>Seamless</em> is the key though. For the last few days, I have been trying to use Monocle as my primary feed reader. Unfortunately, the whole system has some way to go before I actually can. I am just noting down the frustrations I encountered using the system.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>Keeping the read status of the posts in sync is flaky. Many of the posts I have read already are shown again. Some of the posts that should have already popped up are not available for some time. When they finally are, they are available in bulk. If I understand the standard correctly, it is the server at fault here. And it is only a single client involved at this point.</li> <li>Subscribing to feeds with the server is not easy. Not user experience wise, but again in terms of the unreliability of the posts appearing in the stream. At times, there are 0 posts fetched; at other times, there is a bulk of hundreds of posts. It poses a challenge for the client.</li> <li>And to the client. I think we can learn from the available feed readers and focus on the must-have features - which are primarily around showing available posts. Monocle currently cannot be configured to show only the new posts. Filter options are limited. Sorting options are limited. Marking read/unread is unavailable. Subscribing to new feeds is not possible (even though spec has a <code>follow</code> <span class=\"small-caps\">API</span> which I hope Aperture exposes). Few of these might be nitpicking, but they are important when the reference for most new users would be existing feed readers.</li> <li>The concept of Microsub server and client, former for maintaining the feeds and the later for displaying them, sounds great. However, to get people on board, we will need at least one application that does the job of both.

So no doubt there would be some kinks in the working. The intention of this post is in no way to demean the people involved or pinpoint at the failures.

				"content_html": "<p>Austin Kleon wrote <a href=\"https://austinkleon.com/2018/05/18/a-bad-equation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a nice article</a> advising creators, especially writers, to not fall prey to a belief frequently floated around -<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>you lose a book for every child&#x201D;.</p> <p>I do not think the fact that such a belief exists is much of a stretch. Being a parent is work, a lot of work. It needs time, time that can be spent on other activities, even productive ones. It needs patience, which again eats into one&#x2019;s own time. Own time where many creative people find their zone, find the space where they can think, they can create. And that is applicable to every creator, not just a writer.</p> <p>Austin&#x2019;s post is a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/michael-chabon-are-kids-the-enemy-of-writing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an account</a> from Michael Chabon of an interaction he had with a fellow experienced writer. He was given this advice, then, to not have any children. Reasoning Chabon was provided, along with examples, was explicit and, as he calls it, brutal.</p> <blockquote> <p>Writing was a practice. The more you wrote, the better a writer you became and the more books you produced. Excellence plus productivity, that was the formula for sustained success, and time was the coefficient of both. Children, the great man said, were notorious thieves of time. Then there was the question of subject matter, settings, experiences; books were hungry things, and if you stayed too long in any one place, they would consume everything and everyone around you. You needed to keep moving, always onward, a literary Masai driving your ravenous herd of novels. Travel, therefore, was a must, and I should take his word for it because he had made a careful study: Traveling with children was the world&#x2019;s biggest pain in the ass.</p> </blockquote> <p>So no doubt, parenting can affect one&#x2019;s ability to create, to write especially if the great writer from Chabon&#x2019;s account is to be believed. And so the belief and advice,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>for each child you lose a book&#x201D; - Kleon calls it a bad equation. He refutes it with his own experience.</p> <blockquote> <p>It&#x2019;s not that my boys magically made me a better person and a better artist, it&#x2019;s that my boys make me want to be a better person and a better artist.<br /> <br /> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Art is too long, and life is too short,&#x201D; wrote Grace Paley.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>There&#x2019;s a lot more to do in life than just writing.&#x201D;</p> </blockquote> <p>That is very well said. But for me personally, I do not believe creativity and parenthood are variables of any rational equation. How one affects the other is multi-dimensional, unlike in an equation. There are cases where parenthood leads to, unearths one&#x2019;s creativity. Kleon gives few examples including A. A. Milne&#x2019;s. And then there are cases where parenthood forces one, lends one the creative energy necessary to complete the story at hand. J. K. Rowling <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060421032312/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/biography.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">narrates</a> her experience of the origin of the Harry Potter, a story that was in works for 5 years before her daughter was born (<em>emphasis mine</em>).</p> <blockquote> <p>I knew that full-time teaching, with all the marking and lesson planning, <strong>let alone with a small daughter to care for single-handedly</strong>, would leave me with absolutely no spare time at all. And so I set to work in a kind of frenzy, determined to finish the book and at least try and get it published. Whenever Jessica fell asleep in her pushchair I would dash to the nearest cafe and write like mad. I wrote nearly every evening. Then I had to type the whole thing out myself. Sometimes I actually hated the book, even while I loved it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fascinating that a stuck creation was completed while struggling and juggling the duties of parenthood. So maybe Rowling lost <em>one</em> novel when she became a mother; but that one lost novel gave the world seven new gems.</p> <p>I myself am a father to a daughter. She commands time from me, and she deserves it. Does it mean it eats into some of my writing time? Oh, absolutely. But do I ever regret that lost time? Certainly not. My life has been a lot colourful with my daughter&#x2019;s presence. Every day that I spend with her writes a new story.

This also reminds me of a post I had written arguing everyone can write&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;all it takes is a will and belief in oneself. Following is an excerpt from that post.</p> <hr /> <p>One way to think of writing is to jot down abundance of words, leading towards a story or an account. Another way is to simply think of it as expressing oneself. Every person often comes across such occasions to put his thought, his ideas, his expressions in words. Occasions are aplenty. Event in his own life. Event in the lives of acquaintances, friends or near &amp; dear ones. Or just a public event.</p> <p>One of my friends had a similar occasion, one close to his heart. It was anniversary of his engagement with his fianc&#xE9;, theirs 1st. He took all the pains to decide on the gift, the place to buy it from, flowers to go with it and the time to be delivered at. And then he did what I see people doing most often. He went to google and typed<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>1st anniversary wishes/messages&#x201D;. I wondered why did he not just scribble what he felt?</p> <p>It&#x2019;s saddening to see people resist the efforts to pen the words they think of. They go after what others have written, beautifully never-the-less, but at the cost of it being not real, fake. They underestimate the power of conveying one&#x2019;s own feelings in whichever way possible. The words, their structure won&#x2019;t matter much then. And that is one way one can start writing.</p> <p>Don&#x2019;t miss a chance to write to your loved ones, breed a will to do so. Wish them, appreciate them, console them. Keep it simple, write the words you feel. Take effort to make it personal, involving.</p> <p>And finally, have belief in yourself.</p> <blockquote> <p>And by the way, everything in life is writable about if you have the outgoing guts to do it, and the imagination to improvise. The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt.<br /> <br /> -Sylvia Plath</p> </blockquote> <p>So next time you get an occasion to wish someone, don&#x2019;t doubt yourself. Start writing.

However, how do you enable conservations with them? If enabled, every time you or your website is referenced online, if they are IndieWeb Level 2 enabled, you are notified by Webmentions, another <span class=\"small-caps\">W3C</span> Recommendation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n\n<p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Webmention is a simple way to automatically notify any <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span> when you link to it on your site.

But how do you enable your site to receive web mention?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Again, it involves hosting and declaring a webmention endpoint. Of course, the active community already has a ready solution for this - <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://webmention.io\" target=\"_blank\">webmention.io</a> by <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://voxpelli.com\" target=\"_blank\">Pelle Wessman</a>. It is <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>a hosted service created to easily handle webmentions”. All you have to do is sign in with your domain (i.e. validate your identity) and let webmention.io receive all mentions to your site. Once that’s done, just declare the web mention endpoint as below in your <code>head</code>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n\n<p><pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code> &lt;link rel=&ldquo;webmention&rdquo; href=&ldquo;<a href=\"https://webmention.io/username/webmention&quot;\">https://webmention.io/username/webmention&quot;</a> /&gt;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Webmention.io also provides APIs for you to fetch the webmentions to your content/site. You can implement your own solution for fetching and displaying these mentions along with posts. I have a simple Javascript to fetch and display them with posts — this is still a work in progress.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n\n<p><h2 id=\"interactions-from-social-media\">Interactions from Social Media</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Though references to your posts from IndieWeb sites are handled, what about the references made on Twitter or Facebook? It can be in any form of response (i.e.&nbsp;likes, retweets/reposts) to the syndicated post. Of course, they do not send webmentions (wish they did).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>One option is to implement your own <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://indieweb.org/backfeed\" target=\"_blank\">backfeed</a> to poll for such interactions and handle them as a response.

I understand it might get overwhelming if you read it as a long sequence of steps. But trust me, the changes to be made are neither too many nor too complicated. It is just setting your site with appropriate markups and endpoints. There is also a really helpful guide in <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://indiewebify.me/\" target=\"_blank\">IndieWebify.me</a> that walks you through every step, and also validates if you have everything set up correctly. But if you still do not want to go through the trouble, I have <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/am1t/ghostwriter\" target=\"_blank\">open sourced</a> the changes I made to the theme I was using. You can use this theme, style it as per your liking, if needed, and get going.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>For me though, there was one more thing pending. At the same time I was doing setting this up, <a href=\"https://micro.blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">micro.blog</a> had caught my attention. I already had <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/journal\">a section</a> dedicated for the microposts. I configured a feed for these posts, the microblogs, to syndicate to my micro.blog timeline too. I was enjoying the interactions I was being part of with the community there<a id=\"ref-2PHF\" class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#footnote-2PHF\"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>There was just one issue, I could not use it to post to my site. My process to post to this site still involved text editors and git commits. I wish it was simpler<br> — at least for such microblogs. I wish I could just <em>post</em> from micro.blog and have an entry made. Enter <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Micropub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Micropub</a>, again another <span class=\"small-caps\">W3C</span> Recommendation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>It is the trickiest part of the puzzle. Again it involves creating an endpoint which can accept a request to post, verify that it is coming from an authorised source and finally create the post file in required structure for Hugo to build and deploy. I have enabled the support for Micropub on this site, thanks again to <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://voxpelli.com\" target=\"_blank\">Paul</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>I would like to detail out the solution I have running. But that would be a topic for another detailed post.

This is possible by identifying the layouts that handle your posts and adding some markups to it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had to modify the <code>/layouts/partials/post-header.html</code>, <code>/layouts/partials/post-content.html</code> and <code>/layouts/post/single.html</code>. The information I declare is post title (<code>p-name</code>), post URL (<code>u-url</code>), author (<code>p-author</code>), date (<code>dt-published</code>) and, of course, the content (<code>e-content</code>). Finally, a typical post template looks as below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;article class=\"h-entry\"> \n    &lt;h1 class=\"post-title p-name\" itemprop=\"name headline\">&#123;&#123; .Title }}&lt;/h1>\n    &lt;span>Published &lt;a class=\"u-url\" href=\"&#123;&#123; .Permalink }}\"> \n        &lt;time class=\"dt-published\">&#123;&#123; .Date }}&lt;/time>\n    &lt;/a> &lt;/span> \n    &lt;span>by&lt;/span> &lt;span class=\"p-author\">&#123;&#123; .Params.author | default .Site.Author.name }}&lt;/span> \n    &lt;div class=\"post-content clearfix e-content\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> &#123;&#123; .Content }} &lt;/div> \n&lt;/article></code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"cross-site-conversations-via-webmentions\">Cross-site conversations via Webmentions</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All the steps done till now allow defining your and your content’s identity for external websites. However, how do you enable conservations with them? If enabled, every time you or your website is referenced online, if they are IndieWeb Level 2 enabled, you are notified by Webmentions, another <span class=\"small-caps\">W3C</span> Recommendation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Webmention is a simple way to automatically notify any <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span> when you link to it on your site. From the receivers perspective, it’s a way to request notification when other sites link to it.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In short, it is a modern alternative to erstwhile Pingback mechanism in prime blogging days. Of course, you have to enable your site to both send and receive web mentions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To send a webmention to the page you have referenced, you can notify by</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>using a form made available on the referenced page</li><li>using curl or one of the many open-source clients</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the referenced site can receive webmentions, they would be notified that you have linked to them. But how do you enable your site to receive web mention?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Again, it involves hosting and declaring a webmention endpoint. Of course, the active community already has a ready solution for this - <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://webmention.io\" target=\"_blank\">webmention.io</a> by <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://voxpelli.com\" target=\"_blank\">Pelle Wessman</a>. It is <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>a hosted service created to easily handle webmentions”. All you have to do is sign in with your domain (i.e. validate your identity) and let webmention.io receive all mentions to your site. Once that’s done, just declare the web mention endpoint as below in your <code>head</code>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code> &lt;link rel=\"webmention\" href=\"https://webmention.io/username/webmention\" /></code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Webmention.io also provides APIs for you to fetch the webmentions to your content/site. You can implement your own solution for fetching and displaying these mentions along with posts. I have a simple Javascript to fetch and display them with posts — this is still a work in progress.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"interactions-from-social-media\">Interactions from Social Media</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Though references to your posts from IndieWeb sites are handled, what about the references made on Twitter or Facebook? It can be in any form of response (i.e.&nbsp;likes, retweets/reposts) to the syndicated post. Of course, they do not send webmentions (wish they did).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One option is to implement your own <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://indieweb.org/backfeed\" target=\"_blank\">backfeed</a> to poll for such interactions and handle them as a response. Well, of course, the community has made sure there is a simpler hosted option. Enter <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://indieweb.org/Bridgy\" target=\"_blank\">Bridgy</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Bridgy is an open source project and proxy that implements backfeed and <span class=\"small-caps\">POSSE</span> as a service. Bridgy sends webmentions for comments, likes, etc. on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, and Flickr.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was set — now, every time there is interaction about my post on a service, bridgy captures that and sends a webmention to my endpoint.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"one-more-thing---micropub\">One More Thing - Micropub</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At this point, I had completely IndieWebified this site. I understand it might get overwhelming if you read it as a long sequence of steps. But trust me, the changes to be made are neither too many nor too complicated. It is just setting your site with appropriate markups and endpoints. There is also a really helpful guide in <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://indiewebify.me/\" target=\"_blank\">IndieWebify.me</a> that walks you through every step, and also validates if you have everything set up correctly. But if you still do not want to go through the trouble, I have <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/am1t/ghostwriter\" target=\"_blank\">open sourced</a> the changes I made to the theme I was using. You can use this theme, style it as per your liking, if needed, and get going.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For me though, there was one more thing pending. At the same time I was doing setting this up, <a href=\"https://micro.blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">micro.blog</a> had caught my attention. I already had <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/journal\">a section</a> dedicated for the microposts. I configured a feed for these posts, the microblogs, to syndicate to my micro.blog timeline too. I was enjoying the interactions I was being part of with the community there<a id=\"ref-2PHF\" class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#footnote-2PHF\"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There was just one issue, I could not use it to post to my site. My process to post to this site still involved text editors and git commits. I wish it was simpler<br> — at least for such microblogs. I wish I could just <em>post</em> from micro.blog and have an entry made. Enter <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Micropub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Micropub</a>, again another <span class=\"small-caps\">W3C</span> Recommendation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is the trickiest part of the puzzle. Again it involves creating an endpoint which can accept a request to post, verify that it is coming from an authorised source and finally create the post file in required structure for Hugo to build and deploy. I have enabled the support for Micropub on this site, thanks again to <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://voxpelli.com\" target=\"_blank\">Paul</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I would like to detail out the solution I have running. But that would be a topic for another detailed post. In short, I hosted Paul’s open-source <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/am1t/webpage-micropub-to-github\" target=\"_blank\">micropub endpoint</a><a id=\"ref-3PHF\" class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#footnote-3PHF\"><sup>3</sup></a>, configured it to generate the post in the format I need, configured it to commit to my website source at GitHub, declared it as my site’s micropub endpoint and then let Netlify handle the rest.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You bet I would say it was all simple. I won’t.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have realised that the idea of owning your identity online is a crucial facet of protecting yourself and your content in this fragile, siloed world of internet. It may be perceived as ostentatious by many, but it is rather humble, driven by a virtuous intent. There is nothing wrong in attempting to control what you post online, to make sure it stays online till you want it to. IndieWeb project allows that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I do also realise that it is naive to think no one getting online will find this process irksome. Even though well defined, the principles are not for all. The simplicity of using and posting on social media services will continue to attract regular users<a id=\"ref-4PHF\" class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#footnote-4PHF\"><sup>4</sup></a>. However, here’s wishing that at least a part of these users are inspired to get their own personal domain.

Rather, no such standard principles are even debated over and agreed upon.</li> <li>Smart home devices tend to ping their original homes, the servers, dial in and report on duty very frequently. Typically, for no good reason.</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p>An exaggerated version of this was seen in the Echo and Echo Dot, which were in constant communication with Amazon&#x2019;s servers, sending a request every couple of minutes to <a href=\"http://spectrum.s3.amazonaws.com/kindle-wifi/wifistub-echo.html\" class=\"uri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://spectrum.s3.amazonaws.com/kindle-wifi/wifistub-echo.html</a>. Even without the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Alexa&#x201D; wake word, and even when the microphone is turned off, the Echo is frequently checking in with Amazon, confirming it is online and looking for updates.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, your router remains the prominent data collector for your online presence. Your <span class=\"small-caps\">ISP</span>, the prominent data aggregator. <em>And neither are really too keen to protect your data online</em>.</p> <p>I guess everyone agrees that smart homes are dumb, and there are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/internetofshit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">enough evidences</a> of that pouring in every day. Problem is they are capable of knowing so much about you. And, at times, sending it out there in open without protecting it in any way &#x2014; lending them a lot of power.</p> <p>Dumb and powerful, now there&#x2019;s the super villain from any sane person&#x2019;s nightmare.</p>\n",

Anyway, do you know a lot about Microwaves?”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Rao is taken aback by the direct question. <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Why? Me?

Why do you feel that that harmless device is the reason we are sitting here Rao?”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Rao continues to stare at Naik, his heart pounding now. <em>I have no idea what’s cooking inside this devil’s mind.</em> The perspiration is now clearly visible on his forehead. <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Mr Naik, I have no idea what you are hinting at. On my way here, Adi had mentioned that Joy’s died of electric shock. I see him lying here on the floor, his legs towards the Microwave, with it still displaying the time since it had been on. Other than Joy’s fallen body, nothing else looks out of sort for this room. There are no signs of any combat that might have played out here last night.

I haven’t been to the kitchen since then — came here only in the morning today when you called me. I do not know Joy well, neither did I have an issue with him.

However, by now, his existence was under the fastidious care of his loneliness.</p> <p>A silent persistent rumble brought Rick back to the reality. His heart sank to see how much mess the repairman was leaving behind in his house.</p> <p>Unable to bear the ruin, Rick shouted,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Do you really have to screw around my whole house, strewing all your mess all across the floor?&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Of course. Your neighbour has paid me to do,&#x201D; teased the repairman. Realising how futile it was to kid around this sobersides, he corrected himself,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span>Your neighbour has complained he hears a lot of noise in this wall, he is afraid there is a rat or some living creature in here.&#x201D;</p> <p><em>How can there be?</em>, wondered Rick within.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span>You have to go, now,&#x201D; snarled Rick.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Why? If there is a rat, it will help you too.&#x201D; The repairman resumed his work &#x2014; Rick perceived it as nothing less than carnage.</p> <p><em>He has to <strong>go</strong>. Now.</em></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><p>A good round-up by Quartz on why Microsoft failed with Windows Phone; an attempt is also made to run with an alternate reality where Microsoft has avoided that. Its based on Microsoft declaring<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span><em>Windows Phone is free</em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Compared to Google, Microsoft has much stronger connections to hardware OEMs on the one hand and software developers on the other. Its products are widely used and respected by business and consumer customers alike. By offering the Windows Phone platform for free, the company sacrifices licensing revenue, but this unnatural act is more than compensated for by the expansion of the Windows ecosystem.

				"content_html": "<p><p>I have <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/things-are-changing/\">recently converted</a> my blog to a website and, as I <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/page/setup\">have already documented</a>, I serve it as a static website. I have preferred this approach over a dynamic one that gets driven by a full-fledged <a href=\"https://Wordpress.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blogging software</a> or a <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">publishing platform</a>. Of course, these were not the only possible options. As is so <a href=\"https://www.thesitewizard.com/gettingstarted/difference-cms-site-builder.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">well captured</a> by Christopher Heng at his website<a href=\"#footnote-18IH\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-18IH\"><sup>1</sup></a>, the options are just too many.</p> <p>It wasn&#x2019;t an easy call to select one, it never is. Every option one chooses has its own advantages and disadvantages. And, of course, going with a standalone website builder and serving the content as <em>pure</em> <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span> had its own too. For me, though, benefits really outweighed the challenges.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/_img/writing-setup.jpg\" alt=\"writing setup\"></p> <h2 id=\"why-choose-a-static-website-for-blogs\">Why choose a static website for blogs?</h2> <p>A static website is nothing but a string of <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span> pages served by a hosted web server. Every document, blog post or update is a plain <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span> page. Given this simplicity of existence, it has some key benefits that attracted me.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>It&#x2019;s quick and cheap to develop</li> <li>It&#x2019;s easy and cheap to host</li> <li>It&#x2019;s fast to be served</li> </ol> <p>Again, Hugo <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/about/benefits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">captures</a> them the best.</p> <blockquote> <p>Improved performance, security and ease of use are just a few of the reasons static site generators are so appealing.<br /> <br /> The most noticeable is performance. <span class=\"small-caps\">HTTP</span> servers are very good at sending files&#x2014;so good, in fact, that you can effectively serve the same number of pages with a fraction of the memory and <span class=\"small-caps\">CPU</span> needed for a dynamic site.</p> </blockquote> <p>I have already seen this benefit realised with the performance of my website too.</p> <p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Static website has really helped the overall performance &#x2014; avg response time has gone down from 1300ms to 300ms. &#x1F44A;&#x1F3FD;&#x1F60A; <a href=\"https://t.co/pPoQNMXCsM\">https://t.co/pPoQNMXCsM</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/udsTKM0RpO\">pic.twitter.com/udsTKM0RpO</a></p>&#x2014; Amit Gawande (@_am1t) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_am1t/status/898586698895904768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 18, 2017</a></blockquote> </p> <p>These benefits should attract every blogger out there looking for a simple manageable solution for their blogs. <em>Then why aren&#x2019;t all blogs served as static website?</em> The answer is, of course, nothing&#x2019;s perfect and static websites are not for all. They bring with themselves a list of challenges.</p> <p>Creating static pages needs a bit of programming skill, and a lot of interest to slog it out over web design and development. In the longer run, maintaining these pages can become cumbersome if they are to be updated even so slightly, every now and then. Especially, if all you care about is the text you write, what gets placed around it is really not of much an interest to you. All you want to do is write and publish. You don&#x2019;t want to awaken the web dev in you every time you want your footer to be updated or a page to be added.</p> <p>Ironically, a rush to dynamic websites to solve this challenge is totally counter to what you really care about, the text. The text is light, the page carrying them needs to be the same. To have these generated every time someone requests for them<a href=\"#footnote-28IH\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-28IH\"><sup>2</sup></a> is just too costly. And to have them stored as database entries is just too messy. <strong>It is text, it needs to be stored as text.</strong></p> <p>Hugo (and <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/static-website-generators-jekyll-middleman-roots-hugo-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the likes</a>) provides a nice middle ground. Smashing Magazine summarizes it well.</p> <blockquote> <p>Each generator takes a repository with plain-text files, runs one or more compilation phases, and spits out a folder with a static website that can be hosted anywhere. No <span class=\"small-caps\">PHP</span> or database needed.<br /> <br /> Hugo takes caching a step further and all <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span> files are rendered on your computer. You can review the files locally before copying them to the computer hosting the <span class=\"small-caps\">HTTP</span> server.</p> </blockquote> <p>Isn&#x2019;t it, after all, better to make the whole user-facing part of your website into a cache of servable <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span> pages and have it generated and deployed locally&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;without loading the server with a programming runtime or a database? This is exactly what Hugo enables.</p> <p>This helps to design, build, test and maintain the website without much of a hassle. And with Hugo, I have already hit all the benefits of a static website I mentioned above, bypassing the challenges it presents. A one-time effort to design and build the website is handled with little pain; now I can focus on writing.</p> <h2 id=\"workflow-to-write-especially-on-mobile\">Workflow to write, especially on mobile</h2> <p>There is another challenge with such websites that are built locally and served statically - all they contain is the final product, the HTMLs. Any change needs to be followed by a rebuild and redeploy. There is no online <span class=\"small-caps\">CMS</span> to handle your content from a browser, especially no <span class=\"small-caps\">WYSIWYG</span><a href=\"#footnote-38IH\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-38IH\"><sup>3</sup></a> web editor to create or modify your posts. Of course, one way to handle this is to deploy a <a href=\"https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/1325/allowing-customers-to-edit-static-website-via-wysiwyg#1438\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">separate light-weight <span class=\"small-caps\">CMS</span></a>.</p> <p>But for blogging, there is a simple way. All you need is a continuous deployment setup and a couple of applications to handle writing and publishing your posts. I have <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/page/setup/#deploying-with-netlify\">already explained</a> how Netlify has helped me achieve the first part. Below is how I circumvent the second challenge<a href=\"#footnote-48IH\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-48IH\"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li><p><strong>Write</strong>: It is important you can write from multiple places, especially your mobile devices. Web editors of the blogging platforms allow you just that, keeping your drafts ready for you to pick up from where you left earlier. A static website lacks this and so calls for some other alternatives.</p> <p>I use <a href=\"https://ia.net/writer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iA Writer</a> to write all my posts. It has apps for all the platforms I own, iOS and macOS. It allows me to focus mainly on writing, automatically saving all the words as I write them. It also keeps all the posts synced up across all the devices, granting me the convenience of cross-device writing that web editors enable. I find it goes even a step further as it provides me a consistent experience across all the platforms, as compared to the messy state of online writing&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;more on this later.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Deploy</strong>: Doing this from desktop was always trivial; handling this from mobile was what puzzled me. However I managed to get a workable solution. Once I have the post ready, I use <a href=\"https://git2go.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Git2Go</a> to push the final Markdown (.md) files to my Git repository. Net\nlify does the rest, making the post available at the website. Any minor modifications, it is just an update with iA Writer to these&#xA0;.md files and a push via Git2Go.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Workflow</strong>: Though it is easy to say just write at one place and push to repository, it would be a significant effort to get a file, as per Hugo-defined format, ready for writing. Any generator needs some added metadata, <em>front matter</em> in Hugo land, embedded along with the content to create a serve-ready <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span>. Adding this to every post I write would have been a downer; especially with my intention of writing different types of posts - fiction, non-fiction and links.</p> <p>It needed <a href=\"https://www.workflow.is/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Workflow</a>, I mean literally.

				"content_text": "<p>I have <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/things-are-changing/\">recently converted</a> my blog to a website and, as I <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/page/setup\">have already documented</a>, I serve it as a static website. I have preferred this approach over a dynamic one that gets driven by a full-fledged <a href=\"https://Wordpress.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blogging software</a> or a <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">publishing platform</a>. Of course, these were not the only possible options. As is so <a href=\"https://www.thesitewizard.com/gettingstarted/difference-cms-site-builder.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">well captured</a> by Christopher Heng at his website<a href=\"#footnote-18IH\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-18IH\"><sup>1</sup></a>, the options are just too many.</p> <p>It wasn&#x2019;t an easy call to select one, it never is. Every option one chooses has its own advantages and disadvantages. And, of course, going with a standalone website builder and serving the content as <em>pure</em> <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span> had its own too. For me, though, benefits really outweighed the challenges.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/_img/writing-setup.jpg\" alt=\"writing setup\"></p> <h2 id=\"why-choose-a-static-website-for-blogs\">Why choose a static website for blogs?</h2> <p>A static website is nothing but a string of <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span> pages served by a hosted web server. Every document, blog post or update is a plain <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span> page. Given this simplicity of existence, it has some key benefits that attracted me.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>It&#x2019;s quick and cheap to develop</li> <li>It&#x2019;s easy and cheap to host</li> <li>It&#x2019;s fast to be served</li> </ol> <p>Again, Hugo <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/about/benefits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">captures</a> them the best.</p> <blockquote> <p>Improved performance, security and ease of use are just a few of the reasons static site generators are so appealing.<br /> <br /> The most noticeable is performance. <span class=\"small-caps\">HTTP</span> servers are very good at sending files&#x2014;so good, in fact, that you can effectively serve the same number of pages with a fraction of the memory and <span class=\"small-caps\">CPU</span> needed for a dynamic site.</p> </blockquote> <p>I have already seen this benefit realised with the performance of my website too.</p> <p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Static website has really helped the overall performance &#x2014; avg response time has gone down from 1300ms to 300ms. &#x1F44A;&#x1F3FD;&#x1F60A; <a href=\"https://t.co/pPoQNMXCsM\">https://t.co/pPoQNMXCsM</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/udsTKM0RpO\">pic.twitter.com/udsTKM0RpO</a></p>&#x2014; Amit Gawande (@_am1t) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_am1t/status/898586698895904768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 18, 2017</a></blockquote> </p> <p>These benefits should attract every blogger out there looking for a simple manageable solution for their blogs. <em>Then why aren&#x2019;t all blogs served as static website?</em> The answer is, of course, nothing&#x2019;s perfect and static websites are not for all. They bring with themselves a list of challenges.</p> <p>Creating static pages needs a bit of programming skill, and a lot of interest to slog it out over web design and development. In the longer run, maintaining these pages can become cumbersome if they are to be updated even so slightly, every now and then. Especially, if all you care about is the text you write, what gets placed around it is really not of much an interest to you. All you want to do is write and publish. You don&#x2019;t want to awaken the web dev in you every time you want your footer to be updated or a page to be added.</p> <p>Ironically, a rush to dynamic websites to solve this challenge is totally counter to what you really care about, the text. The text is light, the page carrying them needs to be the same. To have these generated every time someone requests for them<a href=\"#footnote-28IH\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-28IH\"><sup>2</sup></a> is just too costly. And to have them stored as database entries is just too messy. <strong>It is text, it needs to be stored as text.</strong></p> <p>Hugo (and <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/static-website-generators-jekyll-middleman-roots-hugo-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the likes</a>) provides a nice middle ground. Smashing Magazine summarizes it well.</p> <blockquote> <p>Each generator takes a repository with plain-text files, runs one or more compilation phases, and spits out a folder with a static website that can be hosted anywhere. No <span class=\"small-caps\">PHP</span> or database needed.<br /> <br /> Hugo takes caching a step further and all <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span> files are rendered on your computer. You can review the files locally before copying them to the computer hosting the <span class=\"small-caps\">HTTP</span> server.</p> </blockquote> <p>Isn&#x2019;t it, after all, better to make the whole user-facing part of your website into a cache of servable <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span> pages and have it generated and deployed locally&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;without loading the server with a programming runtime or a database? This is exactly what Hugo enables.</p> <p>This helps to design, build, test and maintain the website without much of a hassle. And with Hugo, I have already hit all the benefits of a static website I mentioned above, bypassing the challenges it presents. A one-time effort to design and build the website is handled with little pain; now I can focus on writing.</p> <h2 id=\"workflow-to-write-especially-on-mobile\">Workflow to write, especially on mobile</h2> <p>There is another challenge with such websites that are built locally and served statically - all they contain is the final product, the HTMLs. Any change needs to be followed by a rebuild and redeploy. There is no online <span class=\"small-caps\">CMS</span> to handle your content from a browser, especially no <span class=\"small-caps\">WYSIWYG</span><a href=\"#footnote-38IH\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-38IH\"><sup>3</sup></a> web editor to create or modify your posts. Of course, one way to handle this is to deploy a <a href=\"https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/1325/allowing-customers-to-edit-static-website-via-wysiwyg#1438\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">separate light-weight <span class=\"small-caps\">CMS</span></a>.</p> <p>But for blogging, there is a simple way. All you need is a continuous deployment setup and a couple of applications to handle writing and publishing your posts. I have <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/page/setup/#deploying-with-netlify\">already explained</a> how Netlify has helped me achieve the first part. Below is how I circumvent the second challenge<a href=\"#footnote-48IH\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"ref-48IH\"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li><p><strong>Write</strong>: It is important you can write from multiple places, especially your mobile devices. Web editors of the blogging platforms allow you just that, keeping your drafts ready for you to pick up from where you left earlier. A static website lacks this and so calls for some other alternatives.</p> <p>I use <a href=\"https://ia.net/writer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iA Writer</a> to write all my posts. It has apps for all the platforms I own, iOS and macOS. It allows me to focus mainly on writing, automatically saving all the words as I write them. It also keeps all the posts synced up across all the devices, granting me the convenience of cross-device writing that web editors enable. I find it goes even a step further as it provides me a consistent experience across all the platforms, as compared to the messy state of online writing&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;more on this later.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Deploy</strong>: Doing this from desktop was always trivial; handling this from mobile was what puzzled me. However I managed to get a workable solution. Once I have the post ready, I use <a href=\"https://git2go.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Git2Go</a> to push the final Markdown (.md) files to my Git repository. Net\nlify does the rest, making the post available at the website. Any minor modifications, it is just an update with iA Writer to these&#xA0;.md files and a push via Git2Go.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Workflow</strong>: Though it is easy to say just write at one place and push to repository, it would be a significant effort to get a file, as per Hugo-defined format, ready for writing. Any generator needs some added metadata, <em>front matter</em> in Hugo land, embedded along with the content to create a serve-ready <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span>. Adding this to every post I write would have been a downer; especially with my intention of writing different types of posts - fiction, non-fiction and links.</p> <p>It needed <a href=\"https://www.workflow.is/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Workflow</a>, I mean literally.

Sana had not yet come across a single topic which had him stumped.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sana, on the other hand, was miserably inadequate at work. She rarely completed stuff assigned to her on her own, helping others was unthinkable. She wasn’t too keen either, as it involved interacting with them. As part of a group, she was perceived to be the pensive dumbo. She rarely added anything to a conversation, but got always swayed by everyone’s perspective. More often than not, she left a conversation being bitter for her inability to contribute.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not Joel. He was never seen fussed. Outside of work, he dialled his impressiveness up a notch. He was a terrific singer — Sana believed he was good enough to be a lead singer of any band. Every party had a performance from the cheery guy. Him, strumming guitar, and his soulful crooning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sana had no interests, no passions. She was into her late twenties, and she had no profile to boast of. Every attempt of hers to break free was shot down mercilessly by her fate. Some by the fateful accident that took her family away. Some by the untimely fire that took her friends away. Fate never allowed Sana to be the unfettered child, burdening her always with the needs of ever debasing circumstances.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Sana?”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sana was woken up by a collective shrill around her. Everyone was looking at her. And she, through her teary eyes, had been looking at Joel, a usual guitar in his hand. She, then, heard Joel speak.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Yes, her. She is a great singer. I have heard her croon many times.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fate, over her life, had nurtured Sana to be a grouchy wench. Sana hated Joel for dissuading her from being herself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>This is my personal place, a destination where one can find every thought I ever post on the web, anywhere. At times it originates, and so just exists, here. There are also times when it’s <a href=\"https://medium.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">published</a> at <a href=\"https://theweeklyknob.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">some</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/misplaced-identities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">other</a> <a href=\"https://crossingenres.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">places</a> first, but is also made available here. It has been in existence since 2008 and just like every year, this time too I wanted another fresh start for this place.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>I have already documented all the <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/things-are-changing/#simplicity-vs-customisation\">history behind</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/things-are-changing/#enter-hugo\">context for</a> the existence of this site and this page. Here, I intend to document all there’s to know about this site.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Before I get to the details, this is what I set to achieve when I began.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"1\"} -->\n\n<p><ol type=\"1\"><li>A website designed, in and out, to my liking, with every knob controlled by me.</li><li>A landing page with a brief about me and the site. One that clearly links to the key content.</li><li>Clean and simple experience, while reading a post or navigating the site.</li><li>Consistent writing experience, preferably offline, across mobile and desktop.</li><li>Source control for the whole place. No fallouts from brain freezes.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>I do not believe what I sought out was that complex. So I was confident I could get this working.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"post-note\"} -->\n\n<p><p class=\"post-note\"><strong>Here’s the <code>TL;DR</code> version of what I have achieved.</strong> <br><strong>1.</strong> <del>This</del> My old site was built with Hugo — it is extremely simple, highly customisable, well documented and has an active community. It’s difficult to beat all of that. <a href=\"#core-engine-hugo\">∞</a> <br><strong>2.</strong> The look and layout of this site is themed by an extremely personalised port of the original <span class=\"pull-single\">‘</span>ghostwriter’ theme. I intend to open-source the same soon. <a href=\"#personalising-the-look-layout\">∞</a> <br><strong>3.</strong> The source for the complete website along with all the posts, as markdown files, resides in GitHub. Every change to this setup is driven as it would be in a standard git project. <a href=\"#cushioning-against-brain-freeze\">∞</a> <br><strong>4.</strong> Contents from Squarespace were exported into a Wordpress package first. They were converted into markdown files using ExitWP. Followed by cleanup. And deploy. <a href=\"#migrating-the-content\">∞</a> <br><strong>5.</strong> This site is deployed by Netlify. With continuous deployment and one-click <span class=\"small-caps\">SSL</span> for custom domains possible with minimum configuration, the choice was pretty simple. <a href=\"#deploying-with-netlify\">∞</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n\n<p><h2 id=\"core-engine---hugo\">Core Engine - Hugo</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>I had always wanted to attempt a site creation from scratch, but I failed miserably every single time. Given I had ample time before my Squarespace subscription expired, I attempted it again this time. I believe I did not fail. This is a static site, built with <a href=\"http://gohugo.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hugo</a>. It was the ease with which I could get a site running on my dev environment via Hugo that convinced me about the viability of this whole project. If you do not believe, just head over to the Hugo docs for a <em><a href=\"http://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quick start</a></em> and begin. You will have a site running by step two. It is that easy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>You would have also realised how well document the whole framework is from your visit to the quick start guide. There is nothing that you want to achieve that isn’t documented. In addition, given that Hugo is written in <a href=\"https://golang.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GoLang</a>, it gave me an opportunity to learn a new language. Post that, every need of mine to get the things just right was just a code snippet away.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>For example, find below a snippet for fetching a list of random five articles. Yes, it is easy. And a lot powerful.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:preformatted -->\n\n<p><pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&#123;&#123; $pag := where .Data.Pages &ldquo;type&rdquo; &ldquo;post&rdquo; } } &#123;&#123; range (shuffle $pag | first 5) } } &#123;&#123; &hellip;.custom&hellip;. } } &#123;&#123; end } }</pre>\n<!-- /wp:preformatted --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>And if it does turn out that there is some tricky edge case that you just can’t get your head around (or you are being plain, simple lazy), there is a <a href=\"https://discourse.gohugo.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">thriving community</a> of fellow users which is extremely active and a lot helpful.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"post-note\"} -->\n\n<p><p class=\"post-note\"><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Hugo is simple, highly customisable, well documented and has an active community. It’s difficult to beat that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n\n<p><h2 id=\"personalising-the-look-layout\">Personalising the look &amp; layout</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Once I had the core finalised, I shifted my attention to personalising the site. And again Hugo comes with a lot of good looking <a href=\"http://themes.gohugo.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">themes</a> — extremely minimalistic to fully loaded. You will always find the one for your liking there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>If you, like me, do not find one that ticks all the boxes for you, you can select any that is closest and get to personalising. All the themes come with the source code. So if it suits you, let the developer in you go wild.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>I began with a theme <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span><a href=\"https://themes.gohugo.io/ghostwriter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ghostwriter</a><span class=\"pull-double\">”</span>. It was simple and I could see how it can be extended to enable every aspect that I wanted to achieve. So I began working. After a week of customisation, I could finally see the site shaping up just the way I imagined.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p><del>I intend to soon open source the changes I have made to the original theme. I am working on cleaning up the source and committing.</del> All the enhancements and personalisations added to the theme are available at Github. If you like the theme that you see and if you are using Hugo for building your Static website, you can download and use the theme from <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/ghostwriter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"post-note\"} -->\n\n<p><p class=\"post-note\"><strong>TL;DR</strong>: The look and layout of this site is themed with an extremely <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/ghostwriter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">personalised and open-sourced port</a> of the original <span class=\"pull-single\">‘</span>ghostwriter’ theme. <del>I intend to open-source the same soon.</del></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n\n<p><h2 id=\"cushioning-against-brain-freeze\">Cushioning against brain freeze</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Yes. Commits and port. I am not letting another of my brain freeze moments to spoil all the efforts the put in over the years. Refer the history section I mentioned in my introduction above.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>So whole website is a git project. It is currently maintained as a private repository at <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a>. Every change, major or minor is committed. Every milestone is tagged as release. And every major enhancement is pull request. No, I am not taking any risk with myself this time. Here is a snapshot for the effort that has gone in to bring the v1 of this site.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3593,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n\n<p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"uploads/2020/5586b98e43.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3593\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Do I intend to make the source of this website public? Well, initially I wanted to do just that. However, I do want to keep my messy drafts, be it to the posts or the website, just to myself. I could not find a public way to achieve that. So as of now, the source stays private.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"post-note\"} -->\n\n<p><p class=\"post-note\"><strong>TL;DR</strong>: The source for the complete website along with all the posts, as markdown files, <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">resides in GitHub</a>. Every change to this setup is driven as it would be in a standard git project.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n\n<p><h2 id=\"migrating-the-content\">Migrating the content</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Talking about the posts, I had to bring the old entries along from Squarespace. After all, this is also a place for my writings. I would not want to loose any of my old ones<a id=\"ref-1DXK\" class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#footnote-1DXK\"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>This time, though, I did not have the luxury of the out-of-box imports. I had to do it on my own. Well, I did have a couple of points playing on my side.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n\n<p><ul><li>I have been writing all my posts in <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">markdown</a> format and exporting them as required.</li><li>Current setup with Hugo is all markdown driven, where every content exists as a <code>.md</code> file.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>So, all I had to do was find a way to export the content from Squarespace as markdown files. I wish it was that simple; it wasn’t. The only option that Squarespace supports for export is as a Wordpress package. However, anyone who has been blogging for even a slightest of time would know Wordpress package should be fine. Because there is nothing to be done with a Wordpress package that no one else has already tried. Just getting markdown files out of that must be a cakewalk. Markdown, after all, is a geek’s solution.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>And as I thought, it already is handled. <a href=\"https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ExitWP</a> is a great tool to migrate a Wordpress blog to a static site.

It’s difficult to beat all of that. <a href=\"#core-engine-hugo\">∞</a> <br><strong>2.</strong> The look and layout of this site is themed by an extremely personalised port of the original <span class=\"pull-single\">‘</span>ghostwriter’ theme.

Every change to this setup is driven as it would be in a standard git project. <a href=\"#cushioning-against-brain-freeze\">∞</a> <br><strong>4.</strong> Contents from Squarespace were exported into a Wordpress package first. They were converted into markdown files using ExitWP. Followed by cleanup. And deploy. <a href=\"#migrating-the-content\">∞</a> <br><strong>5.</strong> This site is deployed by Netlify. With continuous deployment and one-click <span class=\"small-caps\">SSL</span> for custom domains possible with minimum configuration, the choice was pretty simple. <a href=\"#deploying-with-netlify\">∞</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"core-engine---hugo\">Core Engine - Hugo</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had always wanted to attempt a site creation from scratch, but I failed miserably every single time. Given I had ample time before my Squarespace subscription expired, I attempted it again this time. I believe I did not fail. This is a static site, built with <a href=\"http://gohugo.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hugo</a>. It was the ease with which I could get a site running on my dev environment via Hugo that convinced me about the viability of this whole project. If you do not believe, just head over to the Hugo docs for a <em><a href=\"http://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quick start</a></em> and begin. You will have a site running by step two. It is that easy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You would have also realised how well document the whole framework is from your visit to the quick start guide. There is nothing that you want to achieve that isn’t documented. In addition, given that Hugo is written in <a href=\"https://golang.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GoLang</a>, it gave me an opportunity to learn a new language. Post that, every need of mine to get the things just right was just a code snippet away.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example, find below a snippet for fetching a list of random five articles. Yes, it is easy. And a lot powerful.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:preformatted -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&#123;&#123; $pag := where .Data.Pages \"type\" \"post\" } } &#123;&#123; range (shuffle $pag | first 5) } } &#123;&#123; ....custom.... } } &#123;&#123; end } }</pre>\n<!-- /wp:preformatted -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And if it does turn out that there is some tricky edge case that you just can’t get your head around (or you are being plain, simple lazy), there is a <a href=\"https://discourse.gohugo.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">thriving community</a> of fellow users which is extremely active and a lot helpful.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"post-note\"} -->\n<p class=\"post-note\"><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Hugo is simple, highly customisable, well documented and has an active community. It’s difficult to beat that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"personalising-the-look-layout\">Personalising the look & layout</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once I had the core finalised, I shifted my attention to personalising the site. And again Hugo comes with a lot of good looking <a href=\"http://themes.gohugo.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">themes</a> — extremely minimalistic to fully loaded. You will always find the one for your liking there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you, like me, do not find one that ticks all the boxes for you, you can select any that is closest and get to personalising. All the themes come with the source code. So if it suits you, let the developer in you go wild.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I began with a theme <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span><a href=\"https://themes.gohugo.io/ghostwriter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ghostwriter</a><span class=\"pull-double\">”</span>. It was simple and I could see how it can be extended to enable every aspect that I wanted to achieve. So I began working. After a week of customisation, I could finally see the site shaping up just the way I imagined.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><del>I intend to soon open source the changes I have made to the original theme. I am working on cleaning up the source and committing.</del> All the enhancements and personalisations added to the theme are available at Github. If you like the theme that you see and if you are using Hugo for building your Static website, you can download and use the theme from <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/ghostwriter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"post-note\"} -->\n<p class=\"post-note\"><strong>TL;DR</strong>: The look and layout of this site is themed with an extremely <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/ghostwriter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">personalised and open-sourced port</a> of the original <span class=\"pull-single\">‘</span>ghostwriter’ theme. <del>I intend to open-source the same soon.</del></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"cushioning-against-brain-freeze\">Cushioning against brain freeze</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yes. Commits and port. I am not letting another of my brain freeze moments to spoil all the efforts the put in over the years. Refer the history section I mentioned in my introduction above.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So whole website is a git project. It is currently maintained as a private repository at <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a>. Every change, major or minor is committed. Every milestone is tagged as release. And every major enhancement is pull request. No, I am not taking any risk with myself this time. Here is a snapshot for the effort that has gone in to bring the v1 of this site.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3593,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"uploads/2020/5586b98e43.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3593\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Do I intend to make the source of this website public? Well, initially I wanted to do just that. However, I do want to keep my messy drafts, be it to the posts or the website, just to myself. I could not find a public way to achieve that. So as of now, the source stays private.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"post-note\"} -->\n<p class=\"post-note\"><strong>TL;DR</strong>: The source for the complete website along with all the posts, as markdown files, <a href=\"https://github.com/am1t/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">resides in GitHub</a>.

After all, this is also a place for my writings. I would not want to loose any of my old ones<a id=\"ref-1DXK\" class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#footnote-1DXK\"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This time, though, I did not have the luxury of the out-of-box imports. I had to do it on my own. Well, I did have a couple of points playing on my side.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>I have been writing all my posts in <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">markdown</a> format and exporting them as required.</li><li>Current setup with Hugo is all markdown driven, where every content exists as a <code>.md</code> file.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, all I had to do was find a way to export the content from Squarespace as markdown files. I wish it was that simple; it wasn’t. The only option that Squarespace supports for export is as a Wordpress package. However, anyone who has been blogging for even a slightest of time would know Wordpress package should be fine. Because there is nothing to be done with a Wordpress package that no one else has already tried. Just getting markdown files out of that must be a cakewalk. Markdown, after all, is a geek’s solution.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And as I thought, it already is handled. <a href=\"https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ExitWP</a> is a great tool to migrate a Wordpress blog to a static site.

				"title": "Day When a Loan Shark Was Tamed",
				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/fc3dfcae1e.jpg\" alt=\"village-2\"></p> <p>Thursday dawned on Tikwadi. For an outsider, no dawn in Tikwadi was any different. Villagers idled around just the way they always did. Men meandered, dilly-dallying with some unknown angst. Women hustled helter-skelter, pretending to be busy with some unknown chore. And kids spurted kooky from all directions, engulfed with some unknown euphoria. But for a resident of Tikwadi, every day dawned with a new crazy chapter.</p> <p>Even today, a group of men squat around a smallish bonfire. They had Neem stems sticking out of their mouths; and hands, searching for heat, sticking out of their bodies. The chilly month of December always made them do such concoctions &#x2014; they were never sure which body part they wanted to heat by the bonfire and which one to keep warm in the cloak. Raghu and Ganya were doing nothing different.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>I heard Paka saw a ghost yesterday?&#x201D; queried Raghu.</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Where?&#x201D;</em> Ganya raised his brows.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>In his farm, it seems. He was returning from his evening choir. Got late. Heard he saw lights dancing in front of him.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>That idiot must have just seen some fireflies. Anyway, who did you hear it from?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Him.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Him Who?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Paka.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Who else did you hear it from?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>No one else. Why the fuck does that matter?&#x201D; Raghu bit on his Neem a bit too hard.</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Why would you say<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>you heard&#x201D; if the only person you heard it from was the one whom it happened to?&#x201D;</em></p> <p>Raghu spat a chunk of chewed Neem extracts &#x2014; the stem wasn&#x2019;t the only thing that was leaving a bitter taste in his mouth.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Fuck, is that Lala?&#x201D; he howled.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Why the hell is he out of his den?&#x201D;</p> <hr /> <p>Lala was horror personified. A moneylender by profession, and unlike the tradition of Tikwadi, he did not suck at lending money. After all, there are only so many ways someone can lend money. He did not lend money, he sentenced people to lending money from him. He would devise a ploy so intriguing that people just took money from him irrespective of their needs.</p> <p>Paka, <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/blog/the-lone-conductor\">the lone conductor of Tikwadi</a>, had fallen for a similar ploy. He once sat at the window of his bus with Lala next to him. He knew he should just keep his mouth shut and eyes focused on anything but the evil. There was a word around the town that Lala can taint one&#x2019;s brain with any opening he finds on your body. Paka did not want his brain to get spoilt; he pulled his beanie tighter over his ears.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>So where&#x2019;s the bus going?&#x201D; Lala began his session.</p> <p><em>Why the fuck does that matter? Where are you going, you devil?</em> Paka cursed in his mind. But he stayed inert, as if lifeless.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>You people controlling this bus are genius; it looks so old. It must be holding a world record for being the oldest bus plying on the road. Why do you still work, as in do a job?&#x201D; Paka looked at Lala with quizzing eyes. Strike one.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Why are you looking at me like that? For this alone, The Guinness Book of Records must have paid you a fortune, no?&#x201D; Paka, still mostly unmoved, had few frowning lines on his forehead. Strike two.</p> <p>Lala continued,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Now don&#x2019;t tell me you did not even apply for the Guinness records?&#x201D; Paka heard him. Strike three. Game over.</p> <hr /> <p>Of course, Lala did not suck at taking the money back from people. He was a ruthless maniac at that. So much so that there was a belief around the town that he had hollowed his cardiac chambers too&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;and used that space as safes for hiding people&#x2019;s documents.</p> <p>Both Raghu and Ganya owed him money. And neither could pay him back. So they stood up and started a brisk walk away from Lala. Lala, with his husky loud voice first, caught up to them in spite of an ancillary tummy dangling from his torso.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Stop. I am not here to ask money from you, you fools.&#x201D;</p> <p>Both Raghu and Ganya stopped.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Have you seen Paka around?&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Must be at his home.&#x201D; Raghu shot back.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>You think I did not try that? I went to his home and he is not there,&#x201D; Lala lambasted.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>No idea, in that case, about where he is. I did hear that he saw a ghost yesterday. So maybe he has run away from Tikwadi.&#x201D; Raghu informed.</p> <p>Ganya raised his eyebrows and howled,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Paka did not see any ghost, and this idiot did not hear it from anyone. He only heard it from Paka, or so he says.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Then why the fuck does he say that he heard?&#x201D; Lala shrieked. Ganya shrugged.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Anyway, I think he has a ghost living in his house itself,&#x201D; Lala theorised.</p> <p>Neither Raghu nor Ganya spoke a word. They just stared at Lala in an expectation that he might clarify this theory further.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>That lady living with him? She is no lesser that a witch.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Of course.&#x201D;</em> They spurted out exactly at the same time.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Indeed she is. What did she do now by the way?&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Well, I went there to ask my money back. That witch managed to pull another <span class=\"small-caps\">&#x20B9;100</span> from me. And also a monthly business, I am afraid&#x201D;</p> <p>Both Raghu and Ganya instantly flattened their hands to smash them together, all in full respect for this godly lady. Realising they have made Lala aware, they stopped. And gave him a puzzled look.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Don&#x2019;t ask. But hear me out anyway.&#x201D;</p> <hr /> <p>I reached Paka&#x2019;s house pretty early in the morning, I knew he always left his home early. But he had already left. He loves his bus more than his lady, I tell you.</p> <p>Anyway, I reach there and catch his wife squatting in her front-yard, milking her goats.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Howdy Bindu,&#x201D; I greet her and ask,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Where is Paka?&#x201D;</p> <p>She was startled as if no human had ever greeted her. So much so that she sprayed some milk on me. I felt even the goat looked at me and chuckled with a shake of her head.</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>He is not here&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;has left for work.&#x201D;</em> I saw a fly strolling over the craggy surface of her face.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>So early? Must be to his second wife, no?&#x201D; I attempted to crack a joke. She was not impressed. I attempted a cover-up,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-d\nouble\">&#x201C;</span>I mean his bus.&#x201D; Even the fly on her face need not change the course as it continued its trek.</p> <p>She howled, <em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>What do you want?&#x201D;</em> This time the fly did fly away.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>My money that Paka owes me.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>He has not left any money at home.&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Well, it has been very long since I have lent him the money. I won&#x2019;t go home empty-handed today,&#x201D; I looked around and pointed to the top subconsciously.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>I am taking your tin shelter.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Our house does not have any, you took away the last one last month. It is all grass and mud now. Take that if you want.&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Bah. What will I do with that?&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>How will I know? I do not do the business of selling mud and grass.&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Duh. Is there any idiot who does that?&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x201C;<em>Well, you sold us the mud and grass when you took our tins last time.&#x201D;</em> The goat shook her head again. I was not liking it one bit.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Whatever. I have come out of my house, I need to take something. Anything. Your goat. Aha. Yes, I will take your goat.&#x201D; The goat yawned and looked away. I am still not sure if it did that in fright or disgust.</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Ok, pay me <span class=\"small-caps\">&#x20B9;100</span> and take the goat away?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Tchah. Why the hell should I pay you anything?&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Well, it&#x2019;s your goat now. And I have just milked her,&#x201D;</em> she said pointing at the bucket full of milk. <em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>You will anyway take the milk too with you and sell it, making more moolah.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/fc3dfcae1e.jpg\" alt=\"village-2\"></p> <p>Thursday dawned on Tikwadi. For an outsider, no dawn in Tikwadi was any different. Villagers idled around just the way they always did. Men meandered, dilly-dallying with some unknown angst. Women hustled helter-skelter, pretending to be busy with some unknown chore. And kids spurted kooky from all directions, engulfed with some unknown euphoria. But for a resident of Tikwadi, every day dawned with a new crazy chapter.</p> <p>Even today, a group of men squat around a smallish bonfire. They had Neem stems sticking out of their mouths; and hands, searching for heat, sticking out of their bodies. The chilly month of December always made them do such concoctions &#x2014; they were never sure which body part they wanted to heat by the bonfire and which one to keep warm in the cloak. Raghu and Ganya were doing nothing different.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>I heard Paka saw a ghost yesterday?&#x201D; queried Raghu.</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Where?&#x201D;</em> Ganya raised his brows.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>In his farm, it seems. He was returning from his evening choir. Got late. Heard he saw lights dancing in front of him.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>That idiot must have just seen some fireflies. Anyway, who did you hear it from?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Him.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Him Who?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Paka.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Who else did you hear it from?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>No one else. Why the fuck does that matter?&#x201D; Raghu bit on his Neem a bit too hard.</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Why would you say<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>you heard&#x201D; if the only person you heard it from was the one whom it happened to?&#x201D;</em></p> <p>Raghu spat a chunk of chewed Neem extracts &#x2014; the stem wasn&#x2019;t the only thing that was leaving a bitter taste in his mouth.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Fuck, is that Lala?&#x201D; he howled.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Why the hell is he out of his den?&#x201D;</p> <hr /> <p>Lala was horror personified. A moneylender by profession, and unlike the tradition of Tikwadi, he did not suck at lending money. After all, there are only so many ways someone can lend money. He did not lend money, he sentenced people to lending money from him. He would devise a ploy so intriguing that people just took money from him irrespective of their needs.</p> <p>Paka, <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/blog/the-lone-conductor\">the lone conductor of Tikwadi</a>, had fallen for a similar ploy. He once sat at the window of his bus with Lala next to him. He knew he should just keep his mouth shut and eyes focused on anything but the evil. There was a word around the town that Lala can taint one&#x2019;s brain with any opening he finds on your body. Paka did not want his brain to get spoilt; he pulled his beanie tighter over his ears.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>So where&#x2019;s the bus going?&#x201D; Lala began his session.</p> <p><em>Why the fuck does that matter? Where are you going, you devil?</em> Paka cursed in his mind. But he stayed inert, as if lifeless.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>You people controlling this bus are genius; it looks so old. It must be holding a world record for being the oldest bus plying on the road. Why do you still work, as in do a job?&#x201D; Paka looked at Lala with quizzing eyes. Strike one.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Why are you looking at me like that? For this alone, The Guinness Book of Records must have paid you a fortune, no?&#x201D; Paka, still mostly unmoved, had few frowning lines on his forehead. Strike two.</p> <p>Lala continued,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Now don&#x2019;t tell me you did not even apply for the Guinness records?&#x201D; Paka heard him. Strike three. Game over.</p> <hr /> <p>Of course, Lala did not suck at taking the money back from people. He was a ruthless maniac at that. So much so that there was a belief around the town that he had hollowed his cardiac chambers too&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;and used that space as safes for hiding people&#x2019;s documents.</p> <p>Both Raghu and Ganya owed him money. And neither could pay him back. So they stood up and started a brisk walk away from Lala. Lala, with his husky loud voice first, caught up to them in spite of an ancillary tummy dangling from his torso.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Stop. I am not here to ask money from you, you fools.&#x201D;</p> <p>Both Raghu and Ganya stopped.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Have you seen Paka around?&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Must be at his home.&#x201D; Raghu shot back.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>You think I did not try that? I went to his home and he is not there,&#x201D; Lala lambasted.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>No idea, in that case, about where he is. I did hear that he saw a ghost yesterday. So maybe he has run away from Tikwadi.&#x201D; Raghu informed.</p> <p>Ganya raised his eyebrows and howled,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Paka did not see any ghost, and this idiot did not hear it from anyone. He only heard it from Paka, or so he says.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Then why the fuck does he say that he heard?&#x201D; Lala shrieked. Ganya shrugged.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Anyway, I think he has a ghost living in his house itself,&#x201D; Lala theorised.</p> <p>Neither Raghu nor Ganya spoke a word. They just stared at Lala in an expectation that he might clarify this theory further.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>That lady living with him? She is no lesser that a witch.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Of course.&#x201D;</em> They spurted out exactly at the same time.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Indeed she is. What did she do now by the way?&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Well, I went there to ask my money back. That witch managed to pull another <span class=\"small-caps\">&#x20B9;100</span> from me. And also a monthly business, I am afraid&#x201D;</p> <p>Both Raghu and Ganya instantly flattened their hands to smash them together, all in full respect for this godly lady. Realising they have made Lala aware, they stopped. And gave him a puzzled look.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Don&#x2019;t ask. But hear me out anyway.&#x201D;</p> <hr /> <p>I reached Paka&#x2019;s house pretty early in the morning, I knew he always left his home early. But he had already left. He loves his bus more than his lady, I tell you.</p> <p>Anyway, I reach there and catch his wife squatting in her front-yard, milking her goats.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Howdy Bindu,&#x201D; I greet her and ask,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Where is Paka?&#x201D;</p> <p>She was startled as if no human had ever greeted her. So much so that she sprayed some milk on me. I felt even the goat looked at me and chuckled with a shake of her head.</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>He is not here&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;has left for work.&#x201D;</em> I saw a fly strolling over the craggy surface of her face.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>So early? Must be to his second wife, no?&#x201D; I attempted to crack a joke. She was not impressed. I attempted a cover-up,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-d\nouble\">&#x201C;</span>I mean his bus.&#x201D; Even the fly on her face need not change the course as it continued its trek.</p> <p>She howled, <em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>What do you want?&#x201D;</em> This time the fly did fly away.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>My money that Paka owes me.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>He has not left any money at home.&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Well, it has been very long since I have lent him the money. I won&#x2019;t go home empty-handed today,&#x201D; I looked around and pointed to the top subconsciously.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>I am taking your tin shelter.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Our house does not have any, you took away the last one last month. It is all grass and mud now. Take that if you want.&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Bah. What will I do with that?&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>How will I know? I do not do the business of selling mud and grass.&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Duh. Is there any idiot who does that?&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x201C;<em>Well, you sold us the mud and grass when you took our tins last time.&#x201D;</em> The goat shook her head again. I was not liking it one bit.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Whatever. I have come out of my house, I need to take something. Anything. Your goat. Aha. Yes, I will take your goat.&#x201D; The goat yawned and looked away. I am still not sure if it did that in fright or disgust.</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Ok, pay me <span class=\"small-caps\">&#x20B9;100</span> and take the goat away?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Tchah. Why the hell should I pay you anything?&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Well, it&#x2019;s your goat now. And I have just milked her,&#x201D;</em> she said pointing at the bucket full of milk. <em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>You will anyway take the milk too with you and sell it, making more moolah. So you owe me a <span class=\"small-caps\">&#x20B9;100</span> for my service.&#x201D;</em></p> <p>The goat bleated, mocking me.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Ok.

Om tried to read Pia’s face, but it was still as a calm sea — there was some movement, but he could not gather what was to come.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>You are the one person I need to have around me for life, else my life would be a total mess. With you not around, everything was amiss. Well, I may not be the most handsome guy out there. I may not be one of the richest, the smartest guys out there. But..”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The sound from another firework muffled Om’s next words. He cursed the timing, he did not want his last words to linger around any longer. So he attempted to override the effect the firework had.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>But I am confident that I will be the one person that will care for you more than anyone has ever cared for someone else.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Om paused to let the words sink, to see if they had any effect on Pia. She stayed unmoved. He continued, dejection apparent in his voice, <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Last 6 months have, professionally, been the most fruitful ones for me, but I wasn’t happy. Because I could not share the joy with you. I had the world to cheer me Pia, but I was crying inside.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Firework lit the skies again — this time, Om appreciated the timing. Pia had been looking at her toes for quite some time, digging the dirt out. As the firework was dying down, Om felt he saw a shimmer of a drop leave Pia’s eye and collapse.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>And as I stand here on the verge of sending you off to another country, another world, I can’t imagine what my life would be without you around, ever.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Om could hear Pia whimper, but he persisted, <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>It would be empty, and I have seen my empty heart bleed. If you leave today, you will leave my life empty, hollow. You have always been my <em>Dorothy</em> since that first night out. You complete me, Pia. And..”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Yes,”</em> emerged a sound amidst the sobs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The word that he thought he heard leave Pia’s mouth left Om perplexed. <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>What? I don’t&nbsp;..”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Shut up you fool. Here’s <em>your</em> Dorothy saying <em>You had me at <span class=\"pull-single\">‘</span>hello’</em>.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many fireworks engulfed the stars in the night sky. The only thing left gleaming were the tears rolling down Pia’s cheeks as she collapsed in Om’s arms.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This story was first <a href=\"https://theweeklyknob.com/till-the-fireworks-last-41cfb4007d1f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">published</a> at Medium as part of the publication <a href=\"https://theweeklyknob.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Weekly Knob</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

There is no haste in revealing the past or bumping into Ove&#x2019;s future. Every chapter, a short story in itself, unfolds more of Ove and the world around him. You see Ove as he is. You are slowly led to understand why he is the way he is, mostly via flashbacks. You are made to feel for the guy, made to root for him to not stay how he is. And when that happens, because you are already absorbed into Ove&#x2019;s life, you are left contented.</p> <p>Saying Ove is grumpy would be an understatement. He is on the edge always, ready to get worked up. He is disappointed in everyone around him. He feels no one is responsible enough to care for oneself - dependent on others for every little thing. He feels the world around has no respect for rules of the land, doesn&#x2019;t matter they are chalked out by Ove himself. So he takes it upon himself to make sure people are constantly reminded of that. And that&#x2019;s how he lives his life - a monotonous, misanthropic one&#xA0;. And as Ove is planning to end his troubles with his life, fate has just the opposite planned for him &#x2014; to add just enough goodness in Ove&#x2019;s life to thaw the bitterness.</p> <p>The book maintains a wry sense of humor throughout. It made me laugh out loud at multiple instances. Especially, the way Ove&#x2019;s frustrations in other people&#x2019;s incompetence are worded is an absolute masterclass. The book also maintains a deep sad undertone. It does not ever let Ove&#x2019;s sulkiness make you hate him.</p> <p>So be it through his affection towards a young boy in love or forced, but welcome attachment from the lively new neighbor or the unspoken responsibility towards the old, and may be the only friend, Ove always shows just enough warmth to make him the most likable character in a long long time. Or in Sonja, Ove&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s words,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span><em>the strangest superhero I have ever heard about</em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span>.</p> <p>Go welcome this guy, and the gang, into your life.

He had dusted them just an hour back, but he still found some dust on his hands. He wiggled his hands and muttered few muffled swears towards the polluting city dwellers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>He went to the wash basin, took some liquid soap from the dispenser he had just refilled and washed off the dust. As a matter of fact, the dispenser did not need a refill. But a routine was the only thing that kept Oas’s life rolling. So refilling soap dispensers was one of his Sunday morning’s routine chore. As was dusting the furniture and curtains.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>He was also particular at being absolutely certain about things. So he washed his hands off again a couple of times.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>He realised he had forgotten to peek outside when we had slid the curtains aside, well, to peek outside. He also realised that not enough dust had stuck to his hands earlier to make the curtains clean. So he reached closer to the windows and gazed fixedly at the curtains as if he possessed some superpower to wipe things clean just by his stare. He wished he did. He did not.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>He wanted to check the weather outside, of course without letting his hands be all dusty. So he pulled an old umbrella from the cabinet and poked at the curtains, as if he was worried that the dust particles were monsters hiding behind, ready to pounce on him. He wished they were. They were not.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Once he was convinced that nothing will pounce on him, he used the same umbrella to slide the curtains to the side and swiftly moved closer to the window to peek outside. He instantly tumbled backwards as he saw two green shaken eyes gawking back at him. Some more muffled swear words left Oas’ mouth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Oas saw the shaken eyes come back to their sleepy normal — one eye open three-fourth, another the remaining one-fourth. Both belonged to one lazy creature dwelling in their block. Oas’ neighbours called it a cat — he called it Mr.&nbsp;Boneless Marvel. <em><span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Marvel it is — given it belonged to no one, no one freaking cared about pets in our block and it was too lazy assed to care about itself. Still, I have never seen it lose a sliver of weight. Phenomenon. Prodigy. Miracle.”</em> Oas always advocated his case to Sara.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Mr.&nbsp;Marvel had a total of half eyes open now looking at Oas, chin strongly pinned on its paw. Oas attempted to shoo it away with the umbrella. It winked back at him. Oas attempted it a couple more times. It winked back a couple more times. Oas slid the curtain closed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>He again realised he did not peek outside for the weather, so he slid the curtain open, ignored Mr.&nbsp;Marvel and checked the weather outside, finally.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Oas saw a grumpy old man peering back at him in the mirror. There were so many things Sara would not like in what reflected back. So he straightened his eyebrows, opened his eyes wide, curved his lips up into a pleasant smile and slowly flattened the visible creases on his sweater. He wished somewhere deep inside he could do the same for the wrinkles on his forehead. And the ones on his nose too. He couldn’t. So his face went back to be being grumpy again.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>He could be his grumpy self for some more time. As per the Sunday routine, he still had an hour to ready himself for Sara.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>He finally walked outside, locked the door behind him and, of course, tugged at it a couple of times. He realised something, muttered few muffled swears again, unlocked the door and brought an umbrella back with him. He knew it would rain soon.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>He started ambling towards the bus stop. As he did every Sunday, he stopped next to the electronics store and inspected himself in the glass at the store front to make sure he was ready for Sara. Today, he saw Mr.&nbsp;Marvel standing next to him. He tried to recall last time he had seen it standing. He could not, so he started walking. So did it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Oas wasn’t sure why it was following him. He shrieked, <em><span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>go away, shoo”</em> waving his hand. It blinked. He wielded his umbrella almost touching its nose. It stopped, purred, licked its grey moustache and looked back at him, winking. He gave up and started walking, holding his shoulder to abate the pain from all his freakish <em>swordplay</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Oas sat on the bench at the nearest bus stop.

He had dusted them just an hour back, but he still found some dust on his hands. He wiggled his hands and muttered few muffled swears towards the polluting city dwellers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He went to the wash basin, took some liquid soap from the dispenser he had just refilled and washed off the dust. As a matter of fact, the dispenser did not need a refill. But a routine was the only thing that kept Oas’s life rolling. So refilling soap dispensers was one of his Sunday morning’s routine chore. As was dusting the furniture and curtains.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He was also particular at being absolutely certain about things. So he washed his hands off again a couple of times.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He realised he had forgotten to peek outside when we had slid the curtains aside, well, to peek outside. He also realised that not enough dust had stuck to his hands earlier to make the curtains clean. So he reached closer to the windows and gazed fixedly at the curtains as if he possessed some superpower to wipe things clean just by his stare. He wished he did. He did not.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He wanted to check the weather outside, of course without letting his hands be all dusty. So he pulled an old umbrella from the cabinet and poked at the curtains, as if he was worried that the dust particles were monsters hiding behind, ready to pounce on him. He wished they were. They were not.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once he was convinced that nothing will pounce on him, he used the same umbrella to slide the curtains to the side and swiftly moved closer to the window to peek outside. He instantly tumbled backwards as he saw two green shaken eyes gawking back at him. Some more muffled swear words left Oas’ mouth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Oas saw the shaken eyes come back to their sleepy normal — one eye open three-fourth, another the remaining one-fourth. Both belonged to one lazy creature dwelling in their block. Oas’ neighbours called it a cat — he called it Mr.&nbsp;Boneless Marvel. <em><span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Marvel it is — given it belonged to no one, no one freaking cared about pets in our block and it was too lazy assed to care about itself. Still, I have never seen it lose a sliver of weight. Phenomenon. Prodigy. Miracle.”</em> Oas always advocated his case to Sara.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mr.&nbsp;Marvel had a total of half eyes open now looking at Oas, chin strongly pinned on its paw. Oas attempted to shoo it away with the umbrella. It winked back at him. Oas attempted it a couple more times. It winked back a couple more times. Oas slid the curtain closed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He again realised he did not peek outside for the weather, so he slid the curtain open, ignored Mr.&nbsp;Marvel and checked the weather outside, finally.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Oas saw a grumpy old man peering back at him in the mirror. There were so many things Sara would not like in what reflected back. So he straightened his eyebrows, opened his eyes wide, curved his lips up into a pleasant smile and slowly flattened the visible creases on his sweater. He wished somewhere deep inside he could do the same for the wrinkles on his forehead. And the ones on his nose too. He couldn’t. So his face went back to be being grumpy again.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He could be his grumpy self for some more time. As per the Sunday routine, he still had an hour to ready himself for Sara.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He finally walked outside, locked the door behind him and, of course, tugged at it a couple of times. He realised something, muttered few muffled swears again, unlocked the door and brought an umbrella back with him. He knew it would rain soon.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He started ambling towards the bus stop. As he did every Sunday, he stopped next to the electronics store and inspected himself in the glass at the store front to make sure he was ready for Sara. Today, he saw Mr.&nbsp;Marvel standing next to him. He tried to recall last time he had seen it standing. He could not, so he started walking. So did it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Oas wasn’t sure why it was following him. He shrieked, <em><span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>go away, shoo”</em> waving his hand. It blinked. He wielded his umbrella almost touching its nose. It stopped, purred, licked its grey moustache and looked back at him, winking. He gave up and started walking, holding his shoulder to abate the pain from all his freakish <em>swordplay</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Oas sat on the bench at the nearest bus stop.

				"content_html": "<p>It was pitch dark across the town of Diu. The street winding down was deserted as usual. It had recently been washed off its weariness by the unseasonal rain. In a way, it was a perfect setting for one pleasant, romantic walk.</p> <p>A couple silhouetted against the discontinuous bouts of illumination from the lighthouse nearby. But their walk was no way romantic, may be a tad tipsy rather.</p> <p>Roy and Joel had been walking down the street for almost an hour. Yet their individual opinions were divided. Joel thought it must have been four hours. Roy, however, opined that he was off by at least 3 hours and 30 minutes.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>No way&#x201D; bawled Joel,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>We must be just debating this for last 2 hours.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Again, you are off by an hour and 30 minutes at the least&#x201D; Roy countered.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>How are you so sure? It&#x2019;s as if you want to stay here longer.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Of course, I do. Don&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Well, not in the shape I am now&#x201D; Joel hit back with his fiery eyes.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Anyway, shouldn&#x2019;t we be searching for what we are supposed to search?&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>That is exactly what I am doing&#x201D; replied Roy, peeking at the byroad they were passing by.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>I don&#x2019;t think we are searching for the same thing, though. If that were the case, you would be peeping minutely down the manholes. Not glancing at the lanes as we pass by.&#x201D;</p> <p>Roy just smiled.</p> <hr /> <p>Ganu saw the two bodies tottering along. He wasn&#x2019;t sure if it was their walk or his drunk vision that was unsteady.</p> <p>One was looking minutely at the footpaths, and in the garbage bins, and over the plant pots. He thought he also saw him once peeping inside a manhole. He was for sure searching for something.</p> <p>The other, the skinny one, was not searching for any <em>thing</em>, though.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span><em>He might well be searching for someone.</em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span> thought Ganu.</p> <p>There was something about these two people that appeared odd to Ganu. They looked unconventionally fresh for the time of the day, the season of the year, and the condition of the city. All were in shambles.</p> <p>Ganu did not like such clean people. He felt no one should be this clean when he was drowning in his sorrows.</p> <p>Ganu started following them.</p> <hr /> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>I think that guy there is following us. Is it ok if he sees us?&#x201D; asked Joel, in a worried tone.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>How would I know? I too am going through this for the first time. I, anyway, do not think anyone ever has faced this. I think even he would not know.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Of course, he would know. He is the one who sets the rules.&#x201D;</p> <p>Roy shushed Joel as he heard the muffled voices, the wailings.

Let&#x2019;s go search for that key to the heavens.&#x201D;</p>\n",
				"content_text": "<p>It was pitch dark across the town of Diu. The street winding down was deserted as usual. It had recently been washed off its weariness by the unseasonal rain. In a way, it was a perfect setting for one pleasant, romantic walk.</p> <p>A couple silhouetted against the discontinuous bouts of illumination from the lighthouse nearby. But their walk was no way romantic, may be a tad tipsy rather.</p> <p>Roy and Joel had been walking down the street for almost an hour. Yet their individual opinions were divided. Joel thought it must have been four hours. Roy, however, opined that he was off by at least 3 hours and 30 minutes.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>No way&#x201D; bawled Joel,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>We must be just debating this for last 2 hours.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Again, you are off by an hour and 30 minutes at the least&#x201D; Roy countered.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>How are you so sure? It&#x2019;s as if you want to stay here longer.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Of course, I do. Don&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Well, not in the shape I am now&#x201D; Joel hit back with his fiery eyes.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Anyway, shouldn&#x2019;t we be searching for what we are supposed to search?&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>That is exactly what I am doing&#x201D; replied Roy, peeking at the byroad they were passing by.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>I don&#x2019;t think we are searching for the same thing, though. If that were the case, you would be peeping minutely down the manholes. Not glancing at the lanes as we pass by.&#x201D;</p> <p>Roy just smiled.</p> <hr /> <p>Ganu saw the two bodies tottering along. He wasn&#x2019;t sure if it was their walk or his drunk vision that was unsteady.</p> <p>One was looking minutely at the footpaths, and in the garbage bins, and over the plant pots. He thought he also saw him once peeping inside a manhole. He was for sure searching for something.</p> <p>The other, the skinny one, was not searching for any <em>thing</em>, though.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span><em>He might well be searching for someone.</em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span> thought Ganu.</p> <p>There was something about these two people that appeared odd to Ganu. They looked unconventionally fresh for the time of the day, the season of the year, and the condition of the city. All were in shambles.</p> <p>Ganu did not like such clean people. He felt no one should be this clean when he was drowning in his sorrows.</p> <p>Ganu started following them.</p> <hr /> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>I think that guy there is following us. Is it ok if he sees us?&#x201D; asked Joel, in a worried tone.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>How would I know? I too am going through this for the first time. I, anyway, do not think anyone ever has faced this. I think even he would not know.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Of course, he would know. He is the one who sets the rules.&#x201D;</p> <p>Roy shushed Joel as he heard the muffled voices, the wailings. He walked towards the next alley&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;there was a gathering of saddened souls.</p> <p>Roy just smiled, again.</p> <hr /> <p>Ganu walked behind them to the crowd and steered himself towards the middle.

				"content_html": "<p>Today&#x2019;s was a typical summer morning in Tikwadi. It was a calm &amp; pleasant dawn that the midnight breeze &amp; the sun-beaten land had hatched together. And like <em>every</em> typical morning&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;summer, winter or of the rainy season&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Paka sat expressionless at the window seat of his bus. His bus it was, as he was the lone conductor available in the village.</p> <p>It would not have been the case in reality though, if not for Paka. He was just smart enough to convince <em>those who appointed a conductor</em> that no person there was suitable for the job. He also convinced <em>those who wanted to get appointed as one</em> that no job there was suitable for the person.</p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>What to do? It is a selfish world out there.&#x201D; He used to say as he accepted the job&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;making him evidently look selfless.</p> <p>And <em>keeping his job as a conductor intact</em> was the only job he ever worked on. As long as he did that well, all he had to do was report to the bus depot every morning, sit at his window seat through the day and get dropped at his home at night.</p> <p>Paka had also mastered the skill of acting dumb&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;something he, of course, was not, given the fact that he had managed to keep the whole village away from his job for 5 years now. Every time someone reminded him of the work he has to do as a conductor, he would work hard to screw up hardest. He considered screwing intermittently as the part-time job, holding onto it being the primary one.</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Why don&#x2019;t you ever count the money collected?&#x201D;</em> An officer had once asked him. <em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Tomorrow, you bring it as counted.&#x201D;</em></p> <p>He reported to the officer next day with no money with him.</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Did no one travel on the bus today?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>They did. But you told me to count. I counted. I put every rupee note I received next to me in a separate pile based on their value&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;as I was taught counting in school. It seems the notes blow away if not held.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>But then why didn&#x2019;t you hold them?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Well, I can either hold the money or count it, right? I only have two hands.&#x201D;</p> <p>The officer had received <span class=\"small-caps\">&#x20B9;700</span> less in his next salary.</p> <p>And no one dared to question Paka&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;he used to yell<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Well, find someone else suitable for this job&#x201D;. Of course, he would then be asked to simply do nothing.<br /> In that sense, he was paid to not work. Lesser he moved from his seat, more he not worked&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;more he not worked, more he was paid.</p> <hr /> <p>Not that everyone in Tikwadi was stupid, though. It was just that every individual was a master at being a fool at their work.</p> <p>Farmers sucked at farming. Carpenters sucked at carpentry. Potters sucked at pottery. Barbers sucked at <em>barbery</em>. The only people that did not suck at their jobs were operators of the water pumps. They never sucked, anything.</p> <p>Paka met all these people during the rides on his bus. And he dreaded every interaction he had with these fools out in the village.</p> <hr /> <p>Today, Paka saw Gotya coming towards his bus. He sighed. He dreaded meeting Gotya the most. Gotya was a herder. Of course, he sucked at herding his goats. But that was not why Paka dreaded him. Gotya was one of the most foolish ones out there &amp; he made Paka work like no one ever did.</p> <p>He knew it was going to be a hectic day for him.</p> <p>Gotya hopped onto the bus. <em>And so did his five goats after him.</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Goats are not allowed on the bus.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Where is it written?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Here&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;right above me.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>You know I can&#x2019;t read, right?

He considered screwing intermittently as the part-time job, holding onto it being the primary one.</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Why don&#x2019;t you ever count the money collected?&#x201D;</em> An officer had once asked him. <em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Tomorrow, you bring it as counted.&#x201D;</em></p> <p>He reported to the officer next day with no money with him.</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Did no one travel on the bus today?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>They did. But you told me to count. I counted. I put every rupee note I received next to me in a separate pile based on their value&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;as I was taught counting in school. It seems the notes blow away if not held.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>But then why didn&#x2019;t you hold them?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Well, I can either hold the money or count it, right? I only have two hands.&#x201D;</p> <p>The officer had received <span class=\"small-caps\">&#x20B9;700</span> less in his next salary.</p> <p>And no one dared to question Paka&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;he used to yell<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Well, find someone else suitable for this job&#x201D;. Of course, he would then be asked to simply do nothing.<br /> In that sense, he was paid to not work. Lesser he moved from his seat, more he not worked&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;more he not worked, more he was paid.</p> <hr /> <p>Not that everyone in Tikwadi was stupid, though. It was just that every individual was a master at being a fool at their work.</p> <p>Farmers sucked at farming. Carpenters sucked at carpentry. Potters sucked at pottery. Barbers sucked at <em>barbery</em>. The only people that did not suck at their jobs were operators of the water pumps. They never sucked, anything.</p> <p>Paka met all these people during the rides on his bus. And he dreaded every interaction he had with these fools out in the village.</p> <hr /> <p>Today, Paka saw Gotya coming towards his bus. He sighed. He dreaded meeting Gotya the most. Gotya was a herder. Of course, he sucked at herding his goats. But that was not why Paka dreaded him. Gotya was one of the most foolish ones out there &amp; he made Paka work like no one ever did.</p> <p>He knew it was going to be a hectic day for him.</p> <p>Gotya hopped onto the bus. <em>And so did his five goats after him.</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Goats are not allowed on the bus.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Where is it written?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Here&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;right above me.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>You know I can&#x2019;t read, right?

				"title": "Why Gender Equality is important for men too",
				"content_html": "<p><p>Emma Watson gave an impassioned and effective speech at the U.N. headquarters in New York. The address was as part of the launch of <a href=\"http://www.heforshe.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>HeForShe&#x201D; campaign</a>.</p> <p>Overall speech from the U.N. Women Goodwill Ambassador is a must watch &#x2014; not only for the fact that it was highly applauded &amp; admired, but for a fresh view towards Feminism.</p> <p>I was especially gratified to hear her speak on why gender equality is an issue, and a cause of concern, for men too.</p> <blockquote> <p>Gender equality is your issue too. Because to-date, I have seen my father&#x2019;s role as a parent being valued less by the society &#x2014; despite my needing his presence as a child as much as my mother&#x2019;s. I&#x2019;ve seen men suffering from mental illness unable to ask for help for fear it will make them less of man.(&#x2026;) I have seen men made fragile and insecure by distorted sense of what constitutes male success.<br /> <br /> Men don&#x2019;t have the benefits of equality either. We don&#x2019;t talk often about men being imprisoned by gender stereotypes. But they are. And when they are free, things will change for women as a natural consequence.<br /> <br /> If men don&#x2019;t have to be aggressive in order to be accepted, women won&#x2019;t feel compelled to be submissive. If men don&#x2019;t have to control, women won&#x2019;t have to be controlled. Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive.

Women Goodwill Ambassador is a must watch &#x2014; not only for the fact that it was highly applauded &amp; admired, but for a fresh view towards Feminism.</p> <p>I was especially gratified to hear her speak on why gender equality is an issue, and a cause of concern, for men too.</p> <blockquote> <p>Gender equality is your issue too. Because to-date, I have seen my father&#x2019;s role as a parent being valued less by the society &#x2014; despite my needing his presence as a child as much as my mother&#x2019;s. I&#x2019;ve seen men suffering from mental illness unable to ask for help for fear it will make them less of man.(&#x2026;) I have seen men made fragile and insecure by distorted sense of what constitutes male success.<br /> <br /> Men don&#x2019;t have the benefits of equality either. We don&#x2019;t talk often about men being imprisoned by gender stereotypes. But they are. And when they are free, things will change for women as a natural consequence.<br /> <br /> If men don&#x2019;t have to be aggressive in order to be accepted, women won&#x2019;t feel compelled to be submissive. If men don&#x2019;t have to control, women won&#x2019;t have to be controlled. Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong.<br /> <br /> It is time we all <em>perceive gender on a spectrum instead of two sets of opposing ideals</em>.

Well, can you blame the poor souls who are made to remember the crazy letters every time they want to get something done online? Moreover, they are forced, as a security policy, to change and then remember the new passwords every some time. Sigh! Indeed, passwords are mess.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>You need more proof? Try searching for the phrase <a href=\"http://www.bing.com/search?q=passwords+should+die\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“passwords should die”</a>.

The problem is such machine generated passwords are usually random Strings; hence they are extremely hard to memorise. Good password managers <a href=\"https://diogomonica.com/posts/password-security-why-the-horse-battery-staple-is-not-correct/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">can negate</a> that need. However, they become a hinderance in an environment where there are multiple machines involved (for example, work vs home environment). Moreover, the security aspect of these are <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/7/4597018/google-chrome-saved-browser-passwords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hotly debated topics</a>.</li><li>Recommend ways for <strong>easy to remember, difficult to break</strong> passwords: An option that is evaluated a lot these days. The xkcd post linked above recommended one such way. It also opened a lot of threads <a href=\"http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/6095/xkcd-936-short-complex-password-or-long-dictionary-passphrase\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">discussing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/936:_Password_Strength\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">analysing</a> the accuracy and feasibility of the same. There were <a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/security/how-to/a8650/solving-the-password-problem-14993917/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">articles</a> and <a href=\"http://www.isi.edu/natural-language/mt/memorize-random-60.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">papers</a> written on understanding and improving on the suggested way. The problem is, eventually, it is a human, the lazy ass, who will decide what the password would be. What would end up happening is instead of <em>”password1”</em> being a common password, it would be <em>”mypasswodiscommon”</em>.</li><li>Go <strong>Biometric</strong>: Apple introduced a working and, debatably, secure implementation of biometric authentication in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_ID\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TouchId</a>. By bundling it as a core feature of iPhone, Apple made it reach to the masses. <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/fingerprints-as-passwords-new-iphone-touch-id-gets-mixed-security-verdict/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tons</a> of <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/09/will-apples-touch-id-make-fingerprints-happen.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">articles</a> were written detailing how it can solve the password problem altogether. Though possible, issue remains this would not happen until biometric authentication comes bundled across all technology devices, <em>even the low-end mobile phones</em>. Passwords remain the standard, and only acceptable authentication method till then.</li><li>Make <strong>passwords die</strong>, altogether: Finally, we come to the most interesting option that can be driven by the application developers themselves and not the users of the application. I feel, this will eventually become a reality.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n\n<p><h3 id=\"passwordlessauthentication\">Password-less Authentication</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>A lot has been said on this front too. There are <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ninjudd/passwords-are-obsolete-9ed56d483eb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">articles</a> and even open source frameworks, like <a href=\"https://passwordless.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Passwordless</a> that want to target this by providing application developers ways to replace their login forms with password-less access. At high-level, key steps involved to achieve this are</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n\n<p><ul><li>Make a user just mention his userid/email address</li><li>Generate a one-time token for him</li><li>Deliver it to him</li><li>Authenticate him with the generated token</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>These are pretty standard and well accepted steps. However the issue remains in the 3rd step, <em>how should these tokens be delivered</em>. Whichever mechanism one selects will become <em>the single point of threat</em> to the whole system going haywire, be it then email (<em>what’s the password for email account then?</em>) or SMS (<em>phone is lost, what now?</em>). The <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4308190\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hacker news thread</a> on <a href=\"http://notes.xoxco.com/post/27999787765/is-it-time-for-password-less-login\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">one such suggested system</a> is nice rundown for the probable issues.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Now that thread is more than a couple of years old. Today, the best option would be to deliver the token to the device which has biometric authentication enabled. As an example, I really like the way Apple has enabled the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204152\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">two-factor authentication</a> on Apple Id. It displays possible devices where the token can be delivered and asks the user to select one. Once delivered to, say, an iPhone, <em>only the user who owns the iPhone</em> can access it by authenticating himself with TouchId. This same mechanism can be applied for delivering the secure tokens of web/mobile applications too. There, the delivery problem is solved.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>However, given that majority of the users do not own an iPhone or a similar biometric authentication enabled device, this method cannot become the primary way of authenticating users.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>So even though I believe that, in <a href=\"http://hypercritical.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">John Siracusa’</a> words, <em>on an infinite timescale</em>, all applications will have password-less logins, we are some years away from realising that dream.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Ok, so what till then? This is what I would like the applications developers to do to make this password mess a bit less itchy for me. Decide first, do you really need me to secure my profile via a password? User forums/discussion groups, I am looking at you. I will give leeway to banks/financial apps to make me remember and enter the password. For all others, please make this process simple.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n\n<p><ol><li>When a user visits the first time, ask for his email id/mobile number.

Well, can you blame the poor souls who are made to remember the crazy letters every time they want to get something done online? Moreover, they are forced, as a security policy, to change and then remember the new passwords every some time. Sigh! Indeed, passwords are mess.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You need more proof? Try searching for the phrase <a href=\"http://www.bing.com/search?q=passwords+should+die\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“passwords should die”</a>. This farce has to be one of the most cursed phenomenon out there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"butthenwhataretheoptions\">But then what are the options?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>Make browsers/OS’es handle the <strong>password generation and management</strong>: This is one of the oldest and most recommended solution for this issue. The problem is such machine generated passwords are usually random Strings; hence they are extremely hard to memorise. Good password managers <a href=\"https://diogomonica.com/posts/password-security-why-the-horse-battery-staple-is-not-correct/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">can negate</a> that need. However, they become a hinderance in an environment where there are multiple machines involved (for example, work vs home environment). Moreover, the security aspect of these are <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/7/4597018/google-chrome-saved-browser-passwords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hotly debated topics</a>.</li><li>Recommend ways for <strong>easy to remember, difficult to break</strong> passwords: An option that is evaluated a lot these days. The xkcd post linked above recommended one such way. It also opened a lot of threads <a href=\"http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/6095/xkcd-936-short-complex-password-or-long-dictionary-passphrase\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">discussing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/936:_Password_Strength\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">analysing</a> the accuracy and feasibility of the same. There were <a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/security/how-to/a8650/solving-the-password-problem-14993917/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">articles</a> and <a href=\"http://www.isi.edu/natural-language/mt/memorize-random-60.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">papers</a> written on understanding and improving on the suggested way. The problem is, eventually, it is a human, the lazy ass, who will decide what the password would be. What would end up happening is instead of <em>”password1”</em> being a common password, it would be <em>”mypasswodiscommon”</em>.</li><li>Go <strong>Biometric</strong>: Apple introduced a working and, debatably, secure implementation of biometric authentication in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_ID\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TouchId</a>. By bundling it as a core feature of iPhone, Apple made it reach to the masses. <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/fingerprints-as-passwords-new-iphone-touch-id-gets-mixed-security-verdict/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tons</a> of <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/09/will-apples-touch-id-make-fingerprints-happen.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">articles</a> were written detailing how it can solve the password problem altogether. Though possible, issue remains this would not happen until biometric authentication comes bundled across all technology devices, <em>even the low-end mobile phones</em>. Passwords remain the standard, and only acceptable authentication method till then.</li><li>Make <strong>passwords die</strong>, altogether: Finally, we come to the most interesting option that can be driven by the application developers themselves and not the users of the application. I feel, this will eventually become a reality.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"passwordlessauthentication\">Password-less Authentication</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A lot has been said on this front too. There are <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ninjudd/passwords-are-obsolete-9ed56d483eb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">articles</a> and even open source frameworks, like <a href=\"https://passwordless.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Passwordless</a> that want to target this by providing application developers ways to replace their login forms with password-less access. At high-level, key steps involved to achieve this are</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Make a user just mention his userid/email address</li><li>Generate a one-time token for him</li><li>Deliver it to him</li><li>Authenticate him with the generated token</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These are pretty standard and well accepted steps. However the issue remains in the 3rd step, <em>how should these tokens be delivered</em>. Whichever mechanism one selects will become <em>the single point of threat</em> to the whole system going haywire, be it then email (<em>what’s the password for email account then?</em>) or SMS (<em>phone is lost, what now?</em>). The <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4308190\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hacker news thread</a> on <a href=\"http://notes.xoxco.com/post/27999787765/is-it-time-for-password-less-login\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">one such suggested system</a> is nice rundown for the probable issues.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that thread is more than a couple of years old. Today, the best option would be to deliver the token to the device which has biometric authentication enabled. As an example, I really like the way Apple has enabled the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204152\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">two-factor authentication</a> on Apple Id. It displays possible devices where the token can be delivered and asks the user to select one. Once delivered to, say, an iPhone, <em>only the user who owns the iPhone</em> can access it by authenticating himself with TouchId. This same mechanism can be applied for delivering the secure tokens of web/mobile applications too. There, the delivery problem is solved.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, given that majority of the users do not own an iPhone or a similar biometric authentication enabled device, this method cannot become the primary way of authenticating users.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So even though I believe that, in <a href=\"http://hypercritical.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">John Siracusa’</a> words, <em>on an infinite timescale</em>, all applications will have password-less logins, we are some years away from realising that dream.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ok, so what till then? This is what I would like the applications developers to do to make this password mess a bit less itchy for me. Decide first, do you really need me to secure my profile via a password? User forums/discussion groups, I am looking at you. I will give leeway to banks/financial apps to make me remember and enter the password. For all others, please make this process simple.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>When a user visits the first time, ask for his email id/mobile number.

Thomas has done a great job <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1019162825\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reviewing</a> this at Goodreads. Here&#x2019;s how he describes the style of prose in the novel, the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>survival&#x201D; journey of Mark Watney.</p> <blockquote> <p>Watney discovers a problem. Watney worries for a sentence or two. Watney comes up with a solution. Watney enacts the solution with minimal struggle. Watney celebrates. Rinse and repeat.</p> </blockquote> <p>There, Thomas has described what goes on in 75% of the pages. Sigh! This guy Watney is an unbelievable genius. No trouble or challenge is big for him. He glides over every challenge as one would with a game of toys. Actually that&#x2019;s exactly how Andy Weir, the author, writes this; as if he is Andy from <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toy Story</a> spinning an action-drama around Woody during his play time. Throw anything at him, he would have the smarts, the resources and the luck with him to soar out of it. And you know right that at the beginning of every log Watney writes.</p> <p>There lies the novel&#x2019;s biggest drawback. It just has one tone, <em>the tone of success</em>. And you can&#x2019;t build a thriller if the reader is just not thrilled for the protagonist.</p> <p>To sum up, this is what Thomas has to say.</p> <blockquote> <p>My overall thoughts on The Martian center on its lack of introspection and repetitive descriptions of action, its disconcerting lack of characterization, and the drought of struggle each of the characters underwent. Watney faces a difficult situation, but I at no point in my entire reading thought he would suffer, based on his Pollyanna tone.</p> </blockquote> <p>Completely agree. I do not think Andy Weir wanted to write a thriller about a Martian. He wanted to jot down his thoughts on what will it take scientifically for a guy to survive on Mars. And the novel is a breezy light log of these thoughts. You can skim through it without getting involved, like any science paper/theory you read.</p> <p>All said, this is a nice fleet of thoughts, dreams of Andy Weir. The efforts that Andy Weir <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Weir_(writer)#Writing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has put in</a> that <em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>included extensive research into orbital mechanics, conditions on Mars, the history of manned spaceflight, and botany&#x201D;</em> for the novel shows.

				"content_text": "<h2 id=\"dark-psycho-thriller-with-neither-mystery-nor-thrill.\">Dark, Psycho Thriller with neither Mystery nor Thrill.</h2> <p>I started reading this book wanting, assuming, it to be a suspenseful thriller. I was unaware it is more of a <em>sociopathic, twisted whine-fest</em>. Some can call it a character study, narrative of flawed minds. For me, though, it is all whining. Sick. Sorry!</p> <p>First. You get thrilled only when you long for some character, root for the happenings surrounding their lives. <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21480930.Gone_Girl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gone Girl</a> presented none too me. None of the protagonists, neither Nick nor Amy, interested me. They are too twisted for me to care for them. There was a time I wanted them to just get rid of one another.</p> <p>Second. Plot progresses at unbearable pace. Not slow. <em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>Unbearable&#x201D;</em>. It is either stagnant when author is flaunting her literary chops, narrating<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>character study&#x201D;. Or it progresses to next sub-plot or twist way too conveniently. Nothing is believable here. I could not connect to, sympathise with or even imagine any of the events.

I was pleasantly surprised when the app supported adding the movie ticket to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passbook_(application)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Passbook</a> as an event entry pass.

They do have a machine to collect the tickets though. However <strong>anyone</strong>, with the booking id, can print the ticket without any validation. He, then, can flash it further as a valid entry pass. Plus it&#x2019;s heading read <em><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201D;</span>Booked by Internet&#x201D;</em>.

In such small spaces, we have 3 tiers of <em>convenience</em>, Silver, Gold and Platinum. Like a regular middle class person, I selected the middle-tier. Surprisingly, the distribution is as any corporate evaluates its employees&#x2019; performance. 10% are awesome. 10% suck. All others are regular blokes who are just <em>okiesh</em>. Same was the case here; 1 row of platinum folks and 1 row of silver. <em>In between the 8 rows of fools</em>. Platinum folks sat with their necks held high, <em>not because they paid more</em>. But because they could hardly see what rolled on the screen without doing so. Then I do clearly recall a<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>silver&#x201D; person turning around and laughing at the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">&#x201C;</span>golden&#x201D; dummy sitting behind; pointing at his silliness to have paid more.

Interstellar deserved better. Multiplex are to know that. Sigh.</p></li> <li><p>Every movie is to have an intermission. After all&#xA0;, we believe in giving businesses to many. If there&#x2019;s no intermission, how are the samosa, pop-corn walas to get their earnings? So a movie is abruptly stopped. Usually I feel every Hollywood movie-maker is aware of this fact; so I could find a logical break being put in every movie.

I feel the novel fails there too. Codes and clues are way too simple, straight-forward. Many don't even lead something significant; they are just there to bring Langdon in picture. Inferno could well have been a sci-fi mystery novel instead of a Robert Langdon one. Disappointed.\n\nMy rating: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/644631174\">2 of 5 stars</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/21425016-amit\">View all my reviews</a>\n",

How simple would the life have been if the time was same for everyone, 2am is 2am. Irrespective of whether you are in USA or Germany or Australia or India.

I mean haven&#8217;t you made the concept &#8216;time&#8217; itself enough confusing sucker that now you add another two heavy words before that?<br /><br />Look at what it does in Australia. Daylight savings is put in place so that afternoons are brightest and mornings are lesser. They move the time further by an hour. So 5pm AEST is now 6pm AEST. I still can&#8217;t accept that there was no sensible guy present who crawled at them shouting dudes you are screwing the evenings.<br /><br />Now it does not get dark till 8pm. Yeah bugger 8pm is the time when you can say it is evening. And as a nice middle class Indian kid I am taught to sleep at 10:00pm. So basically I sleep when the evening has just dawned. Screw you Mr. Daylight Saver.<br /><br />Moreover I never understand why the eff was this philosophy put in place at the first place. Not like it is saving hell lot of light or something. Irrespective of this daylight saving, light will remain the same between dawn and dusk. Why add 1 hour rather than simply calling it a day when there is light, not when it is 5am.<br /><br />Now to the outcome of all these twisted minds. Today when some dumbo mentions just some random time, say 2pm, you have to first query is it his time or yours? Lucky you if he is not a dumbo and says yours. But as I have called him a dumbo, he has to say it is his 2pm.<br /><br />So you have to first think what country he is at. Then think what season/month it is at that place. Then think if it is sunny enough there for introducing daylight savings? Then if it is, find out how many hours you need to add to make sure you know when you need to call him exactly. Thank you, you SOAB.<br /><br />Now don&#8217;t be too smart yourself and bring in technologies like google and world clocks and all. Thats not the point.<br /><br />The point is wouldn&#8217;t the world be a little less messy and irritating a place to spend lifetime of yours at, had you not have to worry about as simple a question as &#8220;what time is it&#8221;?<br /><br />PS: I believe there was a reason for bringing all these concepts through.

Big time embarrassment I tell you.</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p>See I am not being cynical here. I am equally happy that this person neared his death by one more year. But the problem is no one sings that song with the feelings it was actually meant to have. Plus the guy for whom the song is being sung is equally embarrassed as those who sing that song. So question arises why sing it at all.</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p>Moreover I always felt whoever sung that song for the first time had something anti-asian boiling in his mind. Why the hell will he compose the third line the way he did then?</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p>Confused? Well you haven&#8217;t sung, on top of your voice, &#8220;Happy b&#8217;day dear Harmoninderpal or Au or Venkataramana&#8221; then. I have and let me tell you, it is very effort taking. Need an indication of how effort taking and difficult it is? Well try and make <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1651315/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"IMDB: Nisha Kothari\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nisha Kothari</a> act.</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p>So the point am trying to make is stop singing this song. The melody was picked up from some song sung by two kindergarten school teachers in some late 1800&#8217;s and it does not suit this age now. Go read details <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday_to_You\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Happy Birthday to You\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. Stop being moronic and make all the people involved, cake cutters and cake eaters, embarrassed. Birthday celebrations would be lesser pathetic this way.</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p>PS: This song singing always reminds of the way we used to hum the &#8220;maine pyar tumhise kiya hain..&#8221; song during antakshari sessions in front of the girls, which were the &#8216;things&#8217; we used to interact with just during such sessions back then. Embarrassing, way embarrassing!</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p>PPS: The key to the &#8220;since 1912&#8221; part in title is in that link I shared for this moronic song&#8217;s history.

So question arises why sing it at all.\n\n<br />\n\nMoreover I always felt whoever sung that song for the first time had something anti-asian boiling in his mind. Why the hell will he compose the third line the way he did then?\n\n<br />\n\nConfused? Well you haven&#8217;t sung, on top of your voice, &#8220;Happy b&#8217;day dear Harmoninderpal or Au or Venkataramana&#8221; then. I have and let me tell you, it is very effort taking. Need an indication of how effort taking and difficult it is? Well try and make <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1651315/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"IMDB: Nisha Kothari\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nisha Kothari</a> act.\n\n<br />\n\nSo the point am trying to make is stop singing this song. The melody was picked up from some song sung by two kindergarten school teachers in some late 1800&#8217;s and it does not suit this age now. Go read details <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday_to_You\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Happy Birthday to You\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. Stop being moronic and make all the people involved, cake cutters and cake eaters, embarrassed. Birthday celebrations would be lesser pathetic this way.\n\n<br />\n\nPS: This song singing always reminds of the way we used to hum the &#8220;maine pyar tumhise kiya hain..&#8221; song during antakshari sessions in front of the girls, which were the &#8216;things&#8217; we used to interact with just during such sessions back then. Embarrassing, way embarrassing!\n\n<br />\n\nPPS: The key to the &#8220;since 1912&#8221; part in title is in that link I shared for this moronic song&#8217;s history. Go grab a bite.\n\n<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/uploads/2020/003972092a.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n",

So finally decided I should repost some old post. Here goes one such post.<br /><br />Yesterday i had quite a random dream. Random indeed it was. For the most part of it i was pretty happy about what i was experiencing. And suddenly i went blank. I would say the dream went blank. Making me befuddled. Completely perplexed. Full of queries, queries for myself to answer. But before i get into the dream itself, let me blabber my views on dreams in general.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://elatedamit.wordpress.com/2008/09/19/switching-lives/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignleft\" style=\"border:10px;\" title=\"Stranger\" src=\"http://elatedamit.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/20070315093644_stranger_fog.jpg?w=199\" alt=\"\" width=\"199\" height=\"300\" /></a>Dreams are angels. Yes, they have the power to make you experience the bests and worsts of your life at the same time. Indeed we experience the dreams, not just see them. How else can you explain your turning, jumping, twisting, crawling, grawling in the sleep. We are experiencing the event, the dream. I myself have woken up thanking god for turning whatever i experienced into a dream. And then there are those times when i just put myself to sleep again, just to experience what remained incomplete, unexperienced.<br /><br />Further, the dreams are mutable portkeys. I feel i change lives in dreams. Butterfly effect you can say. But there one can decide if he wants to change his life. Here i don&#8217;t. It all depends on my other self, the dreaming threaded me. If he wants me there, i go. Otherwise i just lay here, wake up and continue.<br /><br />Details. Two threads, if dreaming together, show how the life each is experiencing. We exchange both the positives and negatives. Yes, if you notice, each dream comprises of both goods and bads. We experience some scenes of that life, both happened and yet to happen. Yucks and Wows. If both agree to switch, we switch.<br /><br />Now you see this concept explains a lot of usualities. Take Deja Vu. Yes indeed it is that &#8216;yet-to-happen&#8217; scene of the life. We experienced it in the dream before we made the shift. Those jerky wake ups. May be the other self just slapped me for spending such sucking life. Or may be i did it to him for his sucking life. Roaming with unknowns. Yes, you don&#8217;t afterall expect two me&#8217;s having the same set of friends. Those long nights can be the result of just a mismatch between timings of two threads. Same goes for the short nights.<br /><br />I will stop. Remove your thinking caps and plunge into the dreamland with the view. You might find quite a few interesting answers.<br /><br />Anyways back to my dream i dreamed yesterday. I dreamed i was a singer, i was singing well. (Ok, i never said the other me has to be &#8220;me&#8221;ish. He can indeed me quite contradictory to who i am right?) Audience were happy. I saw my struggle. I saw my first assignment. I was watching myself happy. I watched all the happy me&#8217;s. Nothing bad. No yucks. And suddenly it was blank. I don&#8217;t remember something like this happening earlier. The dreams changed. The places changed. I woke up suddenly. But it never happened that the dream turned blank, with me facing eternity full of whiteness.<br /><br />Puzzled, I lay there, closed eyed and open minded, waiting for something to happen. But all in vain. Blank. Whiteness everywhere. Finally i woke up and <a href=\"http://elatedamit.wordpress.com/2008/08/25/tottering-along/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tottered my way along</a> &#8230; With mind full of questions.

If both agree to switch, we switch.<br /><br />Now you see this concept explains a lot of usualities. Take Deja Vu. Yes indeed it is that &#8216;yet-to-happen&#8217; scene of the life. We experienced it in the dream before we made the shift. Those jerky wake ups. May be the other self just slapped me for spending such sucking life. Or may be i did it to him for his sucking life. Roaming with unknowns. Yes, you don&#8217;t afterall expect two me&#8217;s having the same set of friends. Those long nights can be the result of just a mismatch between timings of two threads. Same goes for the short nights.<br /><br />I will stop. Remove your thinking caps and plunge into the dreamland with the view. You might find quite a few interesting answers.<br /><br />Anyways back to my dream i dreamed yesterday. I dreamed i was a singer, i was singing well. (Ok, i never said the other me has to be &#8220;me&#8221;ish. He can indeed me quite contradictory to who i am right?) Audience were happy. I saw my struggle. I saw my first assignment. I was watching myself happy. I watched all the happy me&#8217;s. Nothing bad. No yucks. And suddenly it was blank. I don&#8217;t remember something like this happening earlier. The dreams changed. The places changed. I woke up suddenly. But it never happened that the dream turned blank, with me facing eternity full of whiteness.<br /><br />Puzzled, I lay there, closed eyed and open minded, waiting for something to happen. But all in vain. Blank. Whiteness everywhere. Finally i woke up and <a href=\"http://elatedamit.wordpress.com/2008/08/25/tottering-along/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tottered my way along</a> &#8230; With mind full of questions.

I know sometimes i have spent too much time and worried i get thinking the cameras might caught me goofing around at the same position and i might be busted as potential terrorist. But what the hell  .. risk is worth it.\n\nAnd then there are those times when i don’t get choosy thinking i know what i want and i have got what i want. And this is what i buy.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n\nAnd this is what the description read (which i happen to read when i rinsed my mouth with this dude)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">For healthier mouth, remind kids to brush their teeth and use Listerine Smart Rinse twice a day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Listerine Smart Rinse for Kids 6+</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img src=\"uploads/2020/01542b68ab.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /></div>\n",

Yes. You heard it right. Goat arming itself up with a shotgun and making the Vigilante men stare down the gun nozzle? All for a Mazda 323? I mean common. A Mazda 323 can only be as useful to a goat as a padded two&#8217;s to Pamela. If you neglect the lone possibility of she pooping on it. If it has been for &#8220;hay&#8221;, there was at least a chance of this happening.</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">That&#8217;s not it all. Actually there were a couple of them. Dude, coupling Hayek with Pamela still keep padded ones look useless. Moreover a couple of goats stealing a car? I know scientists are trying weird experiments on animals these days like cloning n all. But i never heard of such advanced experiment of churning out a species with body of goat and mind of <a title=\"No Country for Old Men\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477348/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anton Chigurh</a>. Not even on the fastest news reporting channel on this bloody earth, &#8220;<a href=\"http://aajtak.itgo.in/index.php?issueid=&amp;id=&amp;option=com_registration&amp;task=videopage&amp;assignedvideoid=4989&amp;sectionid=16&amp;secid=0&amp;start_bottom=16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aajtak</a>&#8221;. So if its not reported on Aajtak yet, its not possible even for 10 years now.</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Although the main part is what might suit the tastes of few channels here. You see actually they were two guys who were trying to rob the car when the Vigilantes confronted them. One ran and other turned himself into the goat. Now the dangerous little goat is in custody and the police are waiting to prove it scientifically that it actually is possible to convert a person into a goat magically(!). Now i get it. So it was not the goat who was robbing armed, it was actually a man.</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">But now that it is crystal clear, i do not have even a single word to speak? First thing they actually do not shoot the white n black beast wearing so dangerous a throne of horn right at sighting it. Secondly they ask to prove that it is possible that an armed man can be converted into a goat? Common. The scientist have long discovered the dose to convert the buffalo-like-hardly-rising small dumb little ball of flesh into an ultra-active-hard-hitting beast. They call it an energy drink which does transform a sleepy crawling man into an awesome enthusiast you see. So calming down the beast to a goat look alike is just too easy a job. Just a bit of physical transformation is required that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So here i urge the related police staff to take a strict action against the goat and hang her till her death. The man that actually has transformed himself into goat is too dangerous for this world and so are his accessary. I heard they are working on something which can make this happen&#8230;</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-273 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.elatedamit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/kitty_gun-300x266.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"266\" /></p>\n\n<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/uploads/2020/31478f9177.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n",

Not even on the fastest news reporting channel on this bloody earth, &#8220;<a href=\"http://aajtak.itgo.in/index.php?issueid=&amp;id=&amp;option=com_registration&amp;task=videopage&amp;assignedvideoid=4989&amp;sectionid=16&amp;secid=0&amp;start_bottom=16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aajtak</a>&#8221;. So if its not reported on Aajtak yet, its not possible even for 10 years now.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Although the main part is what might suit the tastes of few channels here. You see actually they were two guys who were trying to rob the car when the Vigilantes confronted them. One ran and other turned himself into the goat. Now the dangerous little goat is in custody and the police are waiting to prove it scientifically that it actually is possible to convert a person into a goat magically(!). Now i get it. So it was not the goat who was robbing armed, it was actually a man.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">But now that it is crystal clear, i do not have even a single word to speak? First thing they actually do not shoot the white n black beast wearing so dangerous a throne of horn right at sighting it. Secondly they ask to prove that it is possible that an armed man can be converted into a goat? Common. The scientist have long discovered the dose to convert the buffalo-like-hardly-rising small dumb little ball of flesh into an ultra-active-hard-hitting beast. They call it an energy drink which does transform a sleepy crawling man into an awesome enthusiast you see. So calming down the beast to a goat look alike is just too easy a job. Just a bit of physical transformation is required that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So here i urge the related police staff to take a strict action against the goat and hang her till her death. The man that actually has transformed himself into goat is too dangerous for this world and so are his accessary. I heard they are working on something which can make this happen&#8230;</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-273 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.elatedamit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/kitty_gun-300x266.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"266\" /></p>\n\n<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/uploads/2020/31478f9177.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n",

				"content_html": "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I have been gliding in the darkness for around 3 hours now, for one simple reason. The tube light in my room suddenly felt a strong desire not to glow. It went on blinking at me, i guess trying to figure out if i have worn any .. pajamas or not. I did try and rotate it around, with it never returning me a stare. While spending my precious time there, stroking the keyboard in darkness, a question just poked its head out of the ruffled mind. Why the heck is the darkness there.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-166 alignleft\" title=\"bulb1\" src=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/uploads/2020/e929579408.jpg\" alt=\"bulb1\" width=\"130\" height=\"92\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I mean, ok fine. I know why it is there. I do have scribbled through the endless questions on solar system and planets structure and their hecking orbits. But i am not concerned about its how it exists. Rather i want to know how useful is it. I just want to justify its existence with one hell of a random reason, the farther it is from the truth, better it is.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I feel everything that exists, does so for some random reason. Even the minutest thing like a microbe is there because it leads or conjoins together to form or shape something awesomely important like virus, lets say. Yes they are weighty in a sense to control the growth of the big parasites in the form of humans. Similarly something like air, whose presence cannot be seen, is there to blow the smelly farts away. The sole reason for such senselessly senseless arguments is to emphasize the point that, yes, each thing can be tagged with the reason for its existence.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">But even the random mind of mine could not reasonify the existence of darkness. To develop films?? Nah, very few do that now and those who do it actually do it by pulling over darkness. We are focusing on the natural darkness that arises with night.  To sleep??? Nah, actually sleep has got more to do with the time than it has got to do with darkness.  What then?</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I know i am acting a bit ignorant, by may be neglecting many scientific things. I actually want to because i want some reason out of my mutable mind. The only reason i can think of gives me goosebumps.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I feel the whole purpose of darkness is to hide the light. So darkness is not \"non-existence of light\". But actually it is the other way round. Light is \"non-existence of darkness\". Whenever there is something that nature wants to do without making humans aware, it pushes darkness in. So it must be doing something at each night. Intercourse? Quite possible.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">An argument can be made saying people do put on the lights then. But actually you see, that's the reason they just blink sometimes rather than staring. And thats the reason am in dark today. Nature is at work. Reproducing :)</p>\n",

A previous <a title=\"What Happened to my Ambitions\" href=\"http://snoozyrealm.wordpress.com/2008/09/26/what-happened-to-my-ambitions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post</a> has had many hits from the Google search. I know there is nothing surprising about this part. But what follows is.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The query type was usually like \"My ambition in life\" or \"My ambition\" or \"What are my ambitions\" or \"My plans and ambitions\". One query was also of the sort saying \"Why have i lost my ambition\". Instant reaction was like, ok, i know Google does answer your query. But i dearly wish it does not move to this personal level. I dearly wish a day would never come when i would google for \"Where have i forgotten my underwear\". I dearly wish i don't.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">But after some time, I thought fare enough. Someone must have searched for an essay with this topic. Afterall even i remember how, during the 2nd -5th standard, my ambition changed with changing teachers and essay books. It mutated from a nation serving politician or soldier to a hard-working-son-of-soil farmer to a life saving doctor. Frankly speaking, considering the level of english i could blabber on my own, the essay that was not lengthy enough not to be mugged up, at the same time sounded good and earned marks had content for \"My ambition\". But i don't remember myself ever scribbling about being a \"gibberish-speaking\" sleepy bug dwelling in virtual reality, being a computer engineering, i.e., to be specific.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Anyways this fact urged me to think what really is an ambition. I thought of mining the precise definition for the word and to my surprise what it really means is \"an ardent desire to achieve something\". An ardent desire? That is it? Boss, i have been ceaselessly told my ambition has to foretell a long time down the future. All those \"cheek-bursting\" aunts and grandmas and uncles danced on my head for ages to know what i would be when i grow old, what is my ambition. I always doubted if they wanted to boggle the million rupees estate i would have. To such extent was my fear that i started publishing \"social service\" as my ambition just to push the demons away.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">But now i feel pity that i was wandering along without really answering that question in the best way. If an ardent desire is what ambition is all about, then yes i would have had hundreds of ambitions. And the list has grown to a thousands now with passing age. With each ambition i achieved, i feel i have installed few more in the list. I know and still remember the whole gyan about a life lived without ambition is like an arrow fired without an aim. But then if i have to talk practically I feel it is highly impossible to lay the path for whole life right at the birth. Nah one can't.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">And that does not mean as a child i spent my life without an aim. I still had an aim to complete my homework just to rush out to play hide n seek or help mom out with an aim to go out for a walk in some mela or finish every possible household exercises even on a foggy Sunday with an aim just to use that as an excuse while am watching a cricket match. Now i know these were my ambitions. Far more practical than being a politician or a doctor.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Yes i know there are still these whole lot of concepts of long term goal and short term goals and art of living and blah. So I feel skeptic to use ambition as a word. I feel i better call it a simple desire.  I have decided to pursue my billions of small but practical desires under the hood of long term, impractical or rather unverifiable ambition of being a respected and followed both professionally and personally. I have <a title=\"What happened to my ambition?\" href=\"http://snoozyrealm.wordpress.com/2008/09/26/what-happened-to-my-ambitions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">already mentioned</a> how my ambitions faded away with time. I know my desires won't. I would be happy if the list grows to some tens of thousands, that would imply that i atleast completed 100 such desires. 100 such ambitionsi will call them.</p>\n",

Its pretty amazing how the author's, the director's view can change a dragging chitchatting of a \"just-met\" couple into such awesome a journey for the viewer too. I mean, even i kind of get surprised that i thoroughly enjoyed a normal passage of some hours of two-people's life, their passage from strangers to lovers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-155\" title=\"before_sunrise_film\" src=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/uploads/2020/4f257ae125.jpg\" alt=\"before_sunrise_film\" width=\"207\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Everything about this movie left me impressed. The sweet time it takes to unfold itself, the locales of Vienna crawling beautifully behind the leads, the gentle music in the background. All these small little things just heaved my experience of what lied at the core, the subtle talks of the couple in lead. I relished everything the author was trying to say. It made me think, made me revisit my thoughts about many things. I mean not just about love, about life too. All it had to say about death, god etc. Small little gems like the one when the actress, Celine, talks about the old man who spent his whole life thinking about his career and his work. That was just a spectacularly well written scene.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">And about love, well its better experienced in the movie itself. I am speechless, out of word to spell out my experience. Its not just for the one's in love, but also for the others to relish.  All those  pretty words, the moist  eyed stares, those mushy silences, the tender touches. Everything. The poem in particular written with so plain a word, milkshake, as its base. Man, spectacular is the word.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Yes, I want to wend one such passage before sunrise in my life, if possible in Vienna. And yes, if so beautiful is love crafted on the moving canvas, am sure i won't be alone feeling that way.</p>\n",

Yes, they have the power to make you experience the bests and worsts of your life at the same time. Indeed we experience the dreams, not just see them. How else can you explain your turning, jumping, twisting, crawling, grawling in the sleep. We are experiencing the event, the dream. I myself have woken up thanking god for turning whatever i experienced into a dream. And then there are those times when i just put myself to sleep again, just to experience what remained incomplete, unexperienced.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Further, the dreams are mutable portkeys. I feel i change lives in dreams. Butterfly effect you can say. But there one can decide if he wants to change his life. Here i don't. It all depends on my other self, the dreaming threaded me. If he wants me there, i go. Otherwise i just lay here, wake up and continue.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Details. Two threads, if dreaming together, show how the life each is experiencing. We exchange both the positives and negatives. Yes, if you notice, each dream comprises of both goods and bads. We experience some scenes of that life, both happened and yet to happen. Yucks and Wows. If both agree to switch, we switch.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now you see this concept explains a lot of usualities. Take Deja Vu. Yes indeed it is that 'yet-to-happen' scene of the life. We experienced it in the dream before we made the shift. Those jerky wake ups. May be the other self just slapped me for spending such sucking life. Or may be i did it to him for his sucking life. Roaming with unknowns. Yes, you don't afterall expect two me's having the same set of friends. Those long nights can be the result of just a mismatch between timings of two threads. Same goes for the short nights.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I will stop. Remove your thinking caps and plunge into the dreamland with the view. You might find quite a few interesting answers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Anyways back to my dream i dreamed yesterday. I dreamed i was a singer, i was singing well. (Ok, i never said the other me has to be \"me\"ish. He can indeed me quite contradictory to who i am right?) Audience were happy. I saw my struggle. I saw my first assignment.

The places changed. I woke up suddenly.

POF you see ...</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I am pretty sure most of the so-called experienced internet surfers would have reached at this point far late than they would normally have. Because i have become one of those and i damn know that he would atleast have done few of following:</p>\n\n<ol style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n    <li>Google for some random text (<em>Default</em>)</li>\n    <li>Peeped into GTalk friends list</li>\n    <li>Checked whether have received any new mail</li>\n    <li>Checked if all social friends are up and running</li>\n    <li>Followed into void via atleast 3 Links</li>\n    <li>If yes for 3, Gave a thought and made a point for each one of them</li>\n    <li>Oh ya .. paid some bill</li>\n    <li>Rejected atleast a single credit card offer</li>\n    <li>And oh ya .. worked :P</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I guess the list would build on n on. Anyways the point is surely you wouldn't have, if you have become one of us, read till now at a single strech. (I would really like to know what you indeed did. Put in the comments section. Hold on... Read completely first)</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Ok i won't try and find the reasons for why this is happening because that is not going to help me understand any damn thing. Let that job be left for some XYZ research group of companies. What i would actually try is provide some ways i can become a normal being from a 'skull-headed vaccum with rags of information' which am now. Let me start listing them down.</p>\n\n<ul style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n    <li><strong>Update Google searh bar:</strong> I feel google can hugely impact a large sector of us concentration loosers. If only they ask for some not-so-privacy-threatning but self-embarrassing queries before returing the result. Lets say, \"For how much hours have you worked today\".</li>\n    <li><strong>Redesign Operating Systems</strong>: Huge step i know. The one i would design is, i would say, mainly a build over on MS Vista. Ok , so you want switch program? Start. \"<em>Do you really want to open ...? Yes/No</em>\", \"<em>Enter your Password ******</em>\", \"<em>Please re-enter the password ******</em>\", \"<em>Thank You! Please select the program you want to open. Enter the number in from of the selection</em>\", \"<em>Enter the text in captcha</em>\", \"<em>Thank you! Click Finish to open the program</em>\" and finally \"Y<em>our request to open ____ has been successfully served. OK/Back</em>\" I am damn sure this will majorly kill the frequent ALT+TAB s</li>\n    <li><strong>Introduce Sticky Books</strong>: Ok what if i want am not the comp junkie and still cherish the hardcopies? How can i be glued to the plot in the book? Fine. We will manually and physically do that for you. The books will be fitted with microprocessors programmed for secreting glues for defined time period which would be not less than 1 hour. You see. Its that simple.</li>\n    <li><strong>Rename weekdays</strong>: Ok so point is inject a standard work schedule through out the human fraternity. Lets make each focus on a particular kind of job on the specified day. I would suggest let the week names be <em>Funday</em> (random fun), <em>Moneyday</em>(Money Matters), <em>Teamday</em>(Social Team Building), <em>Workday</em> (I know .. Boring Day), <em>Surfday</em>(Random Internet Surfing), <em>Reworkday</em>(Yeah .. 2 of them. Afterall thats what one is paid for) and <em>Saturday</em> (!!!!)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I know these options do sound rather ludicrous and more apparent changes like stop building multiprocessing processors or build 'one system one application' OSes might sound sensible. But then it is a \"Build dam for water leaks\" kinda solution. Anyways that's my foolish take on this not-so-foolish topic. Comment in your solutions, however foolish they may sound. Remember, there are many like you around you...</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Finally must say I have always been a workaholic enthusiast ... What remains now is just an -aholic enthusiast surfing endlessly in void.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>PS:</strong> If you have read this post in a single strech, i am damn sure you have just crumbled into wrong space. Click the back arrow button at the top-left corner of this window.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Update:</strong> Another interesting take on the same line. <a title=\"I am stupid and the internet made me so\" href=\"http://www.sastwingees.org/2008/06/22/i-am-stupid-and-the-internet-made-me-so/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I am stupid and the Internet made me so</a></p>\n",

Hold on... Read completely first)</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Ok i won't try and find the reasons for why this is happening because that is not going to help me understand any damn thing. Let that job be left for some XYZ research group of companies. What i would actually try is provide some ways i can become a normal being from a 'skull-headed vaccum with rags of information' which am now. Let me start listing them down.</p>\n\n<ul style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n    <li><strong>Update Google searh bar:</strong> I feel google can hugely impact a large sector of us concentration loosers. If only they ask for some not-so-privacy-threatning but self-embarrassing queries before returing the result. Lets say, \"For how much hours have you worked today\".</li>\n    <li><strong>Redesign Operating Systems</strong>: Huge step i know. The one i would design is, i would say, mainly a build over on MS Vista. Ok , so you want switch program? Start. \"<em>Do you really want to open ...? Yes/No</em>\", \"<em>Enter your Password ******</em>\", \"<em>Please re-enter the password ******</em>\", \"<em>Thank You! Please select the program you want to open. Enter the number in from of the selection</em>\", \"<em>Enter the text in captcha</em>\", \"<em>Thank you! Click Finish to open the program</em>\" and finally \"Y<em>our request to open ____ has been successfully served. OK/Back</em>\" I am damn sure this will majorly kill the frequent ALT+TAB s</li>\n    <li><strong>Introduce Sticky Books</strong>: Ok what if i want am not the comp junkie and still cherish the hardcopies? How can i be glued to the plot in the book? Fine. We will manually and physically do that for you. The books will be fitted with microprocessors programmed for secreting glues for defined time period which would be not less than 1 hour. You see. Its that simple.</li>\n    <li><strong>Rename weekdays</strong>: Ok so point is inject a standard work schedule through out the human fraternity. Lets make each focus on a particular kind of job on the specified day. I would suggest let the week names be <em>Funday</em> (random fun), <em>Moneyday</em>(Money Matters), <em>Teamday</em>(Social Team Building), <em>Workday</em> (I know .. Boring Day), <em>Surfday</em>(Random Internet Surfing), <em>Reworkday</em>(Yeah .. 2 of them. Afterall thats what one is paid for) and <em>Saturday</em> (!!!!)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I know these options do sound rather ludicrous and more apparent changes like stop building multiprocessing processors or build 'one system one application' OSes might sound sensible. But then it is a \"Build dam for water leaks\" kinda solution. Anyways that's my foolish take on this not-so-foolish topic. Comment in your solutions, however foolish they may sound. Remember, there are many like you around you...</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Finally must say I have always been a workaholic enthusiast ... What remains now is just an -aholic enthusiast surfing endlessly in void.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>PS:</strong> If you have read this post in a single strech, i am damn sure you have just crumbled into wrong space. Click the back arrow button at the top-left corner of this window.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Update:</strong> Another interesting take on the same line. <a title=\"I am stupid and the internet made me so\" href=\"http://www.sastwingees.org/2008/06/22/i-am-stupid-and-the-internet-made-me-so/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I am stupid and the Internet made me so</a></p>\n",

But all thanks to my random weirdness, i flew far away from the thought lane and settled spending my complete time over choosing a blog template. Surprisingly, the decision to change the template was not a result of spontaneous wave of randomness. Rather it was with a thought that a simple and neat theme may load faster. (Not that i wanted not to loose the readers. What i wanted was not to make my readers loose there precious time pondering over what will load in.)<br /><br />So all the ideas still remain spread over notepad.

Some call them weird, some call them funny, some call them odd or even feverish at times, but for me, they make least sense with any tag you tie them with. But, however brainless it may sound, i am always on hunt for such stories at various loci (and as a result of that, i have this collection of all such <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/pipes/weird_funny\">hotspots</a>). Blame it to my idiotic hobby of running random or to my faithful affection for going mad, i do look out for a chance, chance to turn mad.</div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Here's one such recent story. It seems that researchers have found out some weird <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080410/ap_on_fe_st/indonesia_lungless_frog\">frog with no lungs</a>. No, I have no problem with them churning out so wondrous a finding. What my juvenile mind never understood was how these men of brain flooded with boundless wit carry out such humongous tasks. What was it that they have in them that any normal person didn't? And then this story rose, like a sage would from foggy nothingness, to content my ignorance.\n\nBut before moving straight to the answer, let me take you through the line of thoughts my mutable mind followed along. A plain look at the title and it made me think 'Damn!! How on earth did they find that? Were they running around, scissors in hand, chopping each and every frog they cross, looking for their bloody bellies (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">pun intended</span>) for any abnormalities in them? And what did they think of as an answer they would provided to all those normal, but with a robbed sac like belly, frogs? Would a \"Hey sorry mate! We are searching for your deviant buddy. By the way, do contact a doc soon.\" do? Nah it won't. How can they be so irresponsible towards the nature. They indeed are answerable to the frog fraternity.' Now i don't think this path is too abnormal. Any sensible one would have thought on the same lines. I felt mighty of myself for being so empathetic and felt<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> that this needed to be blogged</span>. But that feeling wasn't there to last for long.\n\nAs i strolled through the story, the reality came into picture. The answer for \"what was it that they have\" earlier arose. It takes loads of  patience, time and prolonged interest for hitting something so uninteresting and so \"evolutionarily unique\", as they call it, head-on. How else can you explain the fact that when the friends of this enlightened scientists were busy lurking  behind the materialistic pleasures, his majesty was busy searching for this mighty frog community, one of whose member he saw when he was 30 years younger. It required a mind full of unsatisfiable quests and determination not to find solution. How else would you explain the fact that once he did find one of them, he continued his quest to find 8 of their kinds and tore their lungless tummies apart before going \"EUREKA\". I thought this answer that i mined was 'pen'able and again felt<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> that this needed to be blogged</span>.\n\nI wish this was enough. But they went on to explain how their closest relatives had lungs and what that really means. Finally they didn't even forget to connect this with manly attempts to ruin the mother earth and a need to stop doing the same. Also a call at the end to protect earth from  facing this \"huge impact\".\n\nNow all this was enough to make me feel <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">that this needed to be blogged</span>.

Its this rosy day, that if you enjoy, you have to lose your liberty (control myself?? forget... ), equality (how dare one asks to be equal with the almighty partner), justice (when i know i have to agree that the person in front has to be right, whats the point asking for justice), freedom (what freedom can a criminal expect when he sentenced life imprisonment for himself). You do this and you sure will earn security, security for commitment. Just make sure you do burn your entirety.\n",

(P.S. I did succeed in beating one dreaded task. Successfully washed the clothes, a task no less than a feat. Though the fear of uncompleteness did keep me away from taking a bath and shaving. You see victory ask for persistent efforts :P) And along my stroll, I  again dashed into a place i find the most meaningless. The Communities.<br /><br />I always thought that it should be wrong to say that i completely hate them. The fact that i myself have joined around 50 communities should signify that. But then it was today i thought to drill into my communities' choice. And then rose the truth. All the communities i have joined can largely be divided into following categories:<br /></div>\n\n<ul style=\"text-align:justify;\"><li>Ones i joined as a newbie, similar to a kiddie thrown into a toy shop picking random toys</li><li>Ones which i was forced to join with an ultimatum of sort \"Join now\" ('or you will be hanged alive' was always silent :P)</li><li>Ones wherein you just feel great to be part of. It hardly matters how much sense it makes in you joining them</li></ul>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">And it was then i realized that communities are indeed quite a boring and meaningless places to be in. More meaningless than boring. Include one more of <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">ones which i created</span> and I guess we have the categories generic enough to include the whole 'orkut'ers. First, it hardly has any sensible activity going on. (One can surely not mark people proving themselves to be superior by posting last or naming there predecessor or playing jokers as sensible.) Secondly, thanks to the first point and the second and third category, it hardly reflects what the person's interest really are. So a weirdo playing a \"Rate the person above you\" game in C++ community places him straight into the third category just in for senseless fun.<br /><br />Moreover mostly are the occasions wherein the common interest projected itself is quite confusing. There are majority just to display one's liking for <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">blah blah</span> singer, writer, director, actor, books, sports-persons, nations, places and every such namable entity. For each one mentioned above there is an anti-community of haters. Each one of these have various levels of followers: country wise, state wise, city wise, university wise and the digging just goes on. Then there are those which say they exists for common purpose like \"spreading happiness\", \"cutting sorrows\", \"making healthy\", \"shit happens: you are not alone\" and bhah blah. And finally those which are quite weird which do make you raise your eyebrows. Few to mention \"I hate orkut\" (wouldn't it be a good idea to group such interesting people in Facebook) or \"Announce new orkut communities\" (Community with a goal to promote other community?? how innovative) or \"Absurd Communities\" or \"I hate orkut communities\" (need i say anything??). How i wished to be innovative enough to come up with something so fascinating and new. No wonder each community has atleast a single copy with equal number of members.<br /><br />Anyways whatever i say, they do exists and exists with thunderous activities.

If i was made dada, manu etc at home, each one followed that up by gawande, amit, amith (southernized), wasudeo (!!! thats my father's name. Isn't that ironic that it was called when i wanted it to be the least, while distributing the  checked answer sheets), strato, gaws and recently to few more.  I felt like a bot in quake3 arena getting named for each player. Yeah!! as if this wasn't enuf i myself tagged myself with \"the great\", \"the warrior\", \"gaws\", \"gamer\" and simply \"the player\" in gaming arena. But there was the one that kept following me and i dreaded the most. \"Phattu\" (meaning \"the fearful\". Quite interesting isn't it? I feared the name itself). Though i felt it wasn't fare enough, I feared the things every normal one did. And if someone didn't i always felt he should be called the fearfree (physo??? :P).<br /><br />Anyways today it was just by chance that i thought why not untie this tag from myself. But the first step was to list down the things i feel i fear the most in recent time. Because the countless times i was afraid is the past now and past hardly counts. So here goes the list of my recent 'fearmakers':<br /><br />1) <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Weekends:</span> Yep. These dudes come with a promise to let me complete all my jobs i have been postponing to meet just to slide under my feet with a lighting speed keeping me awake every sunday night. And thats the night i go to sleep with mostly zilch completed. Few uncompleted jobs include random internet surfs, itemized jobs like meeting, following up with XYZ, completing uncompleted work over the weekdays, do some shopping, paying bills, calling someone and and... Uff the list really goes on. Few which always top the list and remain unbeaten include washing clothes and shaving. Its all because i keep fearing each one of them, i hardly take a bath on sunday. You see i hardly find any time. Facing the monday morning with every planned thing untouched shivers me up.<br />2) <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">News reports boasting someone:</span> It may seem its fully <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">faltu</span> to fear something so stupid. But boss you should watch news channels catching random roaming people and making them comment on <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">blah blah</span> attaining <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">blah</span> feat. And then follow the unending murmurs: \"East or West blah blah is best\", \"Blah blah is great\", \"we love u blah blah\", \"i feel in todays world .... hjhsdjsa.... sjdhsaj\" (a sudden break from news reporter finally breaks his non-abating tempo). I fear heavily that one day it would be me who would end up on either side of the conversation: i mean either boasting someone or holding mic (Nah me getting boasted over a news channel seems hardly probable. Though the speed with which news channels are turning insane, the possibility cannot be negated. And believe me, that would be no less fearful)<br />3) <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Reality shows and SMS:</span> I don't know if the show producers really know that but sending an SMS here at our place does get charged. But lemme be clear. No horror serial/movie isn't as horrifying as these shows. I really worry if i keep on watching the reality shows, time's not far when i would unknowingly type \"&amp;*&amp;* A\" or <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\"LEAD #\" and send that to 56789. Lines are open from saturday 10</span>.... Arggghhh You see the side-effect. It just sticks and stinks inside. And even unknowingly you start blabbering the rules. Now thats the fear.<br />4) <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Google Homepage: </span>Seemingly harmless bot, this is the most dreadful thing among the lot. I myself feel am addicted to this dude now. After atleast every 1 hour of joblessness, I feel to face this faceless creature. I fear he would one day take over my mind one day and and spread his crawler bots to digg out the information hidden inside. The phrase (and widely used \"About me\" statement in social profiles) \"My mind is an open book\" would literally turn into \"My mind is an open searchable entity. Just google it dude\". Its really scary.<br /><br />I guess i should stop for now. Its the Sunday night, have just seen an episode of reality show, been targeted by the boasting news reports recently and just now ebbed myself my visiting google.com. So before I really get bogged down by fear, let me reveal the plan. Plan is i am going to not fear any of these things. Simple solutions is not watch television, no web surfing (surfing without googling??? Just can't imagine) and yep no work postponement. I know that's pretty 'new year resolutions'ish type of statements, but a start need to be made. Once i regain my control over these things, i will move to few other fearmakers. <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Till then good night. Its me signing off for tonight</span>.<span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> Will meet next Sunday same time</span> .. Argghhhh need to sleep. Fearmakers on their way!!!<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Update:</span>As if the \"Google\" fear i talked about earlier wasn't enough, there struck this video which intensified this fearmakers effect on my \"blogged\" mind.

May be a bit Patriotic feeling, which pops up every now and then). </span>\n\nA famous dialog from the movie \"<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072783/\">Chupke Chupke</a>\" starring Dharmendra and Amitabh. \"<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Gende Ka Ful Ful Ho kar bhi ful kyun nahi hain?</span>\" starts guffawing into the ear.\n\nBy the way here goes the main story:\n<blockquote cite=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/16/2033951.htm\">\"A riddle: When is a kilogram that is no longer a kilogram still a kilogram?\n\nAnswer: When the chunk of metal that serves as the official international standard for the kilogram, under triple lock-and-key in France since 1889, inexplicably sheds a little weight.Very little, though. The cylinder of platinum and iridium, sitting under three concentric glass bells like a metallic round of goat's cheese, is 50 micrograms lighter than the average of several dozen copies.\"</blockquote>\n<cite><a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/16/2033951.htm\">Weighty mystery: kilo standard sheds 50 micrograms - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)</a></cite>\n\n</div>\n",

And its this <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">dung</span> that corroded the bridge and made it weaker killing tens. Chances are that this dung will kill many others at different locations.

				"content_text": "<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">There has always been this indelible discussion to find out what makes all these successful corporates and biggies attain the status they hold.

I saw a time stamp next to the link which I opened. The screenshot below displays what i mean by that. I remember reading something along the same lines. But as i tried searching for a reference for the behavior, the efforts didn't throw success.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://bp3.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/Ro5PTSSuwNI/AAAAAAAAAog/KLQp1wKmb6g/s1600-h/gen.jpg\"><img style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http://bp3.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/Ro5PTSSuwNI/AAAAAAAAAog/KLQp1wKmb6g/s320/gen.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>However, the story doesn't end at this stage.  When I tried to playback the same in Internet Explorer, I was stunned to see no such behavior. So thinking that this has to do something with Firefox, I tried scanning other search engines for the display of time stamp, nothing really happen. So bulged a question. Is this behavior related with Google searches in Firefox? If so, whats so different in Firefox than IE? Moreover I am using the latest updated versions of both. I even tested it on a fresh version of Firefox. So i assumed it has least to do with mozilla extensions.<br /><br />As if these questions weren't enough, something more happened that assisted the assumptions. As i deleted the cookies, I wasn't that <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">hoo-haa </span>seeing no stamp. But what baffled me was I was unable to redraw the same behavior.<br /><br />So another question popped up in my mind. Does Google have some playing hours on internet, when they just put in some behavior into there search and pop it out as soon as they test it? Mozilla couldn't do that because thats something that resides on my system. And if it does put something without my consent, I see some good time ahead of me. Anyways currently I have employed myself to demystify this abruptness.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Update: </span>One thought each one gets first is about add-ons in mozilla. But as i mentioned, I tested it out with a fresh version of firefox without any extensions too. So addons have zilch part to play. Moreover the abrupt display and hiding of the time stamp continues now too.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Update2:</span> After a lot of trial and errors and with the help of a very useful comment by <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">whoblah</span>, i was able to understand the behavior. Rather i shouldn't call it a mystery as it really wasn't. It was just an ignorance on my part. Thought let me reveal the solution because there is possibility that there would be many others ignorant enough. In nutshell, the issue has to do with Google's web history, where in for the above behavior to work, one needs to be logged into his Google account. If you are, you can see the complete history about when and how many times have you opened a particular link from Google search. So don't panic if you ever see a time stamp next to the search. Thats Google history at work!!!<br /></div></div></div>\n",

'am fine' \"</span><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">thankxx</span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> - \"am done with my work .... don't expect any more messages after this\"</span><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">uhhhh</span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> - \"go to hell\"</span><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">hhahha</span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> - \"buddy i have to run ... ok ok .. that was good ... stop it for haven's sake now\"</span><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">hmmmm</span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> - \"my mind's empty now boss ... have nothing sensible to say.. \"</span><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">ok ok bye</span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> - \"thats the last statement from me dude. nothing here after; even if u keep shouting your stomach out\"</span><br /><span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">abe sun</span></span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> </span><span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">%$%^*</span></span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> - usual entry statement by a member of <a href=\"http://randombots.googlepages.com/\">RandomBots</a></span><br /><br /><span>These are just a few messages which i was somehow able to demystify. May be not always do they convey the same meaning as stated. But then it goes for any decoded stuff boss. It's meaning is not always what it is decoded as. However, there are many others which are enthusiastically popping to get naked. But they just keep fluctuating there meanings even more often than <a href=\"http://elatedamit.blogspot.com/search/label/Bat%20n%20Ball\">Sachin Tendulkar</a>'s form. I am working part-time to decrypt those. Truly speaking, without really getting paid. Or am I? ;)</span><br /></div>\n",

In the front, a dark green gutter with water bubbling and scenting its way forward, welcomes him. Behind he sees a rock solid demented garbage. Numerous occasions has BMC tried to move it, but thanks to its insane determination, the garbage continues to zero all the BMC's efforts. Either sides provide a deserted plot, green as they are, all credit to the numerous organisms decomposing 'em off. So thanks to the hospital management's endeavors, patients have something to <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">green </span>about. Finally, thats what he requires the most.<br /><br />2) A shop-keeper on Hosur road has his shop named *7%^&amp; (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">this is something in Kannada, so couldn't understand that. A humble call, not to be misinterpreted with its usual meaning :D</span>) <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Tnasportions</span>. I feel, he just wanted to make it clear what his shop was about. Because he felt not everyone can make sense of something in Kannada. But English, boss its a universal language. I am still waiting to see it unclosed one day. Curious as i am about his work.<br /><br />3) Auto and truck drivers are really eager to know how a person following him looks; does he deserve following him or not. So a simple solution they found was to write \"Stop\" at their bum. Now, dignified persons as they are, they face a problem. After all, who likes others staring at their posterior. So what they do is just add an \"OK\" tag to tell, \"Enough gazing my rear boss.\"<br /><br />Enough answering unquestioned questions. There are few more answers waiting to burst out of my mind. But as of now, I am busy slanting my mind to digest these first.<br /></div>\n",

Numerous occasions has BMC tried to move it, but thanks to its insane determination, the garbage continues to zero all the BMC's efforts. Either sides provide a deserted plot, green as they are, all credit to the numerous organisms decomposing 'em off. So thanks to the hospital management's endeavors, patients have something to <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">green </span>about. Finally, thats what he requires the most.<br /><br />2) A shop-keeper on Hosur road has his shop named *7%^&amp; (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">this is something in Kannada, so couldn't understand that. A humble call, not to be misinterpreted with its usual meaning :D</span>) <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Tnasportions</span>. I feel, he just wanted to make it clear what his shop was about. Because he felt not everyone can make sense of something in Kannada. But English, boss its a universal language. I am still waiting to see it unclosed one day. Curious as i am about his work.<br /><br />3) Auto and truck drivers are really eager to know how a person following him looks; does he deserve following him or not. So a simple solution they found was to write \"Stop\" at their bum. Now, dignified persons as they are, they face a problem. After all, who likes others staring at their posterior. So what they do is just add an \"OK\" tag to tell, \"Enough gazing my rear boss.\"<br /><br />Enough answering unquestioned questions. There are few more answers waiting to burst out of my mind. But as of now, I am busy slanting my mind to digest these first.<br /></div>\n",

On numerous occasions have i seen the politicians using the law at their own will. Heating and bashing the law suits, molding them and coining as much money as possible.

Quota dispute and the cauvery row have been the most vexed issues for some time. Cauvery issue though not that significant nation-wide, but i did find the verdict as really interesting. Honest disclosure, am not here to pass my judgment  over the issues. But really could not hold myself from lauding the SC's respective benches.<br /><br />Quota dispute has been one of the hottest topic of discussions over the last one year. The year saw huge rallies, protests and discussions among \"so-called\" leaders presenting (or rather forcing) their views. Nebulous were the intentions of the political parties; the restlessness of thousands of the youths following them, with a hope to get some respite. What was rather clear was that the decision cannot and should not be taken with 75 year old data as yardstick.

OBC quota gets a stay order, with aspiring students getting a bit of relief. Observation of the bench was \"</span></span><span><span class=\"f12\">Reservation cannot be permanent and appear to perpetuate backwardness\". </span></span><span><span class=\"f12\">Harsh </span></span><span><span class=\"f12\">though</span></span><span><span class=\"f12\">, but true to the core. </span></span><span><span class=\"f12\">What I further fancied was the SC's verdict for center's plea to vacate the stay order.

SC passed a verdict asking CM's of the two states to show some \"Statesmanship\". A simple reason was stated that \"any order passed is bound to trigger protests in the aggrieved </span></span><span><span class=\"f12\">states\". </span></span><span><span class=\"f12\">Not only have the bench members refrained from deciding the fortune of the debated dispute but also provided an option to confront the nation wide water-scarcity issue.

But what i fear is that the problem is still far away from being solved. Center's not ready to give up the quota issue so easily, eying the elections. IIMs are still not clear on how to carry the admission process forward. Students stand midway, confused, staring at their hazy future.

Completely oblivious of what's in store next, I hired an auto with just 100's and 500's with me. Finally was caught up in a \"not-so-dissimilar\" situation. Started the usual cry. \"Sir, change do. Itne sabere hum kahan se layenge change. Tumko malum hona. Samajhta nahi kya\".<br /><br />I know i did do a mistake by not keeping the change with me, but what i didn't know was i did a blunder by not knowing that 10 bucks are considered as change. He was calling me a fool and i had no choice but to accept silently  that i am one. Then I thought thats not a big deal. Not him, then someone else would have fooled me out. So simply nodding in acceptance for what he said, I just  walked off. A thought just scribbled my mind, days are not far when a man will be called a fool for giving beggar a 10 rupee note.  For \"Chutta\" would have its value raised, with 10 bucks no longer being considered as change. A \"Beggar's delight\" or rather \"Beggar's dismay\"?

				"title": "\"Sachin not a Match Winner\": A judgement",
				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5944/1659/1600/017366.jpg\"><img style=\"float:left;cursor:pointer;margin:0 10px 10px 0;\" src=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/uploads/2020/2dd3905a13.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">I always come up with a statement &ldquo;Sachin is not a Match Winner&rdquo;. And if you try to go to the depth of the statement, you will find that the people mainly complain about following issues:</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">1) He never sails india to victory.</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">2) He is never there till the end.</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">3) He never strikes in a crucial stage.</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">4) He never plays well in finals.</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">5) He plays only on the Batsmen Friendly Indian Pitches</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">6) He is not like Lara, Steve Waugh or Bevan.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">Before we start looking at each issue, lets try to answer a couple of questions first:</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">1) Who is a Match Winner?</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">2) Can a single person win the matches for a country?</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">Ok so lets move to the first question. So is &ldquo;Match Winner&rdquo; the one who stays till the end? If that&rsquo;s the case then Srinath and Kumble were the match winners in the 3rd match of Titan Cup played against Australia on 21st October 1996. But still the man of the match award was given to the Sachin. Because he was holding one end of the indian innings when the greats like Dravid, Ganguly and Azar were making their way to pavalion. He was sailing India home with a great victory but for a good ball which he just happened to misjudge. This was the innings that created a base for the &ldquo;rare&rdquo; nice flicks from the two Bangaloreans and made them to take India to a fantastic win and they get full credit for doing it with perfection.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">Now lets consider a Test Match. Take the 2nd test of the Border-Gavaskar trophy played against Australia on 26-30 December 1999. The first innings of Australia saw 405 runs. Thanks to great innings by Slater, Langer, Gilchrist and even some fine knocks by Fleming and Lee down the order. India&rsquo;s 1st innings score was 238 which had a fine inning of 116 from the Little Master. He was the 9th man to get out. Then Australia scored 208 runs before declaring their second innings. In the responce, India just managed to score 195 runs again having an inning of 52 from Tendulkar. But then he could not sail india to victory at last. Still the man of the match was given to him. Can we imply from this test that Sachin was not a match winner as he didn&rsquo;t won the test for india? No we can&rsquo;t!!!!</span><br /><a href=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5944/1659/1600/0165731.jpg\"><img style=\"float:right;cursor:pointer;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/uploads/2020/e7d6dc622a.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">But then you again can&rsquo;t say that Sachin was the match winner in the First match we discussed. No he wasn&rsquo;t. On the contrary, no one can be a match winner in a team game like Cricket. You cannot neglect the support he got from Jadeja and Mongia that helped him to to take india on the verge of a win and then the nice flicks from Srinath and Kumble that sailed India to victory. You cannot forget even a small contribution of 30 odd runs in Cricket because that, with a partnership, counts big. Even in case of the test discussed, same thing would have happened if sachin would have got some support from his fellow teammates. The fault was not Sachin&rsquo;s — it was just that India could not find a Fleming/Lee who could score some runs down the order in the first innings.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">People may query &ldquo;why are you just considering these two innings?&rdquo; Or may be something like &ldquo;You are getting biased&rdquo;. But then I am not discussing the greatness of Sachin. I am just trying to judge the statement about match winner concept which I totally disbelieve exists. I think these facts are good enough to prove that the fist two issues can be discarded when you say he is not the match winner and very well answer the two questions we developed.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">So lets move to 3rd and 4th issues. I think these don&rsquo;t need to be discussed seperately as they are too similar. No situation can be more crucial than the final of a series. Here i will just like to ask one simple question. How many of these finals would india have reached but for Sachin? Does it not take some fine performances to win the matches which take us to the final? C&rsquo;mon man. After all he is an human being who too has got limits. Nobody in the world can be perfect and neither is Sachin. But the mere fact that he doesn&rsquo;t play in finals unlike few others (not Indians offcourse because i guess no indians play well in finals) doesn&rsquo;t reduce his briliance.</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">Or it can again not imply/disprove that he is not a match winner.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">The fifth query can be considered in two parts. 1) On Batsmen friendly pitches: Ok then i think this is a part of the game. Sachin is a batsmen and every batsmen is considered to play well on batsmen friendly pitches. But it will be wrong to say that he plays only on batsmen friendly tracks. Because he do have a few innings under his belt to disprove this statement including the ones at bulawayo and johannesburg against Zim and SA. Lets move to second part.</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">2)On Indian pithces: This statement will be best judged by few statistics which I will soon come up with.</span><br /><a href=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5944/1659/1600/024164.jpg\"><img style=\"float:left;cursor:pointer;margin:0 10px 10px 0;\" src=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/uploads/2020/cffef1f884.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">Lets move to the last and the most important comment. He is obviously not like Waugh, Lara, Inzi. He is far ahead of Waugh and Inzi and in case of Lara, I will just say its better not to judge one greats performance in the vision of the others. But I can say one thing. Sachin may not be a Steve Waugh but then he does not have a Warne, Gillespie or Lee who could win a match by hitting the last few runs after he scores a century. Lara and Waugh both had great teams to back their efforts, not just a few good players like what Sachin has. Tendulkar has shone as the lone gladiator for India.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">So I think everybody should stop worrying about who is a batter match winner and enjoy the game of all the greats. One thing is for sure. Today, when Sachin goes out to bat, he has over a billion people praying for him. So, whether he is a MATCH-WINNER or not, who cares: he is a HEART-WINNER. Today&rsquo;s great moments are tommorow&rsquo;s sweet memories. Though Dravid might be &ldquo;the great WALL of India&rdquo;, if you look beyond the wall you can see a monument, an &ldquo;Unconquerable Everest&rdquo;, in Sachin Tendulkar.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">In the end, I would just like to put a plain request to all those who debate on this topic. Just leave the man, who has given 14 years of his life to his passion, alone and don&rsquo;t put him under a microscope. This will sure help you enjoy the numerous innings he had played and the numerous he is yet to play. I CONGRATS THE LITTLE MASTER for all the fine innings he has played and wish him all the best for his remaining carrier. So bowlers beware.

And if you try to go to the depth of the statement, you will find that the people mainly complain about following issues:</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">1) He never sails india to victory.</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">2) He is never there till the end.</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">3) He never strikes in a crucial stage.</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">4) He never plays well in finals.</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">5) He plays only on the Batsmen Friendly Indian Pitches</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">6) He is not like Lara, Steve Waugh or Bevan.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">Before we start looking at each issue, lets try to answer a couple of questions first:</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">1) Who is a Match Winner?</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">2) Can a single person win the matches for a country?</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">Ok so lets move to the first question. So is \"Match Winner\" the one who stays till the end? If that's the case then Srinath and Kumble were the match winners in the 3rd match of Titan Cup played against Australia on 21st October 1996. But still the man of the match award was given to the Sachin. Because he was holding one end of the indian innings when the greats like Dravid, Ganguly and Azar were making their way to pavalion. He was sailing India home with a great victory but for a good ball which he just happened to misjudge. This was the innings that created a base for the \"rare\" nice flicks from the two Bangaloreans and made them to take India to a fantastic win and they get full credit for doing it with perfection.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">Now lets consider a Test Match. Take the 2nd test of the Border-Gavaskar trophy played against Australia on 26-30 December 1999. The first innings of Australia saw 405 runs. Thanks to great innings by Slater, Langer, Gilchrist and even some fine knocks by Fleming and Lee down the order. India's 1st innings score was 238 which had a fine inning of 116 from the Little Master. He was the 9th man to get out. Then Australia scored 208 runs before declaring their second innings. In the responce, India just managed to score 195 runs again having an inning of 52 from Tendulkar. But then he could not sail india to victory at last. Still the man of the match was given to him. Can we imply from this test that Sachin was not a match winner as he didn't won the test for india? No we can't!!!!</span><br /><a href=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5944/1659/1600/0165731.jpg\"><img style=\"float:right;cursor:pointer;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/uploads/2020/e7d6dc622a.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">But then you again can't say that Sachin was the match winner in the First match we discussed. No he wasn't. On the contrary, no one can be a match winner in a team game like Cricket. You cannot neglect the support he got from Jadeja and Mongia that helped him to to take india on the verge of a win and then the nice flicks from Srinath and Kumble that sailed India to victory. You cannot forget even a small contribution of 30 odd runs in Cricket because that, with a partnership, counts big. Even in case of the test discussed, same thing would have happened if sachin would have got some support from his fellow teammates. The fault was not Sachin's — it was just that India could not find a Fleming/Lee who could score some runs down the order in the first innings.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">People may query \"why are you just considering these two innings?\" Or may be something like \"You are getting biased\". But then I am not discussing the greatness of Sachin. I am just trying to judge the statement about match winner concept which I totally disbelieve exists. I think these facts are good enough to prove that the fist two issues can be discarded when you say he is not the match winner and very well answer the two questions we developed.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">So lets move to 3rd and 4th issues. I think these don't need to be discussed seperately as they are too similar. No situation can be more crucial than the final of a series. Here i will just like to ask one simple question. How many of these finals would india have reached but for Sachin? Does it not take some fine performances to win the matches which take us to the final? C'mon man. After all he is an human being who too has got limits. Nobody in the world can be perfect and neither is Sachin. But the mere fact that he doesn't play in finals unlike few others (not Indians offcourse because i guess no indians play well in finals) doesn't reduce his briliance.</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">Or it can again not imply/disprove that he is not a match winner.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">The fifth query can be considered in two parts. 1) On Batsmen friendly pitches: Ok then i think this is a part of the game. Sachin is a batsmen and every batsmen is considered to play well on batsmen friendly pitches. But it will be wrong to say that he plays only on batsmen friendly tracks. Because he do have a few innings under his belt to disprove this statement including the ones at bulawayo and johannesburg against Zim and SA. Lets move to second part.</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">2)On Indian pithces: This statement will be best judged by few statistics which I will soon come up with.</span><br /><a href=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5944/1659/1600/024164.jpg\"><img style=\"float:left;cursor:pointer;margin:0 10px 10px 0;\" src=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/uploads/2020/cffef1f884.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">Lets move to the last and the most important comment. He is obviously not like Waugh, Lara, Inzi. He is far ahead of Waugh and Inzi and in case of Lara, I will just say its better not to judge one greats performance in the vision of the others. But I can say one thing. Sachin may not be a Steve Waugh but then he does not have a Warne, Gillespie or Lee who could win a match by hitting the last few runs after he scores a century. Lara and Waugh both had great teams to back their efforts, not just a few good players like what Sachin has. Tendulkar has shone as the lone gladiator for India.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">So I think everybody should stop worrying about who is a batter match winner and enjoy the game of all the greats. One thing is for sure. Today, when Sachin goes out to bat, he has over a billion people praying for him. So, whether he is a MATCH-WINNER or not, who cares: he is a HEART-WINNER. Today's great moments are tommorow's sweet memories. Though Dravid might be \"the great WALL of India\", if you look beyond the wall you can see a monument, an \"Unconquerable Everest\", in Sachin Tendulkar.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);\">In the end, I would just like to put a plain request to all those who debate on this topic. Just leave the man, who has given 14 years of his life to his passion, alone and don't put him under a microscope. This will sure help you enjoy the numerous innings he had played and the numerous he is yet to play. I CONGRATS THE LITTLE MASTER for all the fine innings he has played and wish him all the best for his remaining carrier. So bowlers beware.
