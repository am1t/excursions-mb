<p>When writing, and also when doing research for writing, it‚Äôs important to get the details right, but that doesn‚Äôt always mean what you might think. Economy of detail is usually better than excess, which raises the critical question about which details matter most.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An insightful read this, <a href="https://mattgemmell.com/verisimilitude/">Verisimilitude by Matt Gemmell</a>. I found this suggestion really on the mark.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research is a distillation. You‚Äôll spend two hours reading, to get four paragraphs of notes, which provide eight words of story ‚Äî but those eight words will take the reader into the world you‚Äôve created, and create the impression that your character really is there, or really knows about this topic. Just make sure it‚Äôs either unremarkable that they would know those things, or that their knowledge has been explicitly accounted for.</p>

<p>While writing short stories that I based on some amount of research, I myself have struggled at times to know how much is enough. This was a good reminder from Matt.</p>

			 <p>A smartphone with a case is just not the same device. I have never used a device without a case ever. A slippery slab of fragile glass just doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable sitting in my hand.

Every device looks the same with a case on ‚Äî the camera bump, the notch, the punch-hole fail to help.</p>

<p>It had a brilliant premise ‚Äî unique and fascinating. However, I didn&rsquo;t enjoy the many turns it took in the second half.

			 <p>I have come across many guess-the-word games recently, mostly after Wordle. <a href="https://semantle.com/">Semantle</a> is another one, but is different in many ways. It&rsquo;s not limited in number of attempts. The help page says, &ldquo;You will need more than six guesses. You will probably need dozens of guesses&rdquo;. Sounds about right. Plus it has hints. Yet it feels difficult and exciting. Do give it a try when you have some time.</p>
<p>PS: It took me 21 guesses, 3 hints to get today&rsquo;s word.</p>

			 <p>I have released an upgrade (v1.1) to Paper theme for Micro.blog today that allows modifying the default behaviour of the homepage. It includes a setting now to display full post content on the homepage of the blog. Here‚Äôs how the homepage with this setting on will look like. You can also check the same on <a href="https://amit-test.micro.blog">my test blog</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is one of the most asked for features since the first release. I could never get the look right without ruining the spirit of the theme. Or so I like to believe because the change isn‚Äôt too significant in itself. So, irrespective of which option you decide to go with, the homepage should feel as part of the original simple and clean theme.</p>
<p>If you are using the Paper theme, look out for the upgrade option in Plugins. It should be enabled soon. As always, if you find any bug or want any improvements, kindly let me know either as <a href="https://github.com/am1t/microdotblog-paper/issues/new">GitHub issue</a> or connect with me on <a href="https://micro.blog/amit">Micro.blog</a> / via <a href="mailto:reply@amitgawande.com">email</a>.</p>

			 <p>I read a lot many long-form posts that are published with Substack these days. I know that‚Äôs anecdotal, but I wonder if Substack is becoming a blogging platform of choice for folks now. Or newsletters are newsletters no more? Well, what is a newsletter?</p>
<p>I like when a newsletter is more than just a list of links. Or a bowl of jumbled, unrelated recommendations. Not that I don‚Äôt enjoy them ‚Äî I appreciate the effort that goes in curating these best-of reads. I have found them useful many a time. But deep down, I <em>love</em> reading letters. It reminds me of the days when I used to post handwritten physical mails to my family and close friends. Those words had an innate charm and closeness. I enjoy a newsletter that‚Äôs a letter first.</p>
<p>That tangential thought aside, I believe Substack is a publishing platform for newsletters first. But given the way it is set up, it is also a publishing platform for the long-form posts. If you don‚Äôt subscribe to a publication, most probably you are going to read it as a blog post. That‚Äôs what seems to be happening to me.</p>

			 <p>With many avenues of tracking and improving my well-being already around me, I have decided to make the best use of them. I know I am not good at maintaining a healthy routine for any meaningful duration. Yet, I want to give myself another chance to succeed at forming one by constant nudges and tickles.</p>
<p>A reference to <a href="https://www.wholelifechallenge.com">Whole Life Challenge</a> (h/t <a href="https://www.cygnoir.net/2022/04/16/i-made-it.html">Halsted Bernard</a>) with its pointed question ‚ÄúWhat is healthy to you?‚Äù front and centre came in handy. The tagline, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt try to fit health and wellness into your life. Fit your life into the context of health and wellness‚Äù resonated with me. I always had the tools that allow me to track my progress towards a healthy lifestyle; with the recommendations from this challenge, I know what I need to track. I am not undertaking any challenge, but I am going to follow along.</p>
<p>So, I am tracking the seven habits ‚Äì nutrition, hydrate, exercise, mobilise, sleep, well-being and reflect. With health apps from Samsung and Google, I make note of everything I eat, being cognisant of my diet. I don‚Äôt want to cut down on anything yet, but just understand what goes in. Keeping myself hydrated is not a problem I face, I drink enough water regularly.</p>
<p>Though I already do the running and stretching pretty regularly, I am now consciously walking while carrying out the daily chores instead of riding my motor scooter. Though I can‚Äôt sleep with a watch on, I now manually enter my hours of sleep. Sure, I miss out on the detailed reports of my sleep pattern, but this is better than nothing. With the bedtime mode scheduled on my smartphone, the screen goes greyscale, reminding me to rid myself of the clingy device. It helps!</p>
<p>Building a habit for well-being has been difficult for me. Meditation, the only well-being activity that I know of, never stuck. I can meditate, but I don‚Äôt do this with the right spirit. A constant thought of ‚Äúam I doing this right‚Äù keeps pestering me throughout, and I know I‚Äôm <em>not</em> doing it right. Well, who knew there are other well-being practises too ‚Äì picking up a book, reaching out to a friend or organising a disheveled space. Ah, now <em>that</em> I can do. And do well.</p>
<p>All said, these are early days. I am just a week into tracking these habits and I have already missed out on a couple each day. (I am using a wonderfully simple app, Loop Habit Tracker, to track these). But I am allowing myself the leniency.</p>
<hr>
<p>This post was sent as an introduction for this week‚Äôs issue of <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/subscribe/">my weekly newsletter</a>. I have realized the updates I begin my newsletter with every week get lost once it is out. So I intend to publish these as individual posts also.</p>

This choice is driven by Samsung‚Äôs preference to make the pictures look better, clearer over Apple‚Äôs to make them look close to real. People who understand photography will always prefer the latter, the most of the mainstream will prefer the former.

<p>A tangential thought, what do you call the folks that are not experts? The non-reviewers. The enthusiasts. Or the nerds? These are the folks that form the majority market, ones that most companies target. I always struggle to find a term that isn‚Äôt derogatory to either side. I at times call them common folks, but it doesn‚Äôt sound right to me. Neither does ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ‚Äî that makes the tech enthusiasts, the group I belong to, non-normal? Again, doesn‚Äôt sound right. I recently heard someone call this section ‚Äúmuggles‚Äù. Yuck! Have people even read the books?</p>
<p>Anyway, back to my device selection. I have been part of the Apple ecosystem for a long time. When I recently switched to Android with a OnePlus device, I was worried that I may miss the benefits of the ecosystem. Well, I did. But not enough to make me go back to the Apple devices. With a Galaxy smartphone now, I had a chance to get back to an ecosystem of sorts again. Samsung has over the years build a viable alternative for each Apple device. A shameless copy initially, now all of them have an identity of their own. One such device is Galaxy Watch 4 which is different from Apple Watch, yet equally powerful when paired with a Galaxy smartphone. For the past week, I have been enjoying how both these devices work together. Samsung‚Äôs strategy looks to be working.</p>

			 <p>I had no idea Pebble (or at least part of it) was purchased by Fitbit. Almost 6 years back. So unfortunate we didn‚Äôt see any launches of inspired products from Fitbit. One with an e-paper display and good battery life. I would have loved such a device.</p>

			 <p>I can‚Äôt remember the last time I enjoyed listening to a book as much as I did <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary">Project Hail Mary</a> by Andy Weir. Of course, Weir deserves a lot of credit for writing such a smart book. But I am equally impressed by the performance, the voice acting by Ray Porter. I have rarely listened to an audiobook where I can‚Äôt separate the narrator and the central character in the book. Most of the folks read the book, performing the dialogs by characters differently every now and then. That wasn‚Äôt the case with Porter ‚Äî he became the character Ryland Grace. The experience it leaves the listener with is absolutely brilliant. I could ignore many of the faults of the book, the plot because I was completely engrossed by the performance.</p>
<p>Sure, even the book is good. I can‚Äôt say the same for the writing. But who cares. There‚Äôs an innate charm with the way Weir writes his books. Or the way he structures his plot. There‚Äôs a lot of science that‚Äôs hard to swallow, at times almost at the verge of being stupid. Yet, it doesn‚Äôt come out as lazy to me. And I am not alone to feel so; Brandon Sanderson <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/project-hail-mary-review/">writes this in his review</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, what I love that Andy does is he shows that optimism can be compelling as a narrative. I don‚Äôt mind the grimdark movement. I think there‚Äôs lots of great books that have come out of it. And I like dystopian science fiction quite a bit. Some of my favorite stories are very depressing dystopian stories, such as Harrison Bergeron. But there is a certain electric-fun to optimism. And Andy Weir writes optimistic science fiction, optimistic hard science fiction, even when terrible things are happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don‚Äôt think I can word the way I feel about Weir‚Äôs writing any better. He did that successfully with Martian. And he outdoes himself by being even more audacious with Project Hail Mary.</p>
<p>The book gets four star from me. And an added star just for Roy. No surprise, it‚Äôs rated (almost) five star on Audible. Absolutely brilliant!</p>

			 <p>This week saw the schools and offices welcoming the students and employees in-person, and I realised I have entered the post-lockdown phase of the pandemic now. For a body and mind that has gotten used to the sluggish at-home routine, the rush-filled days are exhausting. I haven‚Äôt gotten used to this routine yet.</p>
<p>It isn‚Äôt as if I am working more. Rather, I must be working a lot less than what I was when I could focus more at home. For the majority of the times, that is. But the mere fact that I am at the office floors surrounded by the buzzing coworker space makes the stay tiring. I can see the same behaviour in my daughter. She was extremely pumped to join the school, and still is. However, even she is drained once she arrives home from the school. Well, her reason might be different ‚Äì surrounded by friends new and old, she is bursting with energy. She has missed her classrooms. And the busy routine. There‚Äôs satisfaction on her tired face.</p>
<p>Is it all bad for me? Well, to be frank, not at all. I have enjoyed the company of coworkers in the last week. The way we work when we can interact face-to-face is very different from when it is all virtual. We take many decisions without planning and booking a time on the calendar; as a result, we close more discussions. The virtual mode of working restrained us through the need to over-plan. Over-schedule. It‚Äôs surprising how free I felt when I could simply walk to a person and talk.</p>
<p>Sure, the away-from-home routine has impacted my reading and writing habits, too. Well, to be frank, those habits are impacted for quite some time now. I need to get back, find a window to think in this hectic, unsteady life. It‚Äôs not new to me, but it‚Äôs funny how a couple of years at home has made me forget the office lifestyle. What was the work-life balance that we talked so much about, again?</p>
<p>Well, that‚Äôs a thought to ponder over some other time.</p>

			 <p>iPhone SE is a lazy upgrade ‚Äî Apple is a boring company. If there is one thing that will dent the juggernaut that is Apple, it is their tendency to play safe to cater to the majority. <em>We need to sell in millions, so we can‚Äôt experiment too much on design.</em> I understand the why. Consumer aren‚Äôt supposed to care.</p>
<p>The strategy might work in US. Apple might throw numbers to prove that SE sells well worldwide. But all they are doing is to keep a manufacturing unit running since last 2014.</p>
<p>India is an extremely competitive market on price and I am tired of waiting for Apple to price their low end devices well.</p>
<p>SE needs a better, modern design. Be bold and make one custom for smaller devices. Or stay lazy and make iPhone 12 mini your new SE. Or if that&rsquo;s too premium, make iPhone 11 the new SE. But kill those bezels already.</p>

			 <p>I have recently been a lot picky about the stuff I buy. Or the subscriptions I sign up for. Or the projects I undertake. I was never good at it. And I don‚Äôt claim that I have mastered the skill now. I still struggle to recognise the price that I would eventually have to pay. First look, the listed cost looks cheap. But I have started asking now, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2022/01/everything-must-be-paid-for-twice/">can I pay the second price</a>?‚Äù</p>
<p>The answer is usually <em>a big no</em>. David Cain succinctly words the reasons behind this problem of mine (the above linked essay is a must-read).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe this is one reason our modern lifestyles can feel a little self-defeating sometimes. In our search for fulfillment, we keep paying first prices, creating a correspondingly enormous debt of unpaid second prices. Yet the rewards of any purchase ‚Äì the reason we buy it at all ‚Äî stay locked up until both prices are paid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could also closely associate with the side effects of this problem, as David lists them. This made me acutely aware of the gravity of this pilling debt.</p>

<p>This scarcity feeling creates one of the major side-effects of our insurmountable second-price debt: we reflexively overindulge in entertainment and other low-second-price pleasures ‚Äì- phone apps, streaming services, and processed food ‚Äî even though their rewards are often only marginally better than doing nothing. This stuff is attractive because it takes little effort (and we‚Äôre tired from working to pay for so many first prices) but it can eat up a ton of time, depleting the second-price budget even further.</p>

			 <p>Last week was about hope and shattered dreams. It was a lesson in staying positive amidst all the roadblocks and pushbacks. It began with, on the personal front, hopes for a better, different tomorrow ‚Äî but as the week drew closer to the end, I was made aware that there‚Äôs still a lot of work to do. That I am not ‚Äúworthy‚Äù of this better tomorrow yet. I know I am. But after a point, all you can do is stay positive. Stay prepared for the time when the tide invariably will turn.</p>
<p>Staying prepared is all we did. I wish I could dwell more into details. But I cannot.</p>
<p>Talking about the week, my daughter had her culmination day in her school. She was already saddened that it was online, not in person. Online schooling has overstayed its welcome now; she longs to visit the physical school. She misses her friends and her routine when she is surrounded by a learning environment. Staring at a computer screen with teachers and friends peering back at her is not her definition of involved learning. I am proud of how effectively she has managed schooling for the past 2 years. But I feel for her.</p>
<p>Anyway, she had to talk about a topic which she prepared well for and yet was extremely nervous about. The ill-timed power loss and resultant network drop made it even more terrible experience for her than what she feared. She stayed positive, joined from an iPad with a mobile hotspot. She gave her best, but she had already lost half her interest. All I and my wife could do was to explain how it was nothing to get disheartened about, to make her look at the positives. But I knew deep down that she is no longer enjoying this digital form of schooling.</p>
<p>‚Äî</p>
<p>This post was sent as an introduction for this week&rsquo;s issue of <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/subscribe/">my weekly newsletter</a>. I have realized the updates I begin my newsletter with every week get lost once it is out. So I publish these as individual posts.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Micro.blog is a blogging platform built over Hugo, a fast static site engine. Given the way it is structured, every theme created for Hugo can potentially work with the blog hosted by Micro.blog. However, there are a few aspects added to Hugo that are specific to the way things work in Micro.blog. These need to be included as part of the themes to make the most of the features of this platform.</p>
<p>This article presents a non-extensive list of things that should be evaluated and included while porting a theme that is made for Hugo to Micro.blog. I have written this as I dug into the existing themes <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/01/23/paper-a-clean.html">while porting Paper theme</a>. As of this writing, a theme is considered as a plug-in in Micro.blog. Hence, many references link back to the way plug-ins work with the platform.</p>
<p>To reiterate, this is not an extensive list. Based on how a theme, that is being ported, is set up, one may need only a few of these steps or may need a few more than those listed below. However, this should be a good start to get a working version of the theme out for testing. If there are any issues or concerns, please reply to our email addresses.</p>
<h2 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h2>
<p>Of course, the article assumes that you have already identified the theme that you want to port. The <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io">Hugo theme Showcase</a> is a good place to check for all the wonderful themes available.</p>
<p>Though you are not required to have a detailed understanding of Hugo to port a theme, the knowledge on the below aspects should be handy.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-themes/59">Custom Theme support in Micro.blog</a></li>
<li>A basic understanding of <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/">Hugo templates</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/">directory structure</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>The first step to get started is to access and clone the repository of the theme to be ported. You can either do this offline on your desktop or directly create a new theme in Micro.blog with mentioning the theme repository URL as Clone URL. You could then select this newly added theme as a custom theme for your <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/09/04/microblog-test-blogs.html">test blog</a>. This allows you to find out what breaks and also validate the additional modifications that you make to the theme.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For a theme to work, you only need a few folders and files ‚Äî a typical Micro.blog theme directory structure is provided below for reference.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ theme.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ static
</code></pre><ul>
<li><code>theme.toml</code> - Contains bare meta information about the theme, like name, description, license, features, author.</li>
<li><code>config.json</code> - Contains any properties required and referenced by the template files of the theme. If the property is to be provided by the user, typically it should be taken as a setting, defined in a separate file.</li>
<li><code>plugin.json</code> - Contains meta information about the custom theme to be displayed as part of plugin repository. It also defines the feature settings that can be provided by user while plugin configuration. Refer to <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/plug-ins/104">official guide on plug-ins</a> for more details about this file.</li>
<li><code>layouts</code> - A folder that stores <code>html</code> templates that defines how views of different content types will be rendered on a website with the style.</li>
<li><code>static</code> - A folder that stores all the static content like CSS, JavaScript, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get rid of all the other unnecessary files and folders and only keep the above-mentioned ones. This will keep the list of files in which changes are to be made manageable.</p>
<p>Before we move ahead, here‚Äôs a list of basic template files in the <code>layouts</code> folders that one would modify typically to port a theme.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/_default/list.html</code> - A template that renders pages with multiple pieces of content, this includes the homepage. A homepage can also be independently styled by defining a template <code>index.html</code> in the root directory.</li>
<li><code>/_default/single.html</code> or <code>posts/single.html</code> - A template that renders a page for a single post.</li>
<li><code>/_default/list.archivehtml.html</code> - A template that renders the archive page of your website.</li>
<li><code>/partials/head.html</code> - A template that defines the <code>head</code> section of your final rendered HTML.</li>
<li><code>/partials/header.html</code> - A template that defines the header of your blog. This typically includes the site title, subtitle, navigation menu etc.</li>
<li><code>/partials/footer.html</code> - A template that defines the footer of your blog. This typically includes the copyrights, author information etc.</li>
<li><code>/_default/baseof.html</code> - A base template that stitches all the above defined partials together, including the main sections defined in list and single template pages above.</li>
</ul>
<p>A theme might have all the above files, or have just a subset of these. In case a theme does not provide a particular template file, one from the basic theme (which forms the base of every theme) of Micro.blog is used.</p>
<p>Moreover, make sure you configure the appropriate Hugo Version to be used for your blog. Micro.blog allows two versions of Hugo to be used, 0.54 and 0.91, the latest being relatively new. Many themes may not work with the older 0.54 version of the Hugo, typically indicated by the <code>min_version</code> configuration in the <code>theme.toml</code>. If the value is above 0.54, set the Hugo version to be used as 0.91. This can be done via Design ‚Üí Hugo Version.</p>
<h2 id="fix-the-broken-pages">Fix the Broken Pages</h2>
<p>Usually, the home page might not render the list of all the posts with the ported templates. This is often due to the wrong selection of the posts. To check the selection, visit the list template mentioned above and fix the file which is fetching all the posts. It should typically look like below where you pull all the regular pages where type is defined as post.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{{ $pages = where .Site.RegularPages &quot;Type&quot; &quot;post&quot; }}
</code></pre><p>A similar fix would also need to be applied to the archive page‚Äôs template, if it is defined custom. The archive page would also need styling the components appropriately, as these are all Micro.blog specific classes, not part of the default styling of the theme.</p>
<p>Next, you will have to fix the templates to handle the title-less posts. Most posts published with Micro.blog are, well, micro-posts with no titles. So, wherever a Title is referenced, it should be wrapped in a <code>&amp;#123;&amp;#123; if .Title }}</code> condition. So, the title reference at every place should read like below.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{{ if .Title }}
	&lt;h2&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/h2&gt;
{{ end }}
</code></pre><p>The title-less posts might also need minor styling fixes. A typical pitfall is when a post permalink is only available with title. So, a micro-post requires a different element to carry the permalink, mostly the date-time of the post.</p>
<p>Another aspect that is typically broken is rendering of the taxonomy. Most of the themes in Hugo use tags to define the taxonomy. Micro.blog uses categories and hence need to fetch them differently. So at every place a template mentions tags, mostly on list template, archives template and single template, replace them with categories. This primarily involves replacing all the references of <code>.Params.tags</code> with <code>.Params.categories</code>.</p>
<p>With these changes handled, you should have a working website that renders correctly. However, it is still not customised to include the benefits that Micro.blog brings to the table.</p>
<h2 id="add-microblog-specific-tags">Add Micro.blog Specific Tags</h2>
<p>Micro.blog packs the key IndieWeb principles, like IndieAuth, MicroPub, Webmentions, out-of-box for all websites hosted with the platform. However, this does involve defining a few relevant aspects at appropriate places. In addition, the platform is also rich in the ways a user not adept with coding can customise their website to their liking, with support for providing custom CSS, footer and plug-ins. Enabling these also need relevant components to be defined.</p>
<p>The changes to be made are in two files. First, modify the partials template that defines the head section of your website, <code>/partials/head.html</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;{{ &quot;custom.css&quot; | relURL }}?{{ .Site.Params.theme_seconds }}&quot;&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;me&quot; href=&quot;https://micro.blog/{{ .Site.Author.username }}&quot; /&gt;
{{ with .Site.Params.twitter_username }}
	&lt;link rel=&quot;me&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/{{ . }}&quot; /&gt;
{{ end }}
{{ with .Site.Params.github_username }}
	&lt;link rel=&quot;me&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/{{ . }}&quot; /&gt;
{{ end }}
{{ with .Site.Params.instagram_username }}
	&lt;link rel=&quot;me&quot; href=&quot;https://instagram.com/{{ . }}&quot; /&gt;
{{ end }}

&lt;link rel=&quot;authorization_endpoint&quot; href=&quot;https://micro.blog/indieauth/auth&quot; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;token_endpoint&quot; href=&quot;https://micro.blog/indieauth/token&quot; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;micropub&quot; href=&quot;https://micro.blog/micropub&quot; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;microsub&quot; href=&quot;https://micro.blog/microsub&quot; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;webmention&quot; href=&quot;https://micro.blog/webmention&quot; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;subscribe&quot; href=&quot;https://micro.blog/users/follow&quot; /&gt;

{{ range .Site.Params.plugins_css }}
	&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;{{ . }}&quot; /&gt;
{{ end }}
{{ range $filename := .Site.Params.plugins_html }}
	{{ partial $filename $ }}
{{ end }}
</code></pre><p>Next, add the below lines to the end of your base template, <code>/_default/baseof.html</code> just before <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>. These load the custom footer and the plug-ins defined JavaScripts.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{{ partial &quot;custom_footer.html&quot; . }}

{{ range .Site.Params.plugins_js }}
	&lt;script src=&quot;{{ . }}&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
{{ end }}
</code></pre><h2 id="display-replies-as-conversations">Display Replies as Conversations</h2>
<p>Micro.blog allows including replies made on the posts to be shown as conversations on a post page via a design setting (Design ‚Üí Include conversation on post page). However, for the replies to be rendered on your post page, you need to modify your single template, <code>/_default/single.html</code> or <code>posts/single.html</code>, and add the below lines at the end.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{{ if .Site.Params.include_conversation }}
	&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://micro.blog/conversation.js?url={{ .Permalink }}&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
{{ end }}
</code></pre><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The difficulty involved in porting a Hugo theme to Micro.blog depends completely on the complexity of the original theme. Though it is difficult to extensively cover all the changes required, fixing the things that are broken and adding support for the Micro.blog specific features and tags is all it takes. This article attempted to list down the majority of the identified changes.</p>
<p>In the future, the way of including the Micro.blog specific changes may be simplified significantly. This article would be updated accordingly to reflect the same. However, the awareness of the changes being done allows one to appreciate the hidden complexity and beauty of the platform that is Micro.blog.</p>

			 <p>I find <a href="https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/historyculture/douglas-corrigan.htm">the story of Douglas Corrigan</a> pretty fascinating and inspiring. Sometimes the wrong way is the right way. All that matters is your intention and people‚Äôs perception.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having flown his nine year-old, $900 Curtiss Robin to New York, Corrigan fueled up and took off after announcing that he planned to return to Los Angeles. When next heard from, Corrigan and his old plane were in Dublin, Ireland, where he said, &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Corrigan. I left New York yesterday morning headed for California, but I got mixed up in the clouds and must have flown the wrong way.&rdquo; And so was born the wry legend of &ldquo;Wrong Way&rdquo; Corrigan.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have settled on a platform for my blog which works the best for me ‚Äî Micro.blog. There are reasons why the other platforms don&rsquo;t interest me. And I want to talk about them. Why now, you say? Well, recent and sudden interest in the Write.as platform among the folks I follow the words from made me momentarily pause. So here&rsquo;s the write up, first on why what in Micro.blog works for me.</p>
<p>For starter, it suits well for both the micro and long-form posts. It has apps for all platforms that I primarily use Mac and Android (Web is good for Windows, though I would still love an app there). Quick notes are best made with the apps, especially so from smartphone. For such posts that are long, titled, Ulysses works perfectly well for me. No other CMS can ever work as well as a native application.</p>
<p>The platform is built on Hugo. And I <em>love</em> Hugo. I hosted my blog for the longest with Hugo. I love the submodule systems with Hugo. Building extensions in your templates is so easy, and I have gotten comfortable with it. For a few, it might be <code>PHP</code> and WordPress. However, I could never get comfortable with that.</p>
<p>Manton has added just enough around Hugo to make it even more useful ‚Äî the APIs, the apps, the social aspects, the open plug-in and theming systems and, the most valuable, its community. I visit the platform for inspiration, and many posts start right there. All this makes Micro.blog a lot more powerful, getting rid of the issues I had with Hugo, mainly the editing workflow with the static site. And I am not even talking about the smarter features life filters, bookmarks, microcasts, newsletters and bookshelves.</p>
<p>Do I use all of them? Of course, not. But the fact that one plan provides me so much over and above the basic blogging functionality is priceless for me.</p>
<h3 id="but-what-about-other-platforms">But what about other platforms?</h3>
<p>I have hopped through a lot more platforms than what I am proud of. So, I know what works, and doesn‚Äôt work for me. Let me be brief and focus only on what doesn‚Äôt work for me with the most frequently talked ones. I don‚Äôt want to consider the costing aspects ‚Äî I can work a way to use them so that they cost effectively the same.</p>
<p>The below notes also give me a ready reference when I get lured by a new platform next time.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress</a> is too busy, too bloated for my liking. I don‚Äôt like the CMS. I don‚Äôt like the themes. For my style of blogging, frequent quick posts than scheduled thought-out essays, the options and features become a hinderance. I don‚Äôt want to think about the title or the tags or the categories or the url. Or excerpt. Sure, I can customise this system just to get it right. But I don‚Äôt know (neither do I like) <code>PHP</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> blog looks pretty. Polished. Majority of my posts aren‚Äôt that. And again, it bundles too many features that I just can‚Äôt connect with. I am not a media publishing house trying to build a business with my blog. I am a dumb person with very basic needs. No ‚Äúaudience‚Äù. No business.</p>
<p><a href="https://blot.im">Blot</a> is brilliant. Another of those services I have a lot of love for, driven also from my respect to David, the mind behind the service. A brilliant guy, just like his service. But my editing workflow is just not files driven. When I write, I don‚Äôt always do that in my text editor. I want a web editor. I want apps. And, having said that, I also want text editors. Not something that Blot supports currently. For some, that‚Äôs the ultimate selling point of the service. Not for me.</p>
<p>What about <a href="http://write.as/">Write.as</a>, the recent entrant? Well, I like the service. I like the simplicity of the editor (I wish Manton got inspired from this one). But it feels far too fragmented. Each feature is a different product. I had noted this recently about the service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I land on a page which is a blank one with a blinking cursor. Brilliant! But what next? There&rsquo;s nothing else if you don&rsquo;t know where to go. I can see my blog posts, edit them. Do you want the community? There is a different product. Pictures you say? That&rsquo;s another different product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The workflow is not natural to me. It is a nice, easy service. But it doesn‚Äôt work for me. Plus, it lacks the app support. Without mobile apps, I just can‚Äôt publish those quick notes anymore.</p>
<p>Of course, I could pick and choose, make multiple platforms host different types of posts for me. I have done that. But I have realised, after a lot of pain, that it‚Äôs another hurdle in my posting workflow. Any decision my mind is to make before publishing slows it down, killing my writing productivity completely.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it‚Äôs a wonderful time to be blogging again. There‚Äôs such a rich set of platforms that can suit every writer‚Äôs style. For me, though, Micro.blog works the best, and I am going to stick with it for now. Does that mean I will <em>never</em> consider new or even the above platforms? Well, knowing me, I can never say never.</p>

			 <p>Last week, my whole family, near and distant, got together for my cousin‚Äôs wedding, and it kept me completely exhausted throughout this week. The venue for the wedding was unfamiliar to me and I am never comfortable at such places. I can never settle into any routinue of sorts, messing up my eating and sleeping habits, and invariably my body. The journey with a train to and from the destination, though, was wonderful. I have always had a fascination for the train rides, especially ones overnight. To be a resident of a world on wheels for a few hours is welcome ‚Äî it distances you from all your regular thoughts. Each station the train halts at exhibits a different personality, lays out its own unique beauty for the traveling strangers. The <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/02/05/a-morning-during.html">skies in the dawns remain beautiful</a>, the vacant stations late at nights are equally mesmerising.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All said, notwithstanding the tiredness the event left me with, the train ride gave me enough memories to remember the two nights of the journey by. The week also saw me complete another of my <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/categories/30-day/">#30day</a> challenges. I am proud of this one, I learned so much. And I might have continued the challenge if it wasn‚Äôt for the hectic week. I will not, however, take photo-a-day as a challenge now. I want to make it regular, part of my blogging habit.</p>
<p>What #30day challenge should I sign up for next, then? Anyway, last week was a slow writing week in terms of number of posts. But in terms of number of words, I wrote more than what‚Äôs usual for me.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Respected Mr. Gaitonde,</p>
<p>I have reached Tikwadi. As I had promised you in our last meeting when you had unnecessarily criticised me for the lack of seriousness, I have taken this job extremely seriously. Let me be extremely clear; your ultimatum that if I do not work sensibly very soon will lead to me losing my job had nothing to do with the deftness with which I have decided to travel.</p>
<p>Anyway, things are absolutely fine here in Tikwadi. There have been no untoward events until now. I think the villagers had unnecessarily raised an alarm. A day comes. The night follows. And days go by so without anything eventful happening. No murders, no aliens, no ghosts. Not that I am afraid of any of these. For that matter, I do not even believe in such laughable charades.</p>
<p>Overall, the town is beautiful. The people are also beautiful. Not the women &ndash; I mean, I am not saying the women are not beautiful. I mean, that does not matter to me. Undoubtedly, though, each one is uniquely crazy. Again, not that it matters much to me &ndash; I mean, the job matters to me. But the fact that the town is batshit crazy does not affect me.</p>
<p>I hope you know what I mean. I will report when something eventful happens. The people are waiting for me for a game of cricket. Football is with me.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity you gave me. Agent Raghu signing off.</p>
<hr>
<p>Dear Gaitonde,</p>
<p>Here I am, reporting to you again from Tikwadi. I will be very crisp this time, as you had said in your letter. I know I wrote numerous unnecessary things in my letter the last time. But my only intention was to let you know how normal the things were. There wasn‚Äôt any other hidden agenda. I won‚Äôt say your quip that ‚Äúyou are not on a picnic there‚Äù did not hurt me. It did ‚Ä¶ I mean just a bit. Not enough to impact my job. You can be assured about that.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the town does not seem as normal as I had reported the last time. There have been some sightings. Or so the crazy, frightened villagers say. I &ndash; let me assure you again &ndash; am not afraid at all. Just to be absolutely safe, I am just avoiding going to the areas from where the sightings have been reported. It is not because I am afraid. It is just to make sure you continue to get the reports from Tikwadi that you so dearly look out for. If something, anything, happens to me, I do not think it would be straightforward to find an equally qualified agent. I know you told me the last time to not call myself that. But this time it is not the post I am referring to. I use it as a common noun, and it is in that respect I call myself an agent. I am sure the kind heart of yours wouldn‚Äôt mind that.</p>
<p>Anyway, there is nothing to get very excited or scared about. Sure, the villagers are lunatic. I have no second thought in my mind about that. Furthermore, the town is not at all beautiful; it is miserable rather. The streetlights have no lights in them. The fans leak more noise than the air. Of course, both are true when there is electricity. Can you do something about these power cuts? I know I am an essential part of your team, and you respect me immensely. So, I am sure you would do that much for me. On a positive note, nature is, no doubt, beautiful. And some people are beautiful, beautiful as in not crazy. I only talk to these people regularly. I want to make sure I do not lose my smartness here.</p>
<p>Anyway, I will keep reporting if there are any more sightings or events. Gauri is calling me. She is beautiful. I mean, not that it matters to me.</p>
<p>Signing off. Raghu.</p>
<hr>
<p>Gaitonde,</p>
<p>I hate you. Why the bloody fuck did you send me to this idiot town. I am no agent. You should have told me that in extremely clear terms. ‚ÄúYou are not an agent, but only our representative‚Äù is not clear enough. I checked the Webster dictionary; one of the synonyms of agents is ‚Äúrepresentative‚Äù, you moron.</p>
<p>I do not know if it is the town that makes people crazy here, or it is the people who make this town crazy. The dimwits continue to run at me wherever they see me with the reports of the sightings. Some see ghosts. Some see aliens. The idiots tell me the most terrifying tales and leave me alone. They do not even realise I need to live alone after they go.</p>
<p>There is nothing worth reporting from this windswept town. Have you ever seen a ghost, Gaitonde? I am sure you won‚Äôt know if you have; because they bloody look the same. The Gauri I mentioned in my last letter? They tell me there never was any Gauri in the town. I was naively planning to propose to her very soon; of course, once I complete this job for you. Now I don&rsquo;t even know who is real and who is ghostly. I keep getting slapped as I pull on their moustaches and their hair, just to confirm.</p>
<p>I am done being your agent. Call me back. If you can‚Äôt get electricity to this town, a request that you so mercilessly thwarted, at least get me a car.</p>
<p>Raghu</p>

			 <p>I replaced my glasses today after going through the tiring trouble of shopping for them. There is no other process for me that‚Äôs so meaningless. What‚Äôs the most important thing in a spectacle? The lenses. How much percentage of time do I spend on deciding on the lens? Not more than 5%.</p>
<p>And shopping for the eyeglass frame then is <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2018/10/07/131400.html">shopping</a> <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2019/10/05/234000.html">for fashion</a>, which I have no sense for. What I like, I am told, doesn‚Äôt look good on me. It‚Äôs either too big. Or too small. What I am told looks good, I am not comfortable wearing that. Tired, I purchase one from whatever remains. <em>What are clothes for if not just for covering my body</em>, my brain consoles my crying mind each time.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs how my shopping for a frame for my glasses goes. <em>What is the frame for if not just for holding the lenses within</em>.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m spending too much time passively reading through the timelines, especially Micro.blog as it&rsquo;s both my blog host and the social platform I enjoy hanging out at.

			 <p>I have settled onto an easy workflow for publishing newsletters with Micro.blog. Another issue for <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/subscribe/">Excursions Weekly</a> went out today and the editing process was the most frictionless till date. I do wish though that there was an archive of the issues that I could share with the subscribers so that they know what they are signing up for.</p>
<p>Also, unfortunately the issue with the replies bouncing back has still not been fixed. Without that, I have no way to connect with the readers.</p>
<p>The way things stand, the support for newsletter in Micro.blog is extremely bare today. But the workflow remains one that I am most comfortable with. I just wish a few things were different and better.</p>

			 <p>I have been busy tinkering with many things these last few days. I don‚Äôt like when this happens because I halt everything else. I don‚Äôt read ‚Äî that invariably leads to me writing less. My routine is completely messed up. <em>No early to bed and early to rise</em>. I stay awake unnecessarily, and when I eventually sleep, it is with a mind full of thoughts, working on stuff yet undone. No surprise, the sleep is not peaceful.</p>
<p>I cozy up to all the bad habits. No control on eating or control on my smartphone usage. Every good habit that was picked up is forgotten again. Yikes!</p>
<p>I find it curious that being productive mars my health more often. I need to learn to shut myself down on time. Learn to say no to additional work, notwithstanding the fun I am having.</p>

			 <p>I have released a new <strong>version 1.0.2</strong> of the <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/43">Paper theme</a> today, which addresses the reported issues and suggestions <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/01/23/paper-a-clean.html">since the first release yesterday</a>. Here are the changes, in brief.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support to include replies on individual posts</li>
<li>Added the configuration of social icons as plug-in setting</li>
<li>Updated the styling to display categories along with posts</li>
<li>Updated documentation to include installation steps</li>
<li>Fixed styling of images on smaller screens</li>
</ul>
<p>You can go to the Plug-ins section in Micro.blog and click ‚ÄúUpgrade‚Äù once the option is available. You will have to reconfigure (<em>for the last time, hopefully</em>) the social IDs in the settings of the plug-in. No need to modify the <code>config.json</code>, anymore. This also means the configurations will not be lost during the future upgrades.</p>
<p>I am thrilled with all the feedback that I have received. Paper is a beautifully designed theme, something I can take no credit for. At the same time, I am glad I could make it simpler for others to adopt it.</p>

			 <p>After playing around briefly to understand how to bring a theme made for Hugo to Micro.blog, I have finally ported one that I love. Today, I am ready to share it with the Micro.blog community. The theme is called <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/43">Paper</a> and goes with a tagline ‚Äúsimple, clean, flexible‚Äù. You can check for yourself in the screenshot below, or see it live at <a href="https://amit-test.micro.blog">my test blog</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I am a big fan of clean themes that are minimal, yet impressive. Paper is one such theme ‚Äî I had used it earlier when I was hosting this blog with Hugo. Although it looks minimal, it isn‚Äôt so in the way it works. It has a simple, yet signature header, a built-in dark mode support with a beautiful toggle and a clean <em>black &amp; white</em> look.</p>
<p>I have added the first version of this theme to the plug-ins directory so that you can <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/43">install it directly as a plugin</a>. <del>It works with both Hugo versions that Micro.blog supports (0.54 and 0.91)</del> [<strong>Update</strong>]: An issue was reported while using the theme with Hugo version 0.54. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, until further update, the theme supports only version 0.91 of Hugo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. However, here are a few points to remember before you install the theme.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uninstall any theme that you have installed as a plugin. Set you current theme to blank and Hugo Version to 0.91 in the design section of your blog. Make sure there are no other conflicting custom CSS configured for the previous theme. Then install the Paper theme from the plugin directory. Once the theme is successfully installed, you can configure the social icons displayed in the header by modifying the available options in <code>config.json</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There‚Äôs already a brilliant selection of themes available for Micro.blog and I am excited to see the support grow further with every passing day. I hope you like this and a few folks benefit from it. If you do, I would love to hear from you.</p>

			 <p>After a phase of consistent writing, these are a silent few days. I have been busy a lot. Too many threads. Too many things at the top of my mind. Writing hasn‚Äôt slowed down, I am filling pages of my journal every day. But publishing has almost halted. Except for the <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/categories/30-day/">#30day</a> posts.</p>
<p>I love how when the mind gets bogged down with too many thoughts, spilling it all out onto a paper always helps declutter it. But, these are some of the rawest, most personal of the thoughts.

			 <p>Everything, some might say. But such barbs might not help identify and address the core issue.</p>
<p>For the past few days, I have read a lot of posts where people describe why they are quitting social media ‚Äî Facebook, Instagram, and the peskiest of all, Twitter; I empathise with the stories they are narrating. The wasted hours or the effects of doom-scrolling or an overall sense of negativity, helplessness. Colin Devroe <a href="http://cdevroe.com/2022/01/05/bye-social-media/">describes well</a> how these platforms have affected his ability to focus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]hen I‚Äôm still, when I‚Äôm idle, when I feel like I could be bored at any moment I grab my phone and scroll through Twitter which sends my mind into overdrive on a million topics, timelines, thoughts, and emotions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I get all of that. But my train of thoughts takes a slightly different turn, and I am left pondering what exactly do I find problematic about social media platforms.</p>
<p>Is it the timeline? If that‚Äôs the case, why is YouTube a concern? Is it the recommendations feed? If that‚Äôs the case, why is the chronological timeline on Twitter still pesky? Is it the trends? Well, why is the curated Instagram an issue? None of these is problematic in isolation. The effect that all of them put together have on me is the concern.</p>
<h3 id="passive-consumption-hurts-me-more">Passive consumption hurts me more</h3>
<p>I have realised that social media platforms lead users towards passive consumption. They benefit from their ability to make meaningless interactions pleasing. Or at least engaging. All the concerns I have stem from this ‚Äúuser-engagement-at-all-cost‚Äù business practice. Irrespective of how pleasing this interaction feels in the moment, it leaves me furious for the time wasted.</p>
<p>Twitter timeline is prone to do that. YouTube homepage does that, and so does their recommendation engine. Instagram, Facebook feeds do that. For me, even the Reddit forums tend to do that. Debatable, but <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2018/10/15/230500.html">Podcasts do that</a> too. And to top it all, my smartphone does this to the worst effect.</p>
<p>In short, meaningless interactions with any service or device is a problem. Passive consumption it leads to leaves me exhausted, feeling shit.</p>
<p>That is why a community like Micro.blog is not generally on such lists. The timeline component of Micro.blog, even though Manton has designed it to be different from Twitter and its ilk, is social media. But given the nature of the community, the interactions tend to inspire me to create, to act. Be opposite of passive. Even then, the timeline on my smartphone still causes me to waste time. It makes me pull down incessantly, subconsciously, and refresh. To check for more posts to interact with. <em>The pull-down-to-refresh has to be the most unhealthy use of our thumbs.</em></p>
<p>I had this issue identified some time back. It quit the social media that was useless to me, Facebook. I put control on those I use, Micro.blog and Twitter. It is their hunger to make me mindlessly scroll that I had to stifle. Most often, they do that via their apps on my smartphones. So, they don‚Äôt get space on my phone anymore. I access all the timelines on my computer. I follow the RSS feeds for many blogs to avoid visiting the timelines frequently.</p>
<h3 id="not-a-problem-for-all">Not a problem for all</h3>
<p>That said, I don‚Äôt judge others who continue to benefit from social media platforms. Get happiness out of using some or all of them. What‚Äôs hollow for me might be meaningful for them. This thought was one of the reasons I didn‚Äôt post when I quit social media for the first time. I wanted to avoid sounding preachy. Plus, the resolve to not use the platforms at all didn‚Äôt last for long anyway. I share the dilemma that Cheri puts down in <a href="https://hypertext.monster/2021/07/17/no-social-media.html">her brilliant essay</a> aptly named No Social Media Club.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My feelings are true to me, but I don‚Äôt want others to feel judged for what they choose to do. There was a time when our messier feelings were shared in certain contexts. At home. With family. With friends. With a therapist. Not online. Not like this. Not where someone who recently shared a donut photo might feel momentarily stung by my essay. You see my dilemma, no? What is currently truth for me might be a hurtful barb to someone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely. I am no one to judge other people‚Äôs choices. In response, they might judge me for such posts I write on my blog that I have no clue if anyone is reading at all. I have no likes or re-shares to show for them. I do this because I get clarity, happiness out of writing this, sharing this. As they say, you do you.</p>
<p>In short, in the strictest sense, I am not ‚Äúquitting‚Äù social media. It‚Äôs not the platforms in themselves that I have a problem with. Any interaction that leads me to consume meaninglessly, passively or makes me feel shit is what I am quitting.</p>

			 <p>‚ÄúDo what you love, and you‚Äôll never work a day in your life,‚Äù goes a mantra for success ‚Äì an adage that is unfortunately overrated, though. A person can‚Äôt always do what she loves to do. Rather, there are very few fortunate folks who do just what they want to do in their life. An extension to that adage is <em>love what you do</em>. Well, nor can one always love what she does. Rather, most folks hate what they do. They do it because they <em>have to</em> do it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPassion is the genesis of genius,‚Äù says Tony Robbins. Aha, that is precisely the reason we aren‚Äôt surrounded by geniuses. The majority of us are stuck doing something for which we have no passion.</p>
<p>That is such a cynical attitude, you say? Sure. But, it also is the reality of our world. Should we then give up? Far from that, actually. What one should do is to find out <em>why</em> they are doing what they are doing. For some, it might be the money. Or a sense of comfort. For many, it might be the best among the available options. Find peace with what you do. That is the first step to reach a phase in your life when you can do what you love to do.</p>
<p>There is also the fact that what you love can very well be temporary. It takes time to find your passion. What you think is your passion may very well be a fleeting interest. As Derek Sivers <a href="#">reminds us</a>, we can‚Äôt always depend on our current opinions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Our) former self is not always right. We shouldn‚Äôt preserve our first opinions as if they reflect our pure, untarnished, true nature. They‚Äôre often just the result of inexperience or a temporary phase. Old opinions shouldn‚Äôt define who we are in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the contentedness, though passing, that matters the most. Do what makes you feel contented, what gives you a good night‚Äôs sleep.</p>
<p>That said, there is, of course, another way. Stick to what you are passionate about. Switch paths when your passion changes. There will be hardships because doing what <em>you think</em> you love is not easy. But being satisfied never is. Be firm, stay strong.</p>
<p>So, which way do you prefer?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There‚Äôs no such thing as writing too much: your voice is important, your perspective is different, and you should put it out there.</p>

<p>This reminded me of <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2018/02/13/215000.html">a post I had written</a> that shared a similar sentiment ‚Äî we all can, and should, write. This particular passage that I had written, unfortunately, still holds true for many.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs saddening to see people resist the efforts to pen the words they think of. They go after what others have written, beautiful nevertheless, but at the cost of it being not real, fake. They underestimate the power of conveying one‚Äôs own feelings in whichever way possible. The words, their structure won‚Äôt matter much then. And that is one way one can start writing.</p>

A fixed schedule is better for me than thinking about whether to include as part of the newsletter every time I post a post with a title. Until there is a better control (via categories) on what posts I can schedule for delivery, I want to avoid risking this particular setting.</p>
<p>That said, I didn‚Äôt really like the way the first digest looked. It was‚Ä¶ mhmm ‚Ä¶ messy. Maybe a bit more control over the elements, like title etc. would be good. Without that, to make the digest look slightly better, here‚Äôs the custom CSS that I have added currently.</p>

</code></pre><p>I would like to avoid these <code>:nth-of-type</code> and <code>:first-child</code> blocks. But until the elements across the body are assigned classes, I will have to stay with this. Anyway, hope this helps. Or if there‚Äôs a better, simpler way to achieve this, I would love to hear.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Update [24 April 2022]</strong>: Fixed the issue with blockquotes being hidden due to the selection for headers being mistakenly applied to the blockquotes too. This uses the recently added CSS selectors for <code>.microblog_header</code> and <code>.microblog_footer</code>.</p>

			 <p>Today‚Äôs posts mark the completion of 30 days of daily posting on my blog. It wasn‚Äôt a planned challenge. But I wanted to attempt a routine, in public, of sorts. Prone to miss at least a day occasionally, a streak of any kind is always difficult for me. Plus, a good thing is that I didn‚Äôt have to schedule any posts just to make sure I don‚Äôt skip a day. I had written all the posts on the day they are visible on the blog. Well, in Indian Standard Time, that is. Even the long-form essays.</p>
<p>With post-a-day done, can I take up another 30-day challenge? I always wanted to post at least a picture every day. But, I am not too much into photography. Or rather, I am not good at it. Plus the worsening environment outside with Omicron in the air, it becomes a tad more difficult to find different places every day. What else?</p>

<p>Since my niece was born on this day three years ago today, the new year celebrations have been quite unfamiliar for us. The whole world celebrates along with us as she grows a year old, every year. Or so we have convinced her and her parents. This year is no different, albeit a tad muted. But still, the folks all-around plan to celebrate.</p>
<p>Knowing how all my plans for 2020 were mercilessly crushed by the pandemic, I had no expectations from 2021. I knew it was going to be more of the same dreadful cycle of panic, despair, and hope. At the same time, I also wished I and all my dear ones sail through, see the end of the year.</p>
<p>As I sit here today, looking at the year gone by, all I can do is smile. It began with a phase as dark as my family had ever seen. But it brought us all close, gave us the courage to stay strong. We got back on our feet, stronger. We learned to live with the virus, masked whenever outside. Vaccinating ourselves. Slowly, gradually, we wandered, unhesitant, outside our homes. Each one of us established our own new rules, routines, and traditions around travel.</p>
<p>We met our friends, got nostalgic for the days that we had left behind. We got hungry, got drunk and laughed our hearts out. I witness my office welcome my colleagues, the floors, and pantries reverberating with grumbles again.</p>
<p>I am fortunate I could do all of that. And a lot more. That I watch my crazy friends share their plans for celebrations with booze and snacks. That I would watch the skies light up with fireworks one more time. I am fortunate that I am about to get ready and join my family to celebrate my niece growing older by another year.</p>
<p>And if you are reading this, know that, in one way or the other, you are too. Just look back and find out why.</p>
<p>Resilience. And <em>kismet</em>. The two words I would remember 2021 by. Wish you a happy new year, you all!</p>

			 <p>It has been the third day in a row today that I decided to sleep early, get back to routine and failed. I just can‚Äôt stop myself from doing what I am doing at my system. Until last week, I used to lay down onto my bed with my Kindle and was sound sleep at the same time every time. That hasn‚Äôt been the case for this part few days.</p>
<p>I know what I need to do. I can‚Äôt make myself do it. Sure, I have my reasons why I am going late to bed. Nonetheless, I don‚Äôt like that a bit.</p>
<p>Sleep routine is a flaky thing ‚Äî disturb it ever so slightly, and it absolutely falls apart. And takes down the whole next day with it.</p>

			 <p>I decided against <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/12/29/an-inner-monologue.html">replacing my theme</a> with something entirely new. I have too many custom components baked in currently that <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/09/09/interesting-but-i.html">I don‚Äôt have time</a> to replicate afresh. Plus, all the feedback from folks helped me convince myself that what I have is good enough.</p>
<p>But, I have refreshed a few aspects in the existing theme. As advised by Khalid, I started with a typeface and replaced it with a serif one. It looks a lot bolder to me. A few clean-ups around accent colours. And a lot of moving stuff around.</p>
<p>What I have, thus, is something that looks different, yet is the same. The journey is incomplete yet, there are many ugly corners that need clean-up. But I will get to those as time permits.</p>

			 <p>An inner monologue around my site‚Äôs theme to follow. I have grown bored by looking at my current theme. Not that I don&rsquo;t like it, it just needs a reset. This has been how the site looks for a couple of years now. It looks so bland. Not playful. Not <em>personal</em>. There is no character.</p>
<p>Over the year, I have added so much stuff to the theme. It does not, at all, resemble what I started with. It feels hacky all around. I have realised I can‚Äôt create anything polished, so I prefer not to build something totally custom. I prefer anything that comes ready-made. But that‚Äôs tricky as these are still early days for theming with Micro.blog. I like a couple, but neither is perfect. Shall I start with one and personalise in limit? Do I want to take the project up?</p>
<p>I know, I know. ‚ÄúIt is the words that matter and not what‚Äôs around.‚Äù &amp; ‚ÄúMake the content beautiful, not the container‚Äù &amp; blah blah.</p>
<p>I get it. That‚Äôs the writer in me speaking. But <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/08/16/i-am-a.html">the developer in me</a> is craving for change. Can I hold him back?</p>

			 <p>I recently got nostalgic and got my daughter a new toy I played with as a child. As is her habit, she became curious and began asking questions on how it works. She did find out, and of course, decided to make a video of it. So, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiBnpuB2Pqs">a new video premiered today</a>.</p>

			 <p>I watched Incredibles 2 recently for the second time. I liked it a lot better on repeat viewing than <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2018/06/27/193700.html">I did the first time</a>. Perhaps I just had too many expectatios from the sequel to one of <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2020/06/21/231900.html">my favorite Pixar movies</a>. It&rsquo;s fun, kept me at the edge of my seat throughout. üé•</p>

			 <p>I love emails, sending and receiving them. In today‚Äôs world of social timelines where you shout into a void and expect an echo back, the medium of email feels a lot more personal. Drafting a long email to a friend today reminded me of the time when I wrote letters to my family, a few pages long. When we carefully selected and penned the words to convey the emotions we were living through. Physical letters were replaced by their digital form, the email, but the manner we communicated didn‚Äôt change.</p>
<p>With email, there‚Äôs no urgency, no pressure of read receipts and associated expectations for response. And when the response does arrive, there‚Äôs a feeling of connectedness. Instant messages, those words we spurt in burst, don‚Äôt exude that sense of affinity. A well-thought email does; it makes you mindful of the fact that someone cares.</p>
<p>One is a letter, another is messaging. It‚Äôs unfortunate that we have forgotten how to draft the former. I wish I knew more people who shared my liking for this medium.</p>

			 <p>Why is it so tiring to stay positive? Or to keep oneself motivated at times? It happens more so when I expect a lot in return from the time at hand. Why do I do that? <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/11/30/i-finished-reading.html">A reminder to self</a>. <em>Time is not something I have. Time is something I am.</em> Burdening it with unreasonable expectations is not fruitful. Anyway, there is no limit to our expectations from time.</p>
<p>If we manage to be productive for an hour, we still haven‚Äôt done enough as against what we would have in a couple of hours.</p>
<p>If we publish a post, we still haven‚Äôt participated in a social community we are part of. If we finish reading a book, we still haven‚Äôt read those newsletters or RSS feeds.</p>
<p>If we complete a task list at the office pending for weeks, we still haven‚Äôt spent enough time with our child. And the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>To everything that we do, there is always something we haven‚Äôt. Time is like a balancing scale. When balanced, more things are not on it than there are. To add anything to such a scale, we need to remove something first. The heavier the thing we put in, the more we extract.</p>
<p>We are balancing our time day in, day out. Acknowledging that we can‚Äôt do it all on a given day, we have to let a few things off our schedule for later. Why, then, ruin our days with something we didn‚Äôt do rather than celebrate it for something we did?</p>

			 <p>I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/12/10/after-a-welcome.html">recently cribbed</a> about how my smartphone was becoming the pesky little distractor again. I was planning to go back into a shell, keeping the device away from me for longer durations. However, I realised I may change the way and try being mindful this time.</p>
<p>I was hit by this thought during my guided meditation session today, when I came across this insightful observation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In trying to bend our will to that which is helpful, we strengthen our ego. In letting go of the things that are unhelpful, we free ourselves of our ego. Same intention. Different outcome.</p>
<p>We depend on our willpower to control our situation. We achieve the results but don‚Äôt train our minds. As a result, we harden our habits and behaviour. What if we change our approach. What if we acknowledge the unhealthy thought. But rather than becoming more rigid, we become softer. Rather than rejecting, resisting, we let go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting. I tend to depend on my willpower to not fall for the poor habits. That hasn‚Äôt worked well for me ‚Äî I avoid the habits for some time, but soon am back to natural poor state. My problems with my smartphone are an example of this behaviour. So, why not accept that my device is a bugger? Be mindful of the fact that my subconscious reaches out for the device frequently. And when it does, acknowledge it and let it go.</p>
<p>Be mindful of the attraction, but not be burdened by willing self into resistance. Remind self of the negative outcome and detach. Can I train my mind to not fall for the attraction but ignore it naturally?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One approach is rigid, based on will, based on control. Other approach is based on awareness. Recognising the thoughts that are helpful and engaging with them. Recognising the thoughts that are unhelpful and letting them go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no idea if this would work for me. Who do I trust more, my willpower or my ability to be mindful? I have seen my willpower falter. Maybe I should give mindfulness a try this time. That‚Äôs what I have decided to do.</p>

<p>Flicking through the channels on a TV set, I tried to rid my mind of all the homesick thoughts. Having checked in an hour ago in this plush Sydney hotel, I was sitting idle, feeling lonely. It was just a couple of years into my job, and this was my first visit to the country for an assignment. Though I was full of excitement for the new country, new city, my stomach was craving for some food now. Any food.</p>
<p>Excitement is for the unknown future. Even fear is for that unseen that lies ahead. Hunger is for real <em>in the present</em>, though. And I was fricking hungry.</p>
<p>It was an early Sunday evening, and it wasn‚Äôt time for dinner yet. But my body clock hadn‚Äôt adjusted itself to the timezone yet. It was lunchtime at my place home, and my body wanted food. Local time be damned.</p>
<p>Where I had checked in, they didn‚Äôt serve any food, either. <em>Weird</em>. The place wasn‚Äôt just a room but was a studio apartment with a bedroom and a compact kitchen in a corner of the living room. <em>Why call this a kitchen and not a living room with a stove?</em> My hunger was talking now.</p>
<p>Plus, there was nothing of interest for me on the television. It was playing terrible, poorly made advertisements and news shows where hosts chattered amongst themselves. Back home, I would find at least a dozen movies or sports channels by now. My first impression of Aussies‚Äô choice of entertainment wasn‚Äôt positive. <em>Why call this television and not just a list of numbers 1, 7, 9? That number song would be more fun than this.</em> My hunger was getting grumpy.</p>
<p>I scavenged for anything that resembled food in the kitchen, but all it had was empty utensils. I gave up. I wanted to go outside now, but I was petrified deep down.</p>
<p>It was 2009, a period with abounding reports of racially motivated crime against Indians in Australia. My family back home was already against my travel. But my excitement didn‚Äôt let me care then. Nevertheless, I was slightly worried now. <em>It‚Äôs a weekend evening in the big city, you moron. What can go wrong?</em> My hunger was absolutely pissed. I locked the room and stepped outside the hotel.</p>
<p>It had rained while I was driving from the Airport. The cover of clouds overhead made the evening appear darker than it was. For a Sunday evening, the wet street in the centre of Sydney was pretty deserted. Except for a couple of taxis plying along, there was hardly any person in the vicinity. There was a faint sound of the party music from a pub nearby. The crowd, though, wasn‚Äôt visible.</p>
<p>I stood uncertain at the entrance gate, unable to decide what to do next. I badly wanted to eat something, but I preferred not to walk onto a dozy street in this foreign land either. With my stomach grumbling again, I decided to take a walk around the corner to look for an eatery serving something.</p>
<p>With most of the shops closed, I took a turn towards what looked like a road going to a busy street. These were the pre-maps days ‚Äî iPhones hadn‚Äôt made smartphones everyday devices yet. You couldn‚Äôt type in ‚Äúfood‚Äù on your smartphone and toddle along to the place. I felt it would be better not to talk to any strangers ‚Äì there weren&rsquo;t many around me anyway.</p>
<p>The faint party noise I had heard earlier was getting closer. I paused again at the turn, contemplating whether to stroll further into the darkness. An unearthly yell decided for me. There was a jeep on the road ahead surrounded by five or six young boys chatting. Even in the dark, I could feel they were looking, laughing at me. I couldn‚Äôt see or hear them clearly, but I knew they were yelling something. And then someone from the group flicked a finger and laughed out loud again. <em>This can‚Äôt be happening</em>, a stunning fear overcame my hunger.</p>
<p>As I quickly started walking back to the hotel, I could still hear guffaws behind me. I have never dashed off a street, into the lift and back to my room so quickly. To this day, I don‚Äôt know whether the jeering was pointed at me. Was I just being unnecessarily paranoid? Had the news reports impacted my sense of judgement? I had no intention to find out.</p>
<p>In that fleeting moment of uncertain fear, the loneliness and alienness widened their hold over me. More than food, it was my homeland that I craved for now. I sat on the couch panting heavily, tears wailing down my cheeks. The darkness around me engulfed them. I wanted to talk to someone, but I had neither the courage nor the means to do that.</p>
<p>I did have my dinner that day once I gathered the courage to stumble onto the street again and go the other way. I found a small eatery serving Chinese food, and I had some food parcelled.</p>
<p>Back in the apartment and with cutlery <em>around</em> the stove in my hands, I gulped the blandest noodles I have ever tasted in my life. For my terrified mind and eyes crowded with tears, it was a scrumptious course of a meal.</p>

			 <p>I love Pringles <em>crisps</em>. But the way they stack up, I could never eat them in a bunch ‚Äî I feel guilty to eat more. As if I am emptying the can sooner and denying others of this wonderful cooked Potato. Fascinating how the container impacts your behaviour. Equally fascinating is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pringles#History">the history of this brand of snacks</a>. For example, the attempt was ‚Äúto develop a new kind of potato chips to address consumer complaints about broken, greasy, and stale chips, as well as air in the bags‚Äù.</p>
<p>Well, chips haven‚Äôt changed much. And they didn‚Äôt even want to ‚Äî as if they wanted to make the greasiness their identity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The product was originally known as Pringles Newfangled Potato Chips, but other snack manufacturers objected, saying Pringles failed to meet the definition of a potato &ldquo;chip&rdquo; since they were made from a potato-based dough rather than being sliced from potatoes like &ldquo;real&rdquo; potato chips.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the technicality aside (yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_paraboloid">the shape of the crisp</a> has a name), they just don‚Äôt taste like chips. They are different. And yet, ‚Äúno one can eat just one‚Äù.</p>

			 <p>After a welcome phase of independence from my smartphone, I am back to fidgeting unnecessarily with the device. I keep it close to me when I shouldn‚Äôt. Notifications have started pestering me again. They hack my focus away. I know the reason, I have given up on my resolve to not hand over the control. It didn‚Äôt happen instantaneously. It happened gradually, over time. Now I feel the burning sensation like a slowly boiling frog.</p>
<p>There was a time when I used to go to any extends to stay away from the device. Keep it in the next room. No apps. No notifications. <em>Never</em> next to the bed. YouTube disabled. And on and on. Eventually, every time I picked it, a bulb lighted in my brain reminding me to not surrender.</p>
<p>And the pesky device conquered those defences one by one, without me realising. It started with a few apps. Then their notifications. Then a need to watch and share a YouTube video from the device. Before I realised, I was wishing good night to my phone lying in the bed.</p>
<p>Today, I was on my computer, the powerful personal computer which can cater to all my commands. But I reached out, as if out of habit, to the smartphone just to peek at those apps, the web versions of which I had just visited. I knew I was sick again.</p>
<p>My smartphone has become the most personal thing I own, but also the one I need to frequently stay away the farthest from.</p>

			 <p>As much as I love Ghost as a blogging platform, I hate maintaining an additional platform. I needed to keep it on because it provided a wonderful way to deliver newsletters as an extension to a regular blog. Another reason I used it was the editor ‚Äî it is hands-down the best web editor interface out there. But, I never draft my newsletter posts directly in the web interface anymore. I use Ulysses for all forms of writing, and <em>I love it</em>.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/12/07/an-easy-upgrade.html">Micro.blog supporting the email newsletters</a>, I can <em>again</em> bring all my writing to a single place.

			 <p>Assuming Manton is <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/12/04/putting-the-final.html">about to announce</a> some way of emailing posts or digest of post to the subscribers of Micro.blog hosted blogs, here‚Äôs how I wish it works. Email is just another cross-posting option. I know it‚Äôs tricky, and it will not work that way given Micro.blog, as timeline, also supports feeds from external blogging hosts. But here‚Äôs how I hope it works for it to be useful for me.</p>
<p>The writer selects a category (or a group of categories) for emailing. The posts she publishes under those categories are emailed to the subscribers. Subscribers decide whether they want an email for every post or for a digest of the posts (on a defined schedule ‚Äî daily, weekly).</p>
<p>This would be a good start, everything else can come later. I have no idea if this is even a feature Manton is working on. But he says it‚Äôs ‚Äútotally unique‚Äù. So, I am hoping it works very different from typical newsletter services.</p>

			 <p>I am back to using Mach3 by Gillette. Having tried everything, this razor still gives me the most comfortable shave. I don‚Äôt love money-hungry tactics of Gillette, but am glad they made this model.</p>
<p>There was a time when I used single blade safety razors. When Gillette launched the dual-blade razors. I thought <em>it‚Äôs double the blades, this has to be better</em>. It wasn‚Äôt. Later, I could finally <em>afford</em> Mac3, and I used it for the longest period of time. There was no need to shift, it suited me.</p>
<p>Then the craze for Indie, hip brands with products targeting ‚Äúbros‚Äù engulfed India too. Search for a razor on Amazon and you will be bombarded with a slew of funnily named brands selling grooming products for mens. All claimed quality and affordability. Most targeted Gillette. Feeling burdened with guilt of not supporting newer brands, I switched. I started using a 5 blade razor from one such brand. And then kept hopping for a couple of years. Razor shopping soon became a hobby, and then slowly turned into a nightmare.</p>
<p>Eventually, I gave up and went back to Gillette. First to their pricey 5-blade razors and finally to Mach3. I realised something after this period. A razor with more blades doesn‚Äôt always mean better shave. <em>More doesn‚Äôt always mean better.</em></p>
<p>So in short, I am done feeling guilty for using a product from a brand that‚Äôs hated a lot. It works for me, so I use it.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54785515-four-thousand-weeks">Four Thousand Weeks</a>, a philosophical guide by Burkeman about time.

Doesn‚Äôt matter how much we try, we can never master time. It reminds you throughout the book that you don‚Äôt <em>have</em> time, but time is what you <em>are</em>.</p>
<p>Just like Burkeman did with his previous book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13721709-the-antidote">The Antidote</a>, he left with so many profound observations and thoughts.

			 <p>Every time the grinds of the daily life take toll over me, I travel to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabaleshwar">a place close by</a> with my family and friends. The last weekend was another such occasion.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I love this place not because it is a perfect family getaway (that it is), but because it is easy to travel to, and so there is not too much planning needed. Most trips get burdensome by the sheer pain of planning so much, so ahead of time. I enjoy the travels where that‚Äôs not the case, especially when I have no interest to be a typical tourist and go spot hunting.</p>
<p>The purpose of one‚Äôs visit is what matters at the end. If it is to find out everything of interest in a place, sure, go sign up for a hectic few days. Even I do that at times. But, why do that when irrespective of how much you roam around, you can never cover all the interesting places, anyway? The tourists flocking around an attraction kills it for me. It is just a place of business. I prefer the turn en route where no one halts. Or the point which hasn‚Äôt got any fancy name yet.</p>
<p>Anyway, I know every nook and corner of this resort I stayed in. My family and I have visited every spot of interest in the place, and so can selectively just visit those that <em>affect us</em>. We did just that this time, too. Maybe, I am different. I am glad that my family is just like me. Crazy different ‚Äútourists‚Äù that travel <em>for</em> the experience, not <em>with</em> a checklist!</p>
<p>Here are a couple of more pictures from the relaxing trip.</p>

			 <p>While on my morning walk today, I came across a kid who was cycling around our gated community. I see him every day, alone, free ‚Äî every time I see him, I know he‚Äôs enjoying his cycling. Today at a turn, I saw him sitting on the ground, his tumbled cycle next to him. I could see a lady with headphones and a couple busy with their chatters pass by him. The kid was staring down, scratching his knee, focused within.</p>
<p>I felt he wasn‚Äôt looking at anything particular, but rather was sad. Maybe he did look at a few people, with expectations, as they passed him by earlier, wishing someone to help him pick his cycle up. Maybe he had his expectations from humanity broken.</p>
<p>Anyway, as I came close to him, I asked him he was fine. All it took was my first word, and he was up on his feet, trying to pick his cycle. Once he gave me his permission to touch his cycle, I helped him get it up on its wheels. He adjusted his tiny spectacles over his nose with his wrist, mumbled a few words and paddled along. I soon saw him chasing pigeons with his cycle, the birds not flying away but hopping around. It looked as if the friends often played this game. In my opinion, his tumble today was a test that we adults failed.</p>
<p>What have we become as a Soceity that we prefer to remain plugged in to our digital worlds, that we don‚Äôt even acknowledge a saddened kid who simply needs a nudge to get back to enjoying the realities of life?</p>

			 <p><img src="https://static.amitgawande.com/images/2021/swimming-pool.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>On a scorching Sunday morning, an eight-year-old me is thrilled again to wear my new swimming gear. My parents have signed me up for swimming class, which I was habitually against at the beginning. I like water, but I don‚Äôt when I have to fight it. Almost a week since the classes started now, I enjoy this time.</p>
<p>I hear the muffled voices of my trainer, Mr Das, through my swim cap as I try to follow his instructions. He is showing us a group of children the effect of kicking the water to stay afloat. On the sixth day today, we are still holding on to the edge, flattening our bodies and just kicking the heck out of the water.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNot so hard, be gentle with those kicks,‚Äù I hear Mr Das shout. Most of us kids haven‚Äôt learnt how to be gentle with anything. We are having fun with water, splashing it as hard as we can.</p>
<p>I see my dad sitting outside the pool with the other parents. They are talking, laughing, being friendly strangers to each other. Bored with all the kicking now, I want to swim in the deep pool.</p>
<p>I am the typical obedient guy who doesn‚Äôt do anything he is told not to. But, today, I try. As I release my hold, hands still floating just above the edge, the kicking legs start pulling me backwards. I try to hold on, but my hands slip. I see I am floating away from the safety of something to hold on to. Panicked, I stop kicking and open my mouth to shout for help. I feel the chlorinated water in my nostrils and my throat. &ldquo;This is not working. I am going to die,&rdquo; I hear myself say. My eyes are watery. I know they are tears, but I am not sure if anyone else does.</p>
<p>And then suddenly, I feel a hand hold my body from below and carry me closer to the edge. Mr Das has handled many such curious kids over his career. He puts me closer to the edge and shouts, ‚Äúhold that edge tight and start kicking.‚Äù</p>
<p>I am safe, and I can breathe again. I look towards my dad. Oh, he is oblivious of all that I just went through. I still feel the taste and smell of chlorine. Feeling terrible, I kick harder than usual.</p>
<p>That is when the smell of chlorine hits me again, and things start to become hazy. I look towards my dad. He and his friends are still prattling. But I see an urgency in the staff around the swimming deck. In the pool, around me, all the kids are loosening their holds off the edges. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that,‚Äù I try to warn them. I don‚Äôt think they hear me. Even I do not hear myself. What is going on? I see myself float away from the edge now, water very close to my mouth and nostrils. I try to hold my breath, but I need to cough. I panic again. Angsty, I move every part of my body. My eyes search for Mr Das, I don‚Äôt see him around.</p>
<p>My movements slow down suddenly. The commotion around is dying. The voices getting fainter, my vision dreamier. I still feel there is water all around me. I am not feeling right. At this most unfortunate time, everything goes dark. No vision. No sound. An eerie silence. <em>I am dead</em>, I hear myself say.</p>
<p>But, I hear the faint voices again now. I try to open my eyes, the hazy chaos comes into focus. I am lying on a lawn, with strangers running helter-skelter. Other kids are lying around me, motionless. A lady I don‚Äôt know is trying to feed me glucose biscuits and milk. I feel it would be better not to put anything down my throat. I am already sick, my dad would know. But I can‚Äôt see him. I feel alone, naked. I try to shout for him, but my voice echoes within me. As the chaos around goes faint, I pass out again.</p>
<p>I wake up another time. We are in an ambulance this time. Now, I do see the face of my dad. He didn‚Äôt swim, but his eyes are still watery. With those pained yet resolute eyes, he is holding on to my hand tight. I don‚Äôt feel naked anymore. Amidst all the turmoil around, I pass out for the third time.</p>
<p>I open my eyes again, I am feeling light now. I find myself in the waiting area of a hospital. My dad is still around me. Though I am lying comfortably on a bench, he is holding my hand very tight. As if he doesn‚Äôt want me to get harmed by an impalpable danger. The kid in me doesn‚Äôt know it then, but I know now that he blames himself for the event when he feels he almost lost me.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go near a swimming pool ever, dad,‚Äù I say to him in a weakened voice.
He looks me in the eye, brushes my hair and responds, ‚ÄúI will never leave you alone, my son. Ever.‚Äù
The two are entirely differing feelings. But I know his promise will govern my life experiences, at least my teenage phase. I never climbed down into a swimming pool until I lived with my dad. He never sent me to any place where he could not be with me. For the better part of my youth, both held on to the resolves we took that day.</p>
<p>Eventually, I did learn to swim the way most of the folks in rural parts of India do. I kept jumping into the water bodies until one day, I had picked up how not to drown. For me, the water body was the swimming pool, and I learnt to stay afloat only as a young adult. But that eventful day of the chlorine leak birthed an overprotective dad, for whom the safety of his child became paramount.</p>

			 <p>I feel I have been struggling to find quiet time to read and write recently. I can blame it on many things, but I know within that I am to blame for this feeling. When I get time, I waste it. I convince myself that I need to relax first to get in the groove before I can write or read. I have been relaxing for a few weeks now, and it has only made me more tired.</p>
<p>This leaves me frustrated. Lazy consumption of other‚Äôs work is meaningless if it does not trigger any thought. I do that the most these days. I read, but I do not think. I write, but they are shallow thoughts. When do I spend time to churn a few ideas? To word them into something profound? You should write what feels right, I understand. But if it is only the deserts you chomp on, you won‚Äôt feel satiated after a point.</p>
<p>I need action, both to my mind and my body. Isn‚Äôt it curious that long phases of inactiveness can slowly wear them down? Both readily slide back to their lazy defaults. I need to be strong to push back and to make them move their asses.</p>
<p>Without that, what I have is a dull mind and a couch-clinging body.</p>

			 <p>Now that <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com/2021/11/19/113813.html?title=markdownInDrummer">Drummer supports Markdown</a>, I find it&rsquo;s a nice change overall. There are times when I invariably want the power of Markdown while writing some long posts. It&rsquo;s good that Drummer has that option now. I also like how Dave is implementing it &ndash; it&rsquo;s just a new node type. More I think about that, it feels very similar to WordPress' block-editor, but much better and simple. Even with this though, here&rsquo;s how I summarize my thought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not want to unnecessarily hamper the simplicity of posting with Drummer. That lack of complexity is this system&rsquo;s USP.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780446670111">Einstein&rsquo;s Dreams</a> by Alan Lightman today. This is a wonderful collection of thought experiments around our perception of time. The summary of the book says it&rsquo;s a collage of stories &ndash; but there aren&rsquo;t stories. With each &ldquo;story&rdquo;, the author <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8933.Alan_Lightman">Alan Lightman</a> instils a fascinating possibility for the concept of time being something uniquely different. What if everyone settles on their view of time? What if it is always in the past? Or always in the future? Or with just a day of life? It&rsquo;s a thought-provoking list.</p>
<p>All these 30 dreams are poetic vignettes that paint the varied interpretations of time. They evoke emotions through vivid narration of people&rsquo;s lives in such a world and their surroundings. I paused after each chapter, pondering over the impact existence of such realities could have.</p>
<p>At the surface, sure, these are just fictional stories. But dig deep, and you may be able to draw a parallel with realities of our world. With our perception of time. This is a beautifully written, short but profound read! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è üìö</p>

			 <p>I finished listening to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37786022-storyworthy">Storyworthy by Matthew Dicks</a> and I instantly wanted to purchase the eBook version of the book too. This is one of those few books that are best read as both audio and text version. The audio brings out Matthew‚Äôs expertise as a storyteller ‚Äî you realise how powerful the medium of storytelling is. However, <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com/2021/10/26/104336.html?title=audiobooksAndEbooks">as I had recently complained</a>, it doesn‚Äôt give me enough chance to make notes from. Or to go back to those key sections and read them again.</p>
<p>I am not a storyteller by profession. I don‚Äôt get on a stage to narrate a story from my life to a group of strangers. Rather, I can‚Äôt even do that if I wanted to ‚Äî the introvert in me shudders even thinking about it. But I do like to tell stories to the people I am comfortable with. To my family, my friends, my colleagues. And what Matthew attempts to narrate in this book is how to do that better.</p>
<p>But it‚Äôs not the ‚Äúhow to tell better stories‚Äù part that I found helpful. It is how to find those story-worthy moments from your life that had me excited. Matthew has a very natural, effortless way of conveying the methodical ways to identify, prepare and tell your stories easily. You would expect that, he is a teacher first, after all.</p>
<p>At the same time, he is also a writer and a renowned storyteller, though. So, listening to him tell his stories and use them as a tool to teach the process behind was fascinating. He has mastered the art over his many shows, and he lays out everything he has learnt through his experience for his readers to benefit from. He holds back nothing.</p>
<p>I have made so many notes, and I will make a many more when I <em>read</em> this book a second time. One thing, I have got homework for life now. And I don‚Äôt complain.</p>
<p>You should read this book even if, like me, you have no intention ever to tell your stories to strangers. Because, as Matthew says, there come moments in our life when we do tell our stories. So, instead of being terrible at it, we can attempt to do slightly better. Maybe we will not bore a few people the next time we ramble along in front of them. A must-read for me. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è</p>

			 <p>Apple is three things - hardware, software and services. Sooner they realize that services cannot follow the model of hardware and software, better it would be customers.

			 <p>Apple is three things - hardware, software and services. Sooner they realize that services cannot follow the model of hardware and software, better it would be customers. Platform lock-in for software (like iMessages) makes sense. Why they don&rsquo;t have a native app for Android for their services (like Apple TV+) is beyond me.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t remember the last book before <a href="https://sive.rs/h">How to Live</a> by Derek Sivers that made me contemplate so many times while reading. The moment I was done with the last page, I had my diary out to capture my understanding from each of the 27 answers to that one principal question, <em>how should I live</em>.</p>
<p>As Derek says in the subtitle of the book, they are all conflicting answers. But the conclusion is not weird at all ‚Äî for one, Derek is a masterful and a deep thinker. Each short chapter has most knowledge presented in the least number of words possible. Wisdom to words ratio is pretty high with this gem of a book.</p>
<p>At the surface, the book is pretty straightforward to read. Short chapters. Short, easy sentences. But, dig deep, and it is one of the most difficult books to fathom. It will force you to question what you have believed throughout your life, and it‚Äôs that questioning that will leave your mind unclouded.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs easy to write long, elaborate prose. But it takes time to shorten it, and I am glad Derek took that time. In his words, it took him four years, often writing 16 hours a day, to condense it down from the first draft of 1300 pages to 115.</p>
<p>What results is one of the most powerful and important books ever written. Take time and read it slowly. ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è</p>

One of the <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com/2021/10/21/163615.html?title=BenefitsofWritingwithDrummer">many reasons</a> for that is I can see all my posts in the same editing space. It is so easy to scroll through all your posts and find reference to just that one old post.</p>
<p>One thing that missing, though, was there was no easy way to get the <code>url</code> for that post right in Drummer. So, I got scripting.

			 <p>I recently <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/10/12/of-course-i.html">started blogging with Drummer</a>, a new Outliner made public by Dave Winer. It has been a wonderful experience. I don‚Äôt know what it is about a single outline as a base for your blog, but it feels natural. I have been enjoying writing and playing around with <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com">my Drummer blog</a>. However, it is not easy to fathom the simplicity of the whole system just through words ‚Äî only trying it out will make you appreciate the ease. I wanted to capture what it is and how to quickly get started with it for myself and others to follow.</p>
<p>Drummer documentation captures most of this information. But for someone, like me, who‚Äôs new to the concept of outliner, the whole stuff can be pretty overwhelming. So, here I capture what I learned and liked so that it helps other newbies like me.</p>
<h2 id="whats-an-outliner">What‚Äôs an Outliner?</h2>
<p>An outliner is basically an editor that can edit an outline. What is an outline, you ask? Well, outline is text items represented in a hierarchy, with each item having a parent (typically a title) or multiple sub-items (typically related points). There‚Äôs a lot more to know, but I am more focused on drawing a parallel with regular blogging terminologies.</p>
<p>You can think of a first parent item as a title of your post. Each sub-item that follows is like a new paragraph. You can further divide the items into sub-items, that‚Äôs grouping related points into a subtitle for example. The only difference is instead of it being represented as a header and list of paragraphs, it is a tree-structure of points, closely related and unrelated.</p>
<p>If a post doesn‚Äôt have any child, it‚Äôs a titleless post, a micro-post ‚Äî something like a tweet.</p>
<p>Dave Winer is the strongest proponent of using the outlines as the base for the blogs, he uses them for his blog, <a href="http://scripting.com">Scripting News</a>. The basic hierarchical structure of an outline, makes using outliner for blogging powerful. Both the types of posts, long-form and micro, sit well together. After all, it‚Äôs just one long list of text items one after another. Whether they have a sub-item or not define how they get represented. Or that‚Äôs how Dave likes them represented.</p>
<p>Drummer is one such outliner that benefits from the years of Dave‚Äôs experience. He has understood all the nitty-gritty of blogging through this form. So, once you overcome the initial struggle of unknown, the experience is pretty smooth.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-a-blogging-cms">Is it a Blogging CMS?</h2>
<p>Not really, Drummer is just a web application that can edit outlines. These outlines are typically represented as an <code>OPML</code> file. Basically, all you do with Drummer is edit <code>OPML</code> files of different forms. It wraps a few special <code>OPML</code> files ‚Äî mainly <code>blog.opml</code> ‚Äî to give them specific meaning while using them as base for blogging.</p>
<p>But, all we do is edit these <code>OPML</code> files then, what builds the blog?</p>
<p>Well, the software that runs Dave‚Äôs blog does that job. It is called <a href="https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog">Old School</a> (because Dave believes this is the old school way of blogging) and is hosted by Dave. In a way, Old School is the blogging CMS and not Drummer.</p>
<p>So, from my understanding, the way the thing connect is as below.</p>
<ol>
<li>You sign in with your Twitter account and that creates the necessary backend ‚Äî basically a S3 store for your OPML files ‚Äî based on your Twitter username.</li>
<li>You create, view, edit the <code>OPML</code> files using Drummer. The special files like <code>blog.opml</code> and <code>about.opml</code> hold special meaning for Old School. (<strong>Update:</strong> In fact, <code>about.opml</code> is just used for representation. You can name it anything.) So, you update them and through a command in Drummer (Build my blog), you communicate to Old School server to refresh your blog.</li>
<li>Old School receives the communication and based on provided inputs, it identifies the files to use for building the blog. It reads the <code>OPML</code> files from the backend store for the files and converts them to static files that get served as your blog.</li>
<li>Old School also serves you blog at the <code>http://oldschool.scripting.com/&lt;your-user-name&gt;</code> URL. So in a way, you don‚Äôt need to host any additional software.</li>
</ol>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="how-do-i-get-started">How do I get started?</h2>
<p>Dave has a got a handy documentation in place that you can follow. I will point to the relevant parts in the documentation so that you can follow along and get started.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Main blog:</strong> Follow the <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628692121000">getting started guide</a> to get a blog up and running with Drummer. In short, create a <code>blog.opml</code> outline file. Make the outline public. And finally, build the blog using <code>Tools &gt; Build my blog...</code>. This should open a new tab with your blog rendered with Old School. You can customise your title and description of your blog and a few head-level attributes.</li>
<li><strong>Title and Description:</strong> Modify/add the head-level attributes <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> and rebuild your blog.</li>
<li><strong>Header Image:</strong> Add a head-level attribute <code>urlHeaderImage</code> pointing to the header image of your choice and rebuild your blog.</li>
<li><strong>Copyright:</strong> Add a head-level attribute <code>copyright</code> with the text you want to appear in the footer and rebuild your blog.</li>
<li><strong>About Page:</strong> If you want to create a new tab in your blog for <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1633177951000">your About page</a>, create a new <code>about.opml</code> outline file using Drummer, make the outline public, add a head-level attribute <code>urlAboutOpml</code> pointing to this public outline and build your blog again. (<strong>Update:</strong> In fact, <code>about.opml</code> is just used for representation. You can name it anything, as long as you configure the value for <code>urlAboutOpml</code> accordingly.)</li>
<li><strong>Link Blog:</strong> If the concept of linkblog excites you, you <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1633177803000">can use another software</a> by Dave, <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a>. Just add a new head-level attribute <code>urlLinkblogJson</code> pointing to your linkblog JSON file, which would look something like <code>http://radio3.io/users/&lt;your-user-name&gt;/linkblog.json</code>.</li>
<li><strong>TimeZone:</strong> To make sure the dates are rendered correctly on your blog, add a head-level attribute <code>timeZoneOffset</code> for the place where you would be blogging from. The value should be the offset from UTC ‚Äî for example, <code>+5:30</code> for India or <code>-4</code> for New York.</li>
<li><strong>Creating Post:</strong> Head over to your <code>blog.opml</code> file in Drummer and click on the <strong>+</strong> icon (for New Note), write what you want to write and rebuild your blog. Your post should be up.</li>
<li><strong>Adding Links:</strong> Select the text to which you want to add a link, click on the ‚ÄúLink‚Äù icon (the second icon from top in the icon bar that sits on the left of the editing area) and insert the URL.</li>
<li><strong>Adding Images:</strong> This one‚Äôs slightly tricky. First, have your image hosted on some place where it would be accessible publicly. Get the URL to your image. While on the item you want to associate the image with, click on the ‚ÄúEdit attributes‚Äù icon (the third icon from top in the icon bar that sits on the left of the editing area). Now you can either create an inline image (with attribute <code>inlineImage</code>), right-margin image (with attribute <code>image</code>), title image (with attribute <code>metaImage</code>). I wish this work was simpler.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, you should have a well-configured blog up and running. Keep Drummer interface open in tab and keep adding entries. This method of updating your blog will soon grow on you.</p>
<h2 id="what-else-can-i-customise">What else can I customise?</h2>
<p>Even though you have all the basics covered till now, there is still a lot that you can and should do. But I would recommend get comfortable working Drummer and check for yourself if the workflow fits your routine and liking. If it doesn‚Äôt, these additional configurations are just a distraction.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you find out that you are enjoying this system of blogging, here are links to a few additional configurations that you can perform.</p>
<ul>
<li>Customise the styling using the custom templates <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628776805000">1</a>, <a href="http://ol.amitgawande.com/2021/10/13/170912.html?title=customTemplateWithDrummer">2</a></li>
<li>Build your blog <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628861390000">with one-click</a> using dedicated icon</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="a-few-additional-notes">A Few Additional Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li>There‚Äôs a Mac app (electron based) called <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml">Electric Drummer</a> that can act as an outliner. However, you should avoid using it for blogging if you intend to blog from multiple systems. Changes made through the app can overwrite ones as done on the web Drummer. So thread carefully.</li>
<li>Drummer is evolving. Dave is working hard to make sure all serious reported issues are resolved. Early adopters are trying out a hundred things independently. If that sounds fun, the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues">Drummer support issues page</a> is the place to go.</li>
<li>You can stay-to-date with all things Drummer by following <a href="http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/">this official blog</a>.</li>
<li>How does Drummer cost zero? <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/12.html#a114128">Dave answers</a>.</li>
<li>Why is Drummer, and other software from Dave, so tightly coupled with Twitter? <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/13/140500.html?title=whyWeUseTwitterIdentity">Dave answers</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>‚Äî</p>
<p>I intend to use Drummer as a place where I form my thoughts over the time. The ease of the updating process makes posting unformed thoughts a breeze. So, in a way, this space represents the most raw me. You can follow this me as he experiments with <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com">my Drummer blog</a>. And of course, there‚Äôs an <a href="http://ol.amitgawande.com/rss.xml">RSS feed</a>.</p>

			 <p><em>Don‚Äôt write for others, write for yourself.</em> Most long-time writers give this advice to someone who is just getting started. Actually, screw that. Every person who does any amount (and form) of writing gives this advice to every other person who wishes to do some form of writing.</p>
<p>Easy advice for others, but very difficult to follow oneself. To be frank, what does ‚Äúnot to write for others‚Äù even mean? Or write only for yourself?</p>
<p>I write when my mind blanks out. I write when my mind gets crowded. Most of the time, I write as I comment on something I read or listened to. At times, a thought makes me go, &ldquo;Hmm, that&rsquo;s curious. I should write more about it.&rdquo; Occasionally, I write because I want to force myself to write.</p>
<p>Writing something, anything, makes me focused. It calms me down. ‚ÄúI write because I have an innate need to write,‚Äù says Orhan Pamuk. More often than not, I share his sentiment.</p>
<p>But I am not perfect. I also write because I want others to read my writing. Trigger a conversation. Read what others think about my thoughts. As an introvert, that‚Äôs my only way to open up to others. I don‚Äôt care how many people read what I write. As long as I know that some do.</p>
<p>Numbers don‚Äôt matter to me. Conversations do.</p>
<p>On a philosophical level, everybody understands this belief of ‚Äúnot writing for others‚Äù. Write what your mind wants you to write, don‚Äôt write what others want you to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You write because your thoughts are important. You write because you are brave and willing to expose those thoughts. But, most importantly, you write because you have something to say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/live-your-life-on-purpose/why-do-we-write-89e56c069933">A fascinating perspective</a>. It is worded succinctly, but it still is philosophical. Everybody has something to say. But not everybody writes. So, what motivates you to put your thoughts in words?</p>

			 <p>Austin Mann‚Äôs reviews of iPhone cameras are absolutely brilliant each year. And this year‚Äôs <a href="https://austinmann.com/trek/iphone-13-pro-camera-review-tanzania">one for iPhone 13 Pro</a> is no different. All shots are gorgeous. Even the video shot completely on iPhone is stunning. These devices are smartphones, no longer. These are ‚Äúsmartcameras‚Äù.</p>

			 <p>After a two-weeks break away from all the timelines, it was good to scroll through a couple of them today.</p>
<p>The break also made me realise that I have made a few new friends online, especially from the wonderful community at Micro.blog. I missed the interactions with these folks. Each one of them is a brilliant creator in his or her own way. Bloggers. Photographers. Writers. They all are natural. They all inspire me.</p>
<p>I feel at home here, feel am part of this community. Not a feeling many platforms online can cultivate within you. It‚Äôs wonderful to be back and read through the lively discussions. The growth hasn‚Äôt dented the warmth, something that is pretty palpable here.</p>

<p>I love writing emails, I wish I knew more folks who enjoy my enthusiasm for emails. But my process of doing so is simple. I use the email client to draft the email. If I ever want to get it reviewed from someone else, I will just mail them with the draft or temporarily share the device.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs another reason why I don‚Äôt use any text editors for emails. Because if I do, I will start writing in Markdown and eventually hate my email client for not growing up.</p>

			 <p>Why‚Äôs the colour of everything marked unisex so bland? Who decided that mens don‚Äôt like any colours other than black or grey or silver? Or who decided that women will only like pink or purple? Why can‚Äôt I go on to a street carrying any non-black coloured umbrella and not get stares that judge me?</p>
<p>Some might say it‚Äôs trivial, yet I find this behaviour extremely frustrating. We claim we are making progress on multiple levels, yet we continue to stick our age-old presumptions of choices among sexes. And you know what, I have a theory why the choices of colours specifically are advertised in a way they are.</p>
<p>Professional places are bland ‚Äî colours aren‚Äôt professional. Life and playfulness is colourful. So, who do we see as a professional? Well, of course, men. And who‚Äôs all about play? Right? <em>Right?</em></p>
<p>Do you want to test this hypothesis? Here are Google Image searches for ‚Äú<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=man+with+umbrella">man with umbrella</a>‚Äù ‚Äî how many blacks do you see there? Now, here‚Äôs the results' page for ‚Äú<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=woman+with+umbrella">woman with umbrella</a>‚Äù. Same question, how many blacks do you see there? Plus, what other commonality do you see among the images that are on the page? What‚Äôs the look that men are flaunting? And what about women? The industry is infuriating. Sigh!</p>

			 <p>Why‚Äôs there a fascination among the devs to <em>reinvent</em> the old tech that isn‚Äôt broken? Maybe the reason that the tech has stayed the same isn‚Äôt because no one attempted to change it. Can you fathom the possibility that the tech might be fine, as it is, to most common folks? Or perhaps it might not be one of those things that most give a hoot about? Yeah?</p>
<p>The two prime examples I see many developers take a go at are browsers and email. Please, both work fine as they are. Don‚Äôt try to reinvent them. They have reached a state in which they are open and standard enough already. Most people know the functionality they can expect while using it.</p>
<p>Stop reinventing it. Improve it, no doubt. Make it faster, simpler. Cleaner. But don‚Äôt <em>change</em> the definition of what that tech represents. Don‚Äôt mar the traits that make the tech great in the first place, universal accessibility.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt attach a lot of muck around the fundamentals of the accepted tech and call it ‚Äú2.0‚Äù. I will suggest call it ‚Äú1.0‚Äù of whatever the heck you want to name it.</p>

			 <p>Kids are free, untouched by the necessities of the life. The concept of ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù doesn‚Äôt register itself with them.</p>
<p>For a kid, everything is necessary and, at the same time, nothing is. Is it necessary to eat? Sure, if he is hungry. Otherwise, it isn‚Äôt.</p>
<p>A kid does nothing because <em>it</em> is necessary to do it. He does it because <em>he</em> wants to do it.</p>
<p>In that sense, a kid always emphasises inwards, focuses on what is important to himself. As we grow, we forgot what matters. We emphasise what‚Äôs external.</p>
<p>The societal pressures. The fear of missing out. A kid knows none. <em>I like this</em> is all he cares about.</p>
<p>Listen to the kid in you, he sits closest to your heart. And if you can‚Äôt hear him, life‚Äôs going to a difficult journey, my friend. Be quick and wake up that kid within you.</p>

<p>I am certain it isn&rsquo;t for dummies neither does it claims to be so anywhere. It is for folks in a hurry, sure. I can&rsquo;t remember the last non-fiction book that read so easy for me. This feat is even more praiseworthy, given Neil deGrasse Tyson attempts to touch upon some of the most complicated and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->buzz-wordy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> topics from the past 13 billion of existence of this universe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them. In other words, after the laws of physics, everything else is opinion,&rdquo; says Tyson. I have rarely heard someone be so calm, yet extremely badass at the same time.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Seth Godin <a href="https://seths.blog/2021/08/the-inevitable-decline-of-fully-open-platforms/">talking about</a> how open platforms are always in risk of becoming spammy and losing the trust of the users. I entirely agree ‚Äî it‚Äôs a path that most platforms, open and closed, follow.</p>
<p>They enjoy the carefree attention from the excited early adopters who associate with the core values of the platform creators. But as the platform grows, it attracts users which would neither share the excitement nor the patience of the early adopters. They get noisy ‚Äî they want to use the platform like their old one they are comfortable with. They <em>need</em> features that they are used to, not what the platform provides.</p>
<p>So, eventually, the tension that Seth refers to above gains prominence.</p>

			 <p>It‚Äôs crazy how one‚Äôs mind works. Here are two posts separated by 4 years. I recently <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/08/16/i-am-a.html">published one a couple of weeks back</a>. I had <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2017/09/01/160500.html">published another in 2017</a>. Both the posts talk about a similar observation, about the constant fight between the coder and a writer in me. It reads in such a similar manner. The choice of words, the structure, the flow. It should be pretty apparent to anyone who reads it that both the posts come from the mind. From the same author.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, when I wrote the recent post, I had no clue that I had written about the same topic earlier some time. In a way, then, the adage that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no original work being written, but just rewrites‚Äù is not that far off.</p>

			 <p>Now that <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/08/31/googles-inability-to.html">I think about it</a>, the overall messaging space is a mess and personally it‚Äôs a frustrating issue for me. We are so close, yet so far. Here‚Äôs what I want.</p>
<ol>
<li>A service for messaging folks, share text and images</li>
<li>A service for voice/video calls</li>
<li>A service that does both 1 and 2 with apps across platforms - mainly iOS, Android and Web</li>
</ol>
<p>This will allow me to not worry about device on which I am using it.</p>
<p>iMessage and FaceTime combination is brilliant, but Apple continues to see them as differentiators for its ecosystem. I don‚Äôt blame them ‚Äî but it hurts me. I interact with only a handful of people that own an Apple device.</p>
<p>Google, well, decides to live in a fantasy world where there can exist no perfect messaging app. They get close to finding that right solution and throw it all away.</p>
<p>I had hopes from Microsoft. But for some reason they seem not to be interested in consumer space. Skype is ugly, its too bloated and the experience is terrible. It is not easy for families to join from.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, amidst all the mess, remains the only solution that does the required to any extend. It‚Äôs a terrible experience, but at least it works.</p>

			 <p>I came across <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/donelist">this suggestion from Oliver Burkeman</a> a few time in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if you worked on the basis that you began each day at zero balance, so that everything you accomplished ‚Äì every task you got done, every tiny thing you did to address the world&rsquo;s troubles, or the needs of your household ‚Äì put you ever further into the black?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, the idea is to keep a done list rather than a to-do list. I am absolutely certain that it benefits one&rsquo;s morale. I know that because I have been maintaining a form of done list &ndash; just that my method is different. For me, the two lists are complementary. I use a to-do list as a way to free my mind of the burden to remember things I need to do.</p>
<p>I do not set a target, an end date, for any of the tasks on the to-do list. So, they are not burdensome to me as my day begins. I look at the list, prioritize and just plan it through the day, if possible. A bullet journal helps me here - and also acts as a done-list. More the crosses on a page, more is the satisfaction.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading  <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781400064281">Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die</a> by Chip Heath. I wanted to love this book - the premise is brilliant. But it reads like a textbook, and that&rsquo;s no way to make a message stick with your readers. For that matter, that doesn&rsquo;t even look to be the author&rsquo;s intention.</p>
<p>To start with, the book lacks a clear, central idea that every chapter circles back to - it&rsquo;s all over the place. It digs into the history to find and describe every event, research or anecdote where a difficult message was conveyed effectively. Once it does that, the author summaries his understanding of why that worked.</p>
<p>First, the author nonchalantly tells you what the learning is &ndash; &ldquo;Which message do you think works best? Of course, second&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m sorry, but let the reader come to that conclusion. Don&rsquo;t beat him on the head till he gives up and agrees in frustration.</p>
<p>Second, each time the reasons that the message was effectively conveyed in each story are too varied &ndash; it references almost every phycological/managerial techniques - Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy and five whys and on &amp; on.</p>
<p>Finally, suggestions like be simple/concrete, don&rsquo;t bury the lead, capture attention etc are easier said that done. They are a set of skill that all understand they should have, but not every person has in equal doses. Please, your suggestion cannot be &ldquo;become a master public speaker or leader or designer&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These methods of archiving are either imperfect, impractical, or both‚Äîand besides, even if I went through with them, chances are that decades from now, I‚Äôd just end up with a monster text file or a long-obsolete hard drive that would be a pain to sync up with some future listening platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I lost my music collection some 7 years back and I never attempted to build a personal music library since then. I have accepted the fact that the benefits of streaming services (mainly around discovery) are more valuable to me than my quest for a personal collection of my favorite songs. Unfortunate, but practical.</p>

			 <p>I am wary of using any Apple services as my default - they make it very difficult to use them outside of their ecosystem. I do not use only Apple devices. There was a time when I did. And then things slowly changed.</p>
<p>I use Windows at work. I use Android and iOS. I use iPad. Apple services rarely work well across all the platforms. <em>Just access then on web</em> is not an answer am comfortable with.</p>
<p>So as much as I dislike it, I am slowly using more and more services from Google and Microsoft. Surprisingly, Microsoft does well to fill the void between Android and iOS platforms with apps that work well on both platforms backed by Microsoft services.</p>
<p>I find it crazy that neither Google nor Apple are keen to address this key problem.</p>

			 <p>OnePlus completely messed up my upgrade plans with its product launches this year.</p>
<p>I have been pleased with my OnePlus 7, it has worked brilliantly for the past two years. For that matter, the phone continues to work well for me. It hasn&rsquo;t slowed down. Battery still lasts me throughout the day. I just wish for better cameras now.</p>
<p>I had made my mind that my next phone was going to be the pro variant of next OnePlus. But somehow the company has managed to screw up its most valuable brand.</p>
<p>First, they priced the devices far too high this year. In itself, it&rsquo;s OK if you can match the offerings of the other flagship brands - mainly Apple and Samsung - beyond the device. OnePlus still has some work to do to reach that state.</p>
<p>Then, after unnecessary hype, they launched a product which has been <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/search/query?q=oneplus&amp;wm=false">marred by coverage</a> that they could very well have avoided. They mindlessly under-spec&rsquo;d the non-pro variant of the device. The pro variant is facing the outcome of overpromising and then deliver just on expected lines.</p>
<p>I could still decide to ignore the negative coverage and go ahead with the Pro variant. The reviews haven&rsquo;t been too bad, and I know what I can expect from a OnePlus device now. But I wish the company did not make the decision so difficult for me. I had just started warming up to the Android platform and its benefits.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time">Make Time: How to Focus on What Matters Every Day</a> today. I cannot apply all the suggestions that the authors have to offer. But it&rsquo;s a fascinating list of a few easy to follow tactics, presented in a no-nonsense manner. The authors stay to the point; they don&rsquo;t ramble along as many authors of the self-help books tend to do.</p>
<p>I did find a few of the suggestions pretty useful and have already incorporated a couple. I can clearly see the benefit. What helped is that the authors worked in an industry and in roles that I can closely associate with. So, I could relate to many of the problems they talked about and was keen to hear what changes worked for them.</p>
<p>If you are at a full-time job and are struggling to get the right balance between work and life, this book would have a few strategies that you might find useful. üìö</p>

			 <p>I have been reading many books from Christie recently. Every time I get into a reading lull, I pick up a Poirot mystery and start reading. I was facing one such lull and Dame Agatha was to the rescue again. Her books always help me get back to reading more.</p>
<p>Anyway, after I read another of her wonderfully crafted mysteries &ndash; <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215492.Lord_Edgware_Dies">Lord Edgware Dies</a> &ndash; I wondered why are these books not generally adapted to TV series and films. Most of her books are perfect. Yet, we hardly see any adaptations. Is it due to licensing?</p>
<p>Anyway, the one attempt I had seen recently was the disappointing <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/murder_on_the_orient_express_2017">Murder on the Orient Express</a> from 2017. It was unnecessarily stylized, the adaptations need to let the story take over. The complex simplicity is the most important virtue of the Christie&rsquo;s stories. Then there is the old, yet long-running, TV series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094525/">Poirot</a> &ndash; again, enjoyable in parts but tries too hard. That said, I have liked whatever I have managed to see (mostly on YouTube).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much scope for something in the middle, not too stylized and yet, a modern adaptation. Preferably in the form of a film or a TV mini-series. I did come across one such adaptation, the 2015 three episode television <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Then_There_Were_None_(TV_series)">mini-series of And Then There Were None</a>. IMDB Plus has made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nh56fQe-zk">all the episodes available on YouTube</a>. I enjoyed this particular form. I felt it worked.</p>
<p>So sad that there isn&rsquo;t much readily available.</p>

			 <p>This <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/621654/what-speed-shall-i-go-to-make-my-day-longer">discussion on Stack Exchange</a> proves again that the majority, including me, understands so little of the relativity theory. Easy to think it&rsquo;s easy. It ain&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>So at what speed I should travel to make my 24 hours day equals 36 hours?</p>

			 <p>It was a couple of years ago when I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2019/03/25/213000.html">had ranted</a> about how the alternatives to the popular social networks are not seriously considered. A discussion something on these lines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What all alternatives have you tried? Were there none that were good? If so, why? What is missing? How can they be made better? What is it that you are looking for in a social network?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s so frustrating to see the state hardly change. A call to <em>tell the makers of the service why you cannot use their service</em> is rarely answered. Sure, new social networks are launched, but they have the same underlying problems. They create unnecessary flutter and eventually die down. Why not create buzz for something that&rsquo;s not aiming simply for the acquisition?</p>

			 <p>My daughter has been reading short storybooks since she was 5. She likes to read &ndash; she would find a comfortable corner for herself and start reading her books. I was a bit cautious introducing her to a full-length novel, though. I didn&rsquo;t want to dampen her interest in reading by the usual wordiness of the novels.</p>
<p>But recently, she asked me for some big books &ndash; &ldquo;I am bored with these small stories,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<em>I know them by heart now.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, I did give her a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27558257-magic-of-the-lost-temple">couple of</a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6310.Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory">&ldquo;big&rdquo; books</a> last week, and she hardly goes anywhere without her book since then. She carries a pencil and an eraser, underlines words she doesn&rsquo;t understand well, bookmarks pages. Ah, I&rsquo;m so happy to see her so engrossed while reading. I wish I had started reading sooner; I&rsquo;m delighted to see my daughter has.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Oh, recently I have seen another habit of hers. She likes to copy small stories into her notebook, then read them in her handwriting and out loud in her voice. Yay!</p>
<p>I wish she keeps her interest in reading intact as she grows and would assist her in whichever way possible. To start with though, I need to choose the right books.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16366.Endless_Night">Endless Night by Agatha Christie</a> and am not at all impressed. This review might contain spoilers, but I can&rsquo;t help I have to rant.</p>
<p>Nah, I am not letting the ending influence the overall rating for the book again. It is easy to get wowed by the intelligent ending and rate this book highly. But it wasn&rsquo;t a good read for me.</p>
<p>Right from the start, I didn&rsquo;t trust the narrator. I guess I&rsquo;ve been fooled by many first-person narrations for my liking. Michael is a poor narrator - not sure if it was intentional on Christie&rsquo;s part. None of his actions, his reactions made sense to me, further heightening my suspicions about what I was being told by him. So the twist towards the end fell flat - it was as if I already knew deep down and was just waiting for it to be revealed.</p>
<p>Oh, and I was waiting a lot of time throughout the book. 2/3rds in and there is hardly anything that takes place. To me, the love story between Mike and Ellie was not interesting. The way it played out was dull. It got tiring at one point to read Mike <em>tell</em> what was happening. The suspense around Gipsy&rsquo;s Acre wasn&rsquo;t built at all. It was supposed to be a &ldquo;gothic story with gypsy&rsquo;s warnings&rdquo; - wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>This may have been a brilliant psychological thriller for its time. But a lot has happened since 1967 and too many have been inspired by the style of surpriseful narration from this mystery master for this style to create the necessary impression anymore. This read was so unlike any other from Agatha Christie and this time it is not in positive sense.</p>

<p>This one had a pretty interesting storyline with lots of twists and red herring peppered across the chapters. Having said that, I wish the writing in the middle third was a lot more crisp. It gets too simplistic, slips into a narrative style of <em>telling</em> what&rsquo;s playing out. I would have lost the patience, but it was the rapid pacing of the plot that kept me going. Also it has a few subplots and characters that should have been edited out - it becomes tiresome to follow towards the end.</p>
<p>With all said, this is a promising debut nonetheless by Raman with a welcome, quick read with an Indian setting.</p>

			 <p>I was fascinated to learn about the so called town under one roof - Whittier. It has to be one of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/heres-what-its-like-to-visit-whittier-alaska-the-town-under-one-roof/slidelist/51542206.cms">the most isolated places</a> <em>which people call home</em>. I have so many questions about how the residents of this town <em>make</em> this place a home, how the isolation, the sameness affects them. It mustn&rsquo;t be easy.</p>
<p>I was mesmerized by this how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLnEHiIMohM">Michael Stevens describes</a> what the town must represent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The earth around Whittier is not always a friendly place. But so long as people call it home, Whittier stands as a magnificent gesture of defiance. Of human engineering. And the strength of inertia, of our desire to stay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more I think about it, maybe the life of us city dwellers is no less isolated than the residents of Whittier. Sure, they are stuck in one same building, surrounded on all sides by rocks. But so are we - if not physically, mentally we have caged ourselves.</p>

			 <p>All forms of art have potential to capture even intricate aspects of our world. A still photo can capture a moment, a memory, an emotion. <a href="https://www.nyip.edu/photo-articles/photography-tutorials/three-techniques-for-capturing-motion-in-photography">Even motion</a>. So can music. A painting. Or a movie.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I respect artists. Because they can capture the essence of our life.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve got a few minor (?) feature requests for Micro.blog hosting based on my limited experience with the service. I think these features will further heighten and simplify the experience.</p>
<ol>
<li>I wish the edit buttons were available on the posts in the timeline, for example, right next to the remove option.  The availability of the remove option makes me believe the context is already available. Also, I understand an option to edit the original posts from blogs not hosted by Micro.blog might be tricky, but I hope Manton finds some simple solution, as he usually does.</li>
<li>I believe the edit for the replies is far simpler in comparison and should really avoid all the hoops one has to go through today, just for minor fixes.</li>
<li>Just the way, the whole site can be archived to GitHub automatically, I wish the custom theme can be too. It would help to track all the changes being made to the site design. Without the option, I need to manually set up and check-in the changes to the repository. And given how easy it is to update the custom theme from the browser, it just feels natural to allow backing up the theme as a git repository.</li>
<li>Currently, the spell checks and Grammarly plugin does not work in the post drafting <code>textarea</code>. I am not yet sure why, but it makes the posts very prone to errors.</li>
<li>This is way down the list (literally), but I wish the drafts are auto-saved while composing longer posts. I do not want to lose a draft just because I closed a window by mistake.</li>
</ol>
<p>Possibly these items are already on Manton&rsquo;s backlog list but just aren&rsquo;t prioritized. In which case, here&rsquo;s an added vote for these features.</p>

			 <p>One would think with the lull outside, with hardly anything to do outside, it would be easier to concentrate on work or a hobby. But we human beings have mastered the art of not staying bored, rather surround ourselves with more distraction than we can handle. Only us.</p>

			 <p>With the way IPL has played out this year, I&rsquo;m sure the mood in many teams room is a tad dreary. Many performances picked up late causing reshuffle of the points table towards the later half. Though only Mumbai Indians have been consistent, I hope we get a new champion.</p>

			 <p>I came across this <a href="https://www.baty.net/2017/wordpress-is-a-typewriter/">opinion from Jack Baty</a> about static sites and I completely agree with him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[P]ublishing a static site is like sending a document to a printer. I have to make sure everything is connected, that there‚Äôs paper in the machine, and then wait for the job to finish before seeing the output. If something needs editing, and something always needs editing, the whole process starts over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a time when I enjoyed building my site with Hugo, but I never got comfortable with the writing flow then. Once I got tired and moved away, I&rsquo;d made up my mind that I won&rsquo;t ever sign up for a static site for my blog again. I firmly believe that blogs aren&rsquo;t the right candidates for static site generators.</p>
<p>Blogging platforms need to be light, free - something that static site generators, with the way they are setup, can never be. Jack&rsquo;s got just the right metaphor to express my thoughts. Writing <em>does</em> feel like priting a document with static sites.</p>

			 <p>I really enjoyed Aaron Sorkin&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_trial_of_the_chicago_7">The Trial of the Chicago 7</a> - it was an absorbing account of an event I didn&rsquo;t have much information about. I usually like the well-made courtroom dramas and this one was no different. And I also usually <em>love</em> Sorkin&rsquo;s method of telling stories and, again, this one was no different.</p>
<p>Though debatable, Sorkin is a master of narrating true stories, keeping you glued to the screen as he unravels more details about the story. He has also mastered his signature style to blend varying and often opposing, narratives and perspectives without letting the drama drag any moment. Even though I didn&rsquo;t know much about the event, I was completely involved and moved at many moments.</p>
<p>Also, as I was watching the trial play out, I thought Sorkin must have taken a lot of liberty in presenting the facts &ndash; especially the actions of Judge Hoffman. <em>No human can be such an asshole</em>, I thought. So the first thing I did was to check how closely were the event and the trial presented. I was surprised to find that most of <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2020/10/trial-chicago-seven-aaron-sorkin-accuracy-netflix.html">the key moments shown were true</a> &ndash; even the judge&rsquo;s behaviour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As unbelievable as it seems, Judge Hoffman, born in 1895, really did act with the malice shown in the film, dismissing objections from the defense before they were made and arbitrarily excluding evidence, witnesses, and even jurors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Horrible!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The lady on the microphone announced in her squeaky voice, &ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Mumbai airport.&rdquo; Oas groaned, closed his eyes, and contorted his face like only an exasperated 75-year-old can. Having heard her numerous times in the last couple of hours, he was tired of listening to her any more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she think I&rsquo;ve never been to an airport before?&rdquo; he muttered under his breath. &ldquo;Bah. I&rsquo;ve been on planes for longer than she&rsquo;s been on earth!&rdquo; The staff was running helter-skelter on the airport with some angst that Oas couldn&rsquo;t fathom. &ldquo;<em>Freaks</em>,&rdquo; he sighed in disappointment.</p>
<p>The constant low hum of the music from the headphones of the young guy beside Oas didn&rsquo;t help his mood either. As the guy shuffled in his seat, the huge laptop on his lap brushed against Oas&rsquo;s arm again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want my lap too?&rdquo; Oas blurted out loudly as he knew the guy couldn&rsquo;t hear him. &ldquo;Take it, I am happy to help you save the world which is what I assume you must be doing,&rdquo; he continued muttering. The guy hardly budged.</p>
<p>Bored of the one-way conversation, Oas got up and stood gawking at the hustle-bustle around. He was a lost alien amidst the time-poor professionals. He walked to a television screen in the lounge playing CNN. A news scroll read about a novel disease spreading through China. The main news being run on the channel though was about a kid at the Mumbai airport traveling alone. Oas massaged his forehead in disdain, wondered why this was news, and walked away.</p>
<p>He began to stroll around the airport. He had to buy nothing, but he also dearly wanted to interact with another human being. He wandered through the Crosswords bookstore, hoping a salesperson would ask him if he needed any help. No one did. Lacking the patience to browse around the towering walls of disparate books, he walked straight to the bestseller section. He glanced at all the self-help books crowding the non-fiction racks. The fiction ones were full of tales from fantasy
worlds. Oas was fond of neither; so he strolled out.¬†</p>
<p>He saw a deserted coffee stall. Hoping that the person selling coffee would be as bored as he was, Oas walked to him. The person was seated on a low stool chair; to Oas&rsquo;s disappointment, even he was lost in his smartphone&rsquo;s screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s hot?&rdquo; Oas asked the guy with a wish it would trigger some small talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We only sell coffee here,&rdquo; responded the guy without glancing away from the glowing screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you serve it hot?&rdquo; Oas quipped.</p>
<p>The guy hadn&rsquo;t looked at Oas yet; he didn&rsquo;t even now. He jerked his face towards the coffee vending machine and said, &ldquo;We serve it however this machine dispenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With all his hopes for even a meaningless interaction crushed, Oas ordered a cup. The guy shrugged in annoyance, got up and walked to the machine. He served the coffee with eyes as dull as sloth&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Sorry to put you through so much trouble, my friend,&rdquo; mocked Oas. The sarcasm in his voice was lost on the mindless guy. He responded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a bitter taste in his mouth, Oas walked back to the gate buzzing now with the regular pre-boarding bustle. A lot of people had gotten up in the anticipation that the queuing would start soon. &ldquo;<em>Would they prefer to stand up longer just to be ahead in the boarding queue?&quot;</em> Oas wondered. <em>&ldquo;Just so that they could sit inside the plane longer?&quot;</em> The rationality behind the thought had always stumped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Puri?&rdquo; Oas heard a soft voice calling for him. He turned to face a flight attendant, smiling a very plastic smile at him.¬† The nametag on her read &lsquo;Anjali&rsquo;. Oas stopped himself from telling her that she had unnecessarily puffed her face with makeup. She had helped Oas earlier at the check-in counter; he had stopped himself even then.¬†</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you please follow me?&rdquo; It sounded more like a command to Oas than a request.</p>
<p>He looked at her, puzzled. He couldn&rsquo;t think of any reason why he should follow her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok, Anjali,&rdquo; he said curtly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need any help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, we have a priority boarding policy for all the senior citizens,&rdquo; she spoke without letting her two pepper-red lips touch one another for long. &ldquo;We will get you on the plane first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oas stared at her like a child would at his examiner. <em>&ldquo;Why does the world make us elders feel a lot more helpless than we are?&quot;</em> He didn&rsquo;t have much choice though; the stewardess looked adamant.¬†</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine. But I would need to be taken care of. I don&rsquo;t want to get stuffed in and forgotten,&rdquo; instructed Oas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t happen, sir.&rdquo; The plastic smile didn&rsquo;t leave Anjali&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Oas followed her. He was stuffed into the plane. And forgotten.</p>
<hr>
<p>Oas looked at the kid from the CNN news report boarding along with Anjali. He wished the kid wasn&rsquo;t sitting anywhere close to him. Sure, Oas was yearning for interaction with another human being, but he was convinced that kids didn&rsquo;t fit that category. He did not hate them. He just believed they were dispatched by God to make people live through misery right on earth for the sins they have committed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kids are too clumsy,&rdquo; he used to tell his wife, Sara, &ldquo;and too stupid to spend any time with. All they can do is leave you more frustrated than you were before.&rdquo; Sara, on the other hand, believed they were godsent to spread joy amongst the grieving souls, to teach them valuable lessons about life. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why God sent us no child. We are not grieving, you see.&rdquo; She used to joke with tears soon shimmering in her eyes. Oas let her settle with her fantasy.</p>
<p>Oas saw the kid follow Anjali till they reached right next to where he was seated. She started pushing the kid&rsquo;s backpack inside the overhead compartment. Oas dropped his face in his palm; the kid saw him do that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avik, this is your seat, right next to nice Mr Puri here,&rdquo; introduced Anjali. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you would enjoy your flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oas saw the kid slide onto the seat next to him and blurt, &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Avik shuffled into his seat by the aisle. He looked towards the open overhead compartment. Then he stuck his neck out into the empty aisle. He wanted to see someone around; he didn&rsquo;t. Displeasure cloaked his innocent face. He then looked at Oas who had picked up a magazine and was clearly pretending to be engrossed in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you reading, Mr Puri?&rdquo; Avik was looking curiously at Oas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that will interest you,&rdquo; Oas answered curtly without looking at him once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you like reading Mr Puri,&rdquo; continued Avik. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look too interested in that book. My mum says if you enjoy doing something, you are always very busy doing it. So much that you won&rsquo;t even answer a question from someone else.&rdquo; Avik had pulled out the envelope kept in the seatback pocket and rummaged through what was inside. &ldquo;I never answer my mum when I am watching cartoons, you know, because I looooveee cartoons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Avik was doing nothing to thwart Oas&rsquo;s beliefs about kids, rather, he was only making them firmer. &ldquo;Why are you alone, kid? Why are you not with your mum?&rdquo; Oas asked while putting the magazine back into the envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in Bangalore. My father is also in Bangalore,&rdquo; said Avik while pulling out the printed safety instruction manual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are <em>you</em> not with your mum?&rdquo; Oas asked again, thinking, &ldquo;of course <em>kids never answer the question that&rsquo;s asked&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they are not in Mumbai?&rdquo; Avik shook his head a couple of times and continued staring at the pictures in the security manual. &ldquo;I was living with my grandma here. She is very old &ndash;&rdquo; Avik paused and looked at Oas&rsquo;s face again. &ldquo;Not as old as you, though. But she still says she can&rsquo;t fly; she says she is afraid.&rdquo; Avik wasn&rsquo;t accustomed to staying silent. &ldquo;I am not afraid at all. My mum says I am very strong.&rdquo; Oas himself had started rummaging through the envelope now, searching for
headphones that he could plug his ears with. &ldquo;She says I am stronger than all my friends in the school. Rohit, Sid, everyone. Neil does beat me sometimes, but I always hit him back. My mum says I am stronger than even my father. My father -&rdquo; Oas had found the headphones and had quickly plugged his ears shut. He looked at Avik; he could see his lips
move, but heard no sound at all. He breathed a sigh of relief. He was happy that he had booked a first-class ticket; at least they provided the customers noise-cancelling headphones.</p>
<p>Oas saw Anjali standing by the gate welcoming the other passengers that were boarding the flight now. He watched a couple enter the flight with a baby. The father was walking in front carrying all the luggage. The new-mom was struggling to carry the baby through the narrow aisle without letting even its sock touch anybody around. <em>&ldquo;That kid&rsquo;s going to wail throughout the flight now.&quot;</em> Oas let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>The guy with the huge laptop under his arm and headphones over his head walked in next. Oas smirked looking at him. &ldquo;The Avenger,&rdquo; he muttered and chuckled at his joke.</p>
<p>Oas felt a pat on his arm; Avik was gesturing at him to remove his headphones. Oas didn&rsquo;t want to, but Avik had shifted his attention to work the seat belt that was holding him in his place. Worried the kid would set himself free, he pulled them away and gave Avik a probing look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what I was saying, Mr Puri?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t. You see &hellip;&rdquo; Oas pointed at his headphones. &ldquo;&hellip; I was listening to music. Now that is something I like doing, kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you keep calling me &lsquo;kid&rsquo;? Everyone else calls me &lsquo;Avik&rsquo;. My mum says she spent many days thinking before she settled on that name. You know what it means?&rdquo; Without waiting for Oas to speak a word, he bent his arms, flexing his biceps. &ldquo;It means brave, just who I am, my mum says. But she always cries when she says that, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last statement made Oas freeze in his place. He saw a moving image flash in front of his eyes; of Sara hunched down next to Oas, laughing and crying at the same time. <em>&ldquo;Oh, I know you are brave, Oas!&quot;</em> He could recall Sara lying to him, preparing him for something he just wasn&rsquo;t ready for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does she cry?&rdquo; He asked Avik in a much softer voice suddenly.</p>
<p>Avik shrugged, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He continued his assault on the seat belt.</p>
<p>Oas continued to stare at the kid, gloomy thoughts clouding his mind. Feeling increasingly restless, he asked, &ldquo;Are you going back to your mum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m. Grandma says my mum&rsquo;s missing me. She always misses me.&rdquo; Avik had given up on his fight with the seat belt. &ldquo;Who are you going back to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one. I am going back to being alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone? Do you like living alone? Don&rsquo;t you have a family? My mum says everyone has one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The innocence in the kid&rsquo;s voice caught Oas off guard. &ldquo;I had, once. I don&rsquo;t now since my wife. . . uhmmm. . . you know - &quot; Oas wasn&rsquo;t sure if the kid was old enough to understand the concept of death. This was one more reason he didn&rsquo;t like spending time with kids. &ldquo;<em>They could keep making the mindless fart jokes around you, but say &lsquo;shit&rsquo; around a kid and the whole world starts judging you,&quot;</em> he always complained. Sara was good at manoeuvring such situations; Oas wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Did your wife die?&rdquo;¬†</p>
<p>Oas was taken aback by this unexpected straightforwardness. He gulped the heaviness of the moment down his throat and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she did love you, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Oas nodded again. &ldquo;So, why are you alone then? She must be still around, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oas looked at the kid expressionless. His mind was full of questions that he knew he would get no answers for from this unripe mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mum says the people that love you do not go anywhere even if they die. They do disappear but continue to stay around. They never leave you.&rdquo; He was busy unfolding and folding the tray table over his lap now. &ldquo;My mum says she also is never going to leave me alone. I don&rsquo;t know why she keeps saying that; I know she won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone around had settled down into their seats now. A calmness spread through the plane that Oas didn&rsquo;t share. Uneasy, he stared out the window into the darkness outside, illuminated by the occasional flash of lightning. Within, he was storming through the dreary thoughts.</p>
<p>Anjali was now ready with the security demonstrations. She was used to being ignored, but the kid craned his neck to take in every word she said. Oas, on the other hand, was lost in his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uhhh &hellip; Why do they rush through these security instructions? Do they even want people to understand them?&rdquo; Oas looked at him struggling with the seat belt again. He finally got it open and squeaked an enthusiastic &ldquo;yay&rdquo;.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Cabin crew, prepare for take-off please.&quot;</em> Oas heard the Captain announce. Avik was jumping up and down on his seat; he didn&rsquo;t look alone any more. Oas unbuckled his seat belt, stretched towards the kid and put him back tied to his seat belt. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you unbuckle the seat belt now. Your mum won&rsquo;t want you to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Avik settled back into his seat. Oas locked his stare at the darkness outside. The flight took off, passing through the stormy clouds. The raindrops pattered against the window and then stopped suddenly as the plane cut through the low dark clouds.</p>
<p>Avik had unknowingly slid his hand around Oas&rsquo;s arm. Oas smiled at Avik. &ldquo;Your mum&rsquo;s right. You <em>are</em> a brave child.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>My quest for simplicity <a href="https://amitgawande.com/2020/10/28/i-have-always.html">wins me over</a> again. Simple is always better. It&rsquo;s a lot less friction prone.</p>

			 <p>I have always<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> wondered when is it that I write the most? What makes me active at writing? Or when is it that I stop (<a href="https://tales.micro.blog/2020/10/27/just-a-test.html">or pause</a>) writing? Is the ease of putting the words out? Or is it the clarity of thoughts inside? I spend a lot of time on what&rsquo;s outside, the immaterial material stuff. Rarely, do I spend time to peek inwards.</p>
<p>May be, just <em>maybe</em>, it&rsquo;s not the CMS. Or the the blogging engine. It is the storm within that&rsquo;s causing me to halt.</p>

			 <p>I wonder if I would be ok to post mainly from mobile, but as a regular micropub post. WordPress always allowed me to post so much more. I am not sure what m.b allows. It should be good enough, but is it really? That would be a test.</p>

			 <p>I have been writing a lot less recently - I wish I knew why. I think the prime reason for that is the <a href="https://amitgawande.com/slacking-at-hometown/">recent</a> change in routine.
