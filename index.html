			 <p>I read this in the Firefox&rsquo;s latest release notes&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The :has() selector is now supported. This allows authors to match an element that has, or &ldquo;anchors&rdquo;, at least one element matching its relative selector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip; and first thought I had was isn&rsquo;t it curious Mozilla calls people who will use this feature &ldquo;authors&rdquo; and not &ldquo;developers&rdquo;?</p>

			 <p>One app for feeds and newsletters is a promise that&rsquo;s hardly fulfilled, especially when newsletters these days are HTML-heavy &ndash; almost webpages. No feedreader renders the majority of them. It can work only when a separate view is built just for newsletters and I don&rsquo;t know of any that does this well. I have tried Feedbin, Reader and a few others. They all suck.</p>

			 <p>Every time I see a blogging platform make title a mandatory field, I cringe. I know why the new blogging platforms generally do that — it simplifies the UI and backend design. But that tells me they will support the titleless posts only as an afterthought, which I don’t like. </p>
<p>Start with titleless posts as the base, making them first-class citizens. Stitch the design around that. And then add support for titles. People latched on to the microblogging phenomenon of Twitter and Facebook because they made posting interfaces frictionless. A simple textbox floated at the top of the timeline for quick thoughts to be posted.</p>
<p>That’s what every blogging platform needs if we are to attract more people to blogging. Everything other than the content of the post is meaningless.</p>

			 <p>After deliberating over whether to offer membership for my online creations, I decided to set up a <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/amitgawande">single One a Month tier</a>. The decision to set up a membership of any form was triggered by the recent realisation that led me to pull down Scribe- the realisation that my side projects cost me dear. Every month, the prices add up, and I eventually run out of motivation to keep going.</p>
<p>However, the step to keep it simple and affordable for people considering support is inspired by a <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/@/page/FzQB8gwtyZXZ2yq3">recent post by Manu</a> where he proposed changing the defaults on pricing the support.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 1$ part means you can set it up and forget about it because it&rsquo;s a low enough amount that won&rsquo;t make too much of a difference for the majority of people who are considering supporting online creators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a period now, I have had a Buy Me a Coffee page so that others can support my hobby projects. Many have, and I could not be more grateful. I have now rolled out a simple membership to cover the projects that <strong>need hosting and, hence, carry a monthly bill</strong>. The likes of Scribe. And Micro.threads.</p>
<p>With one membership, there are no complicated tiers. And no special rewards, either. Frankly, I could limit the number of members to ten as that&rsquo;s all I need to support my ongoing side projects. But I am keeping things simple for now.</p>
<p>However, in today&rsquo;s tumultuous world, one full of uncertainty, to expect anything in return <em>for my hobby projects</em> would be unfair on my part. No obligation, hence, on anyone whatsoever.</p>

			 <p>I really <em>really</em> wish I could use Phanpy for scrolling through my Micro.blog timeline. It is a well-designed interface for a timeline of any sort. The fact that the <a href="https://github.com/cheeaun/phanpy/">source code is open</a> is very tempting. But I stop myself every time from signing up for a new project.</p>

			 <p>The recent discussions around social media platforms tire me. BlueSky. Threads. Mastodon. And whatnot. They are all the same. Trying to cash in on the lost interest in Twitter. To be similar to Twitter, yet distinct at the same time. I see people try these different services and get impressed. Their interest fades away after pounding the timelines with posts. This has happened to me with all the above services.</p>
<p>The network effect that Twitter managed 15 years back won&rsquo;t be recreated. Twitter was a lone service. Fifteen years ago was a different time.</p>
<p>When I joined Twitter, I cared zilch about how I should use it. Or <em>how I shouldn&rsquo;t</em>. That was a different me then. Now, I think a lot about how and how much I should use social networks.</p>
<p>I hold myself back out of fear. Fear of uncertainty. Fear of complexity. Fear of promises.</p>
<p>The fear won&rsquo;t let me get hooked to any social networks anymore. Syndicating posts from my blog is not going to do that either.</p>

			 <p>I had forgotten that I had purchased iA Writer and had the app installed on my Mac. So odd that I missed this. Anyway, with <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2023/12/09/i-am-planning.html">my plan to shut down Scribe</a>, I am back to writing with iA Writer.</p>
<p>I believe Ulysses' overall better experience, both writing and publishing, attracted me to the app. I subconsciously moved away from iA Writer, never to return. Time to change that. iA Writer was the first writing app that I fell in love with. It&rsquo;s no surprise, then, that it continues to impress.</p>

			 <p>We had so much fun watching <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wonka">Wonka</a> today. Loved the music and the colourful narration. The story, though predictable, was delightful, too.

			 <p>I have always disliked the apps that provide you with a 15-minute summary of the books, usually non-fiction books. Such services are reviewed well and people seem to be paying for them. For example, <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/">Blinkist</a>. Here&rsquo;s whom this service claims to be built for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for curious people who love to learn, busy people who don’t have time to read, and even people who aren’t into reading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get this. What&rsquo;s the fun in listening to a 15-minute summary of books? Even podcasts, they claim?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to not be into reading books. One isn&rsquo;t really missing anything if they don&rsquo;t read books &ndash; the information will find its way to reach them. Why, then, the farce of reading books through summaries?</p>
<p>With the rise of ChatGPT and likes, services now don&rsquo;t even want people to read articles on the web. For example, <a href="https://resources.arc.net/en/articles/8399405-arc-max">the latest update for Arc browser</a> launched a new feature called 5-second preview where one can &ldquo;<em>press Shift and hover over any link to generate a summary of the webpage, without a single click</em>&rdquo;. This is not good as it can potentially kill people&rsquo;s (already dwindling) interest in visiting other websites.</p>
<p>Why are we so against any form of reading in the original voice?</p>

			 <p>When I created <a href="https://scribe.amitg.net/">Scribe</a>, the idea was to make it work fully client-side &ndash; everything works from my browser. I intended to keep myself in check, to build only the simple, must-have features. It is good that I took that decision; otherwise, I would go down a rabbit hole supporting everything I want to. A lot is missing currently, I know. I have also heard a lot that others suggested.</p>
<p>But to be frank, I don&rsquo;t know where to start. I can&rsquo;t support many of the requests without a server-side component &ndash; for example, handling images. What&rsquo;s that one feature that is the most glaring miss? I have been using the editor for over a week without issue, other than a few styling fixes.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I am open to feature requests (and even pull requests) though. So, if there&rsquo;s a feature you want to see supported, do <a href="https://github.com/am1t/scribe/issues/new">create a new issue</a>.</p>

			 <p>Even though it is a holiday today, I decided to trudge outside the home. Alone, and unplanned. Just with a backpack, my laptop and my phone. For many, this might be very common. But it&rsquo;s not for me. I usually idle around at home. I might read or watch something. On rare moments, write too. But I would never leave the home unplanned.</p>
<p>Sure, I do very commonly go outside with my family. Or friends. But it usually is a planned trip to a mall, a restaurant or a resort. For dining, hanging out or just relaxing. But I rarely do any of those alone &ndash; <em>the me time</em>.</p>
<p>There was a time when I could get such time right at home. I could box myself in the study room and cut every distraction out. Be alone, get bored. That&rsquo;s the best way I know to focus on everything that I love to do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get the needed focus at home anymore. There&rsquo;s calm, and I spend quality family time. But I do that without any self-goal as such. The minutes and hours go by. Yet, I hardly get anything done that matters. Something that makes me feel good within.</p>
<p>You know that feeling when you are happy, yet something feels missing?</p>
<p>I realized this recently when I was away with my family on a weekend stay at a wellness resort. It was a much-needed break away from the hustle and bustle. I decided to carry nothing with me. No books. No iPad. No diary. I locked my phone in a drawer the moment we reached. My daughter, the extrovert she is, quickly found few friends and got busy playing. My wife had planned a few therapies and was away for a few hours. So, even though we went together as a family, there was a period when I was alone with nothing to do and no one to talk to.</p>
<p>And I absolutely loved every second of it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It reminded me of when this boredom was very common for me. I suddenly craved such a period of loneliness and the ideas that left me with. So, it was time to correct a few things at home.</p>
<p>My wife had recognized this uneasiness in me. Don&rsquo;t the soulmates usually do? She had been suggesting many things to pull me out of the lull. <em>Why don&rsquo;t you go out alone? Why don&rsquo;t you meet your friends? Why don&rsquo;t you go down and walk?</em></p>
<p>I ignored all those suggestions. Aren&rsquo;t we always told to spend as much time as possible with family? So, I always wanted to stay around the people I love the most.</p>
<p>But in doing that, I alienated the one person I should never have. <em>Myself</em>.</p>
<p>Today, I corrected it, and I intend to make it more common. Allow me to get bored through lack of anything to do. Or of anyone to talk to. So that I can listen to my mind and do what it wants me to do the most.</p>
<p>If these 500 words are anything to go by, I might feel at peace with my mind again.</p>

			 <p>I have been working on an editor for Micro.blog that has a simple interface and works well even for long-form writing. I have written this post from what I call <a href="https://scribe.amitg.net/">Scribe</a>, a clean web-based editor that can post to Micro.blog.</p>
<p>This is a focused writing space with an editor that <em>completely works on the client side</em>. What I write is auto-saved locally. I can save the same to Micro.blog as a draft to be edited later there. Or I can post it to go live on my blog. There is a word/character counter and dark mode. And it also works on mobile.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not the first post I have published with Scribe &ndash; I have been using this for the past couple of days, fixing all the issues, big and small. Now, you can also try it out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing else to explain. Just get writing and sign in to Micro.blog, if you like it.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t read a more frustrating book than <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53139064-the-eighth-detective">The Eighth Detective</a> by Alex Pavesi. It has a smart premise. Pavesi was aiming to attempt something pretty unique. But then I feel he got distracted by the lure of surprising readers. The twists and turns were too many to keep the book coherent. There are no characters to connect with. No story that captures your attention. The seven stories narrated by the lead character are silly. The twists are sillier. And are one too many. It was frustrating to see a clever premise wasted through controlled writing.</p>
<p>At the same time, I haven&rsquo;t heard many better narration performances than by Emilia Fox. She is extremely natural while voice acting in both stories and dialogues. I could visualize every character distinctly just through her voice.</p>
<p>The last time I was this impressed by someone&rsquo;s narration was when I listened to <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/04/17/i-cant-remember.html">Ray Porter narrate Project Hail Mary</a>. Absolutely fantastic!</p>

			 <p>Threads reminded me of why I eventually fell off the Twitter timeline. It&rsquo;s the same people talking about the same stuff they always do. The early adopters, the famous bloggers, and podcasters. The social media celebrities. They have a bubble of their own. They talk amongst themselves as you listen. You are not part of any community &ndash; you are watching a show.</p>
<p>Then there are the posts that are written mainly to go viral. The memes. The questions. The jokes. And the jokers. The social media diarrhoea.</p>
<p>These threads (pun unintended) garner the most engagement, which makes the algorithmic timeline bubble them to the top. Now, these are all I see. And I don&rsquo;t enjoy either of them.</p>
<p>The diversity of both the posts and the people is also why I love the timeline on Micro.blog. It&rsquo;s never the same people or the same type of posts that crowd the place. And if they do, I know how to correct that.</p>

			 <p>Recently, I have seen many people get nostalgic about Google Reader. The argument is that if Google Reader hadn&rsquo;t died, the internet wouldn&rsquo;t have been in the dire state it is today. As if the demise of Google Reader caused the rise of proprietary timelines of Twitter and Facebook. Unfortunately, it was the other way around.</p>
<p>Plus, Google Reader was a flawed, terribly designed, niche product only used by a handful of tech-savvy people. I say this even though I was a big fan of the product. It could never have survived in the form it was in.</p>
<p>Sure, web browsing does feel horrible today, as Tim Sweeney of Epic <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1674860397617111059">tweeted</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The internet feels increasingly broken. News sites are paywalled or account walled, Reddit is nag walled, Google search spams ads and SEO to the point of uselessness, and now Twitter is account walled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with all of it. But I don&rsquo;t think Google Reader could have addressed any of it. RSS, for sure, cannot. It&rsquo;s just a standard to simplify consumption. The problem lies at the source.</p>

			 <p>While working on <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2023/04/21/a-blog-no.html">my blog&rsquo;s recent redesign</a>, I decided not to display the date/time as part of the post. Sure, I am not the only one who does that.</p>
<p>Although debatable, I find that detail useless for my type of writing, and I was ridding the interface of every element that wasn&rsquo;t essential. I don&rsquo;t write posts which are relevant only to a particular period. I am not writing news articles that will go stale. Plus, if there&rsquo;s an article that forms the context for a post, I explicitly link to that.</p>
<p>So why does it matter when the words are written? I stand by and am even proud of every post I have written. Short or long. On the contrary, I don&rsquo;t want the age of the post to impact what it says. It&rsquo;s still me saying that. Just younger. It is the same reason I <a href="https://amitg.blog/what-do-i-call-the-entries-that-i-write-here">don&rsquo;t correct</a> my old posts.</p>
<p>I have also seen people put a disclaimer on old posts saying it may not reflect one&rsquo;s current views. Colin <a href="https://colinwalker.blog/blog/?date=2023-03-19#p1">puts such a disclaimer</a> on his older posts and writes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just because I may not think a certain way, however, doesn&rsquo;t mean that I can&rsquo;t be proud of what I have previously written — some of it is among my best writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with Colin. But for the same reason, I don&rsquo;t want to put any such disclaimer. Isn&rsquo;t it obvious that one&rsquo;s perspective towards things changes over time? Why call it out, then?</p>
<p>I accept that not showing the date is extreme. After all, I still include the date in the source and RSS feeds. But removing a detail is the best way to determine if it is essential. And currently, I am all for a reset.</p>

			 <p>A few months back, I responded to Om Malik&rsquo;s thoughts on the importance of stream of posts on one&rsquo;s blog. Here&rsquo;s what <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2023/01/31/does-the-stream.html">I proposed</a> we bloggers should do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recommend stuff to the reader on our platform, our blogs. On our home pages. And around our posts. But instead of letting AI decide, let&rsquo;s curate these recommendations manually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have since wanted to update my website, my primary home on the web, to do away with the standard design principle for a blog. Why does every home page have to look a certain way? Pages after pages of reverse chronological lists of posts.</p>
<p>I recently quipped that blogs have made the web boring. That every blog looks the same. All themes are more or less the same. A slight layout change here. A margin or padding there. Varied columns. But all look the same to me. You know that you are reading a blog.</p>
<p>I wanted to stop doing that. I want to curate the experience for the readers. Worst case, for the one reader that&rsquo;s me. So, I have been working on laying out the structure for this space afresh<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A home page recommends a selection of posts. No page&rsquo;s a reverse chronological list. Even if a reader visits one that&rsquo;s supposed to be, for example, <a href="https://amitgawande.com/archive">archive</a>, they won&rsquo;t see a list. Every page allows a search and an option to visit a random post. A prominent nav bar allows navigation around every post. There are a lot of other minor touches sprinkled across.</p>
<p>Plus <em>there are colours</em>. Minimal doesn&rsquo;t mean black and white. Minimal can have personality. It does now.</p>
<p>Satisfied after playing around and iterating with the changes for a couple of days, I applied the layout to the site today. Once I did, I wondered if this space was a typical blog any more. As per Wikipedia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A blog is an informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not a diary. No reverse chronological order. And yet I don&rsquo;t care. To me, a blog is what a blogger wants it to be. And I am done with the stream of posts. So here&rsquo;s to a bold new start.</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I do maintain and actively publish at a traditional blog and the nav bar points to that. Irony much?&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

Given the list of artists as part of the cast and crew, I had such high expectations. But the skill of being a competent storyteller cannot be faked. It tried too hard to be cool, &ldquo;new age&rdquo;. Every frame screamed that it was inspired by the style of Guy Ritchie or Tarantino. Or even Bharadwaj&rsquo;s own Kaminey.</p>
<p>What the Jr. forgot is it isn&rsquo;t the style that made these directors what they are.</p>
<p>Everybody was trying too hard &ndash; even the seasoned actors looked uncomfortable playing the part. A short run-time of 90 minutes felt too long, even though the screenplay was fast-paced. I kept moving ahead scene after scene because I knew exactly how it would play out.</p>
<p>Barring the last 15 minutes, hardly any part catches your attention. Sigh! Such sheer waste of talent.</p>

			 <p>I attempted to watch Netflix&rsquo;s new docuseries &ldquo;MH370: The Plane That Disappeared&rdquo; - and it&rsquo;s absolutely terrible. It gives focus to too many characters, goes all over the places and never returns back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s the story they want to tell. It&rsquo;s not what happened to the plane or who is responsible or even how it affected the people related to the passengers on-board. It tries to do all of it and does half-assed job at each.</p>

			 <p>I have stopped using YouTube on my phone for quite some time now. Even my iPad and laptop, I use it very carefully. I do not like what it has become, especially the home page. Google&rsquo;s aggressive recommendations and creator&rsquo;s ability to game it have made it home to clickbaity and idiotic content.</p>
<p>Google wants to make YouTube addictive, and I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2019/12/26/070000.html">want to fight back</a>. Here&rsquo;s the way that worked for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I either access the video directly (if I know what I want to watch) or browse my Subscriptions page (when I don’t know what to watch). The home page is useless without history turned on. And so are other recommendations. Trust me; you do not want them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, Google has managed to ruin the subscriptions screen too.</p>
<p>As if the recommendations for sensational videos weren&rsquo;t bad, Google found another way to spike engagement or our addiction to the app - shorts. I have been vocal about <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/07/15/as-far-as.html">my dislike</a> for this form of content.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that Google seems to be aggressively pushing it on creators, making it more profitable in some manner. Now my subscription page is full of short videos, with no way to filter them out.</p>
<p>The high-quality videos are getting lost in this drivel of mindless shorts, even from the creators I respect. I do not know how some of the most intelligent minds are ok with this. I have seen this play out to written words &ndash; the long-form essays are lost amidst the hot takes and rants on social timelines.</p>
<p>Google has done the same to the last sane space on the platform. I can now simply get rid of my usage of this platform altogether.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Google, and thank you!</p>

			 <p>I thoroughly enjoyed <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt24516518/">Vaalvi</a>, a Marathi dark comedy thriller. I don&rsquo;t remember the last time I laughed out this loud while the characters in the movie handled one serious situation after another. I wasn&rsquo;t laughing at the idiocy of the film or the characters; rather, <em>the movie wanted me to laugh</em>. Therein lies the brilliance of this film.</p>
<p>Is it perfect? Absolutely not. But it&rsquo;s an intelligent film. Sure, it has moments where it leans towards absurdity. But if you recognise the tight budget for Marathi movies and ignore such rare moments, you can enjoy even the absurdity thoroughly.</p>
<p>I wish this movie was more readily available. Do watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm0s7r3kRKw">the trailer</a> &ndash; I am sure you will enjoy it.</p>

			 <p>I watched all four episodes of <a href="https://www.netflix.com/in/title/81617079">The Romantics</a> today. I loved the first two that documented the early life of Yash Chopra and the Yash Raj Films. I especially enjoyed the references to the early 90&rsquo;s movies &ndash; especially the music. That was also my biggest gripe with the docuseries &ndash; it just didn&rsquo;t speak enough about Yash Chopra&rsquo;s taste in music. And <em>his love for lyrics</em>.</p>
<p>I remember listening once to Javed Akhtar on how valuable the lyrics, the words, and the poetry was to Yash Chopra. &ldquo;If music is the body of a song, lyrics are its soul,&rdquo; Javed Akhtar had said. Yash Chopra understood that.</p>
<p>So as I got nostalgic while listening to all the songs from the yesteryears &ndash; Waqt, Kabhi Kabhi, Silsila, Chandni, Darr  &ndash; play in the background, I wished the makers of The Romantics had spent a whole episode just on his appreciation and quest for good music. There are so few Indian directors left who still value music as a core identity of movies. Yash Chopra was one of them.</p>

			 <p>The weekly report from Digital Wellbeing on my phone informs me that the daily average screen time was 20 minutes less than last week&rsquo;s. And I am pleased to see that trend has been downwards for the last few weeks. I uninstalled YouTube from my phone a few weeks back, which is one of the key reasons for lowered usage.</p>
<p>YouTube sucks away time without you noticing. The best way I know to control this beast is to not be available to you. The web app is a pain enough to not be distracting. So just get rid of the app from the phone and get your time back.</p>

And also been a blogger since updating one&rsquo;s blog, and visiting others to look for inspiration was a multiple-times-a-day activity. It still matters for all of us who have consumed the stream of blog posts. Or at least we understand it.</p>
<p>I generally follow blogs through RSS, where a stream is meaningless. But I would still follow a linked post to a new blogger that I don&rsquo;t know about. I then browse through the stream of posts to see if the blogger&rsquo;s topic and writing interest me. If it does, I subscribe to his RSS. So the stream is important for me for discoverability.</p>
<p>But the people who haven&rsquo;t ever consumed such a stream of blog posts may not find it helpful. The algorithm has spoilt us with the &ldquo;recommendations&rdquo; &ndash; the links to the other stuff on the platform.</p>
<p>So we as bloggers should serve the same. Recommend stuff to the reader on <em>our platform, our blogs</em>. On our home pages. And around our posts. But instead of letting AI decide, let&rsquo;s curate these recommendations manually. We have all the tools that we need. Tags/Categories. Let&rsquo;s add a few layers if required.</p>
<p>I have already started doing this with my blog. I have modified my home page to take readers to specific sections of the blog. I have separated posts prominently. I want to introduce a few more sections on blog and around posts. This is all still a work in progress, though.</p>
<p>Another tangential thought. We have stripped our blogs of all the fun in our quest to get minimal. Do you remember the tag/word clouds? Posts by date? By category? Or most commented? Let&rsquo;s bring them all back. We had more than one way of presenting our blogs to the readers. Why did we stop that?</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780307463746">Rework</a> by Jason Fried today 📚</p>
<p>I loved the simple, usually apparent suggestions. Most go against the proven and often advised business best practices. I love the bold ideas and the no-nonsense way the suggestions are delivered through simple short chapters. But, I am afraid I will not be able to benefit from most of them. Jason targets folks like him who are in positions of decision-making regarding how their businesses are run. Not many are in that position. So, as much as I would love my organization to follow even a few of Jason&rsquo;s suggestions, I am afraid I cannot influence that.</p>
<p>That said, though, I will keep the book close so that I refer back to the clarity of thinking that Jason has lived his business career with. I hope it comes in handy someday.</p>

			 <p>My family and I watched <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/strange_world_2022">Strange World</a> yesterday. I don&rsquo;t remember when I was this unimpressed with a Disney movie. The makers attempted to hit a lot of big ideas but forgot what story they wanted to tell. The world-building is half-baked and foolish. The emotional parts bore you. The climax is dull.</p>
<p>My wife quipped, &ldquo;Disney doesn&rsquo;t know how to make a movie with a male protagonist.&rdquo; After all, when did Disney last make a movie with a strong father-son dynamic? Maybe Nemo?</p>
<p>This comment from <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/strange-world-review-disneys-audacious-new-animated-film.html">Alison Willmore&rsquo;s review</a> of the movie resonated with me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So much of Strange World’s audaciousness is front-loaded into its concept, and so little of it comes through in the execution. Its themes linger in the mind longer than any line or emotional beat in part because those elements feel so rote and secondary.</p>

			 <p>Every time I find a book enjoyable to listen to, the number of steps I walk increases. Or the time I do house chores for. I love putting the headphones on and listening to the story progress. My current listen, <a href="https://www.audible.in/pd/B07HB4ZXTT?source_code=ASSORAP0511160007">The House of Silk by Anthony Horowitz</a>, narrated by Derek Jacobi, is one such book. With a good intriguing plot and wonderfully involved narration, I am having so much fun listening.</p>
<p>As a result, I am walking a lot more and keeping my home absolutely clean. A welcome side-effect.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781781251485">The Obstacle is the Way: The Ancient Art of Turning Adversity to Advantage</a> by Holiday Ryan today 📚</p>
<p>Laced with real-life examples and a corresponding lesson in each chapter, Ryan Holiday presents valuable insight into handling obstacles. Nicely structured in three sensible parts &ndash; perception, action and will &ndash; this is a good, practical guide to staying balanced without getting bogged down by roadblocks and failures in life. Ryan doesn&rsquo;t want to make this a guide for stoic philosophy. Instead, he sprinkles the best of the lessons throughout the book. That helps keep things simple, which most books on Stoicism fail to do.</p>
<p>As he mentions towards the end, many people he tells the tale of &ldquo;embodied the best practices of Stoicism without even knowing it&rdquo;. Ryan recommends that just doing matters more. For his intention to not complicate the philosophy, he deserves credit.</p>

And I can&rsquo;t wait. Yay!</p>

			 <p>My aversion for the concept of timezone is not hidden - I probably have an yearly post begrudgingly accepting the fallout of this weird phenomenon.</p>
<p>What makes it worse though is how each region is allowed to select their own timezones. This makes the situation messier than anything to do with time should be. Just search YouTube for weird timezones. There are ample examples of how we have screwed this up.</p>
<p>I read about another such <a href="https://www.howderfamily.com/blog/australias-weird-little-time-zone/">weird little timezone from Australia</a> - given the size and nature of the region involved, this has to be amongst the craziest.</p>

<p>I hope to live my life in the same manner, in portrait mode. Put things that matter to me in focus. Blur the sidelines into the background. It might be messy around me. It always is. But to let it impact my perspective towards the moment or not is my choice.</p>
<p>So a friendly reminder for myself - put what matters in focus. Make the ugliness that surrounds me the blurred background. It may only heighten the charm of the moment.</p>

<p>After a long time, I am finally happy with how my <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/post/">long-form articles</a> and <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/notes/">short-form notes</a> sit distinctly together. The setup took time and some <em>crazy personalization</em>, but I had to shake a few things just for the sake of it. I had started taking my blogging too seriously, and I didn&rsquo;t like that. I work better when it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>The only downside is that it is an entirely custom and personalized theme. And for now, I am okay with that. Plus, it&rsquo;s still a work in progress.</p>

			 <p>Every service wants to be everyone&rsquo;s favourite. But what the makers are working towards is being favoured. Or popular. There is a minute but significant distinction between those two.</p>
<p>It is easy to market something subjective, which is what the latter is. &ldquo;Best&hellip;&rdquo;. &ldquo;Most liked&hellip;&rdquo;. &ldquo;Hottest&hellip;&rdquo;. How often do we hear those words in advertisements? The former, on the other hand, is binary. Objective. You are either someone&rsquo;s favourite, or you are not. More often than not, people won&rsquo;t know what their favourite something is. Ask someone for their favourite movie or a book, and she can&rsquo;t put her finger on one.</p>
<p>Being a favourite is also singular. What point is being just one person&rsquo;s favourite? You can&rsquo;t market that. Of course, as long as the someone in question is not famous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder if seeking to be someone&rsquo;s favourite is more satisfying than trying to be popular to everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seth Godin made this observation in <a href="https://seths.blog/2022/10/americas-favorite-pie/">one of his latest posts</a>. Well, it&rsquo;s not about satisfaction but the ease of selling.</p>

			 <p>I have never had the dark mode turned off since the option was made available on my devices. I did today. After an initial bout of pain, things don&rsquo;t look too bad. Instead, they look cleaner. The whole experience - the platform, the apps, the websites - is so very different.</p>
<p>One thing is pretty apparent - all the interfaces look better in the light mode. As if the apps are designed for the light mode first. The setting, the interface elements, and the colour palette look ingrained. With the dark mode, all apps look the same &ndash; white text on limited shades of dark background. Maybe that is the reason many people prefer this mode. Irrespective of the app, it looks the same.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind a diverse collection of interfaces. So against the wishes of the techie in me, I will extend this experiment for a bit longer on my smartphone. I will use it with the dark mode turned off. It can&rsquo;t be too bad, right?</p>

			 <p>Choices are abundant these days - more variety of cuisines, more brands of clothes, more range of devices, more solutions. More of the same, yet <em>different in imperceivable ways</em>. More is good, right?</p>
<p>Not when the dread of choosing paralyses me. Making a selection demands brain cycles, both while and after choosing. It needs time from you. If there is real money involved, the process is even more demanding. Fear of regret kicks in then.</p>
<p>Is the other one better? Cheaper? Would I hate this later? Will my family hate me for choosing this? Will this improve my life? Each question is more complex than the previous one.</p>
<p>In the false hope of &ldquo;saving&rdquo; time and money, I postpone choosing. My unmade decisions pile up, and so does the burden on me. It is a vicious cycle – I delay choosing because I feel vague pressure, a choice that only adds to my burden.</p>
<p>Not choosing is a choice too. Make it your default, and it will only make you weaker.</p>

			 <p>Ever since I published the Paper theme to Micro.blog, I wanted to port one with multiple columns and yet stay minimal as possible. I&rsquo;ve found one, and today I managed to port it to and customize it for Micro.blog. The theme, called <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/79">Anatole</a>, is a beautiful minimalist two-column theme. You can check for yourself in the screenshot below or see it live on <a href="https://amit-test.micro.blog/">my test blog</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The theme is <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/79">available in Micro.blog&rsquo;s Plug-ins directory</a> and can directly be installed from there. Note that <strong>the theme is compatible with Hugo 0.91</strong>, which is available as a setting on Micro.blog. You can follow the below general steps to install the theme.</p>
<ul>
<li>Uninstall any theme that you have installed as a plugin.</li>
<li>Set your current theme to blank and Hugo Version to 0.91 in the design section of your blog.</li>
<li>Make sure there are no other conflicting custom CSS configured for the previous theme.</li>
<li>Install the &ldquo;<a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/79">Anatole theme</a>&rdquo; plug-in from the directory.</li>
<li>Once the theme is successfully installed, you can configure the social icons displayed in the header by modifying the available options as plug-in settings.</li>
<li>Additionally, you can configure parameters to display full post content on the homepage, disable animations and provide a path to a custom favicon.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was fun to bring another option to Micro.blog&rsquo;s already brilliant collection themes. I hope you like this and that a few folks benefit from it. If you do, I would love to hear from you. All feedback is welcome.</p>

<p>I am happy when my phone guides me around a place, known or unknown. Alerts me of road closures or diversions. Reads the text in front of me. Or helps me with my quick queries or requests.</p>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>And I am only talking about the capabilities of the devices on me. I am surrounded by technology that brings a smile to my face every day throughout the day.</p>
<p>I can be frustrated by the things these gadgets cannot do well (or can&rsquo;t do at all). Or I can be angry with them when they alter my habits against my will.</p>
<p>But just as the technology is at fault for not acting responsibly, so am I for not using it sensibly. When <em>I wish</em> the technology to alter itself to not burden me, <em>I share</em> the responsibility to find ways to not be controlled by it.</p>
<p>Do I have enough levers? That&rsquo;s debatable. What isn&rsquo;t, though, is my love for technology.</p>

			 <p>If you write a blog and are interested in conversing with your readers, do include a link for the reader to do so right below your every post. I would love it if every blog post had a way for me to respond. A comment form. An email address for me to mail the writer at. Or even a link to the social media where the post is syndicated. Basically, redirect me, the reader, to any place where the conservation is taking place. I can, of course, theorise why most people have stopped doing that.</p>
<p>First, the spam industry has dampened one of the promises of the internet — having open connections with people on the web. We are afraid now that we will be bombarded by comments and messages that we have no interest in sifting through. Second, most blogging platforms have stopped providing an easy way to enable conversations, which came built-in with WordPress and others. It’s an added decision (and even a cost in some cases) for the writer to provide such an option to its reader. A trouble that many folks just don’t want to sign up for.</p>
<p>I wish that wasn’t the case. My conversations with people around the words I write have been an essential aspect of my blogging for the past many years. If you haven’t tried that, or you did but aren’t doing it actively anymore, give it a chance again.</p>
<p>You take the trouble so that your user doesn’t have to.</p>

			 <p>Our species' collective common sense is on a downward trend; my movie theatre experience yesterday proved this again. With mobile phones in their hands, they kill the vibe with the ringtones and flashes. A few pick up the calls in the middle of the movie. Some peek at their phones out of habit just to check the notifications. So what&rsquo;s fricking wrong with these folks? Can you not stay away from the dopamine-inducing notifications even for a couple of hours?</p>
<p>There is also a crazy trend on the rise recently. People are creating reels of theatre response — a highly anticipated scene begins, the entry of an important character or a dialogue or a fight sequence, and people have their smartphones out recording the screen. What the fuck, man!</p>
<p>I am ready to pay extra for watching a movie at a theatre with a &ldquo;no smartphone allowed&rdquo; policy. I know it&rsquo;s near impossible, but a guy can dream, can&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p>A sidetone, the movie I watched was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikram_Vedha_(2022_film)">Vikram Vedha</a>, and I absolutely loved it. I don&rsquo;t care that it&rsquo;s a remake. It is <em>remade</em> well, in the right spirit, and backed by solid performances.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781526647115">Stolen Focus</a> by Johann Hari today 📚</p>
<p>I loved the premise of this book but found the second half unconvincing. Sure, lack of sleep or hunger or extended work hours does lead to loss of focus. But they do harm our society in a lot of other ways. We can&rsquo;t point to every problem that plagues the world today and say it affects our focus. Similarly, ridding ourselves of the focus problem can help us solve even more significant issues. But without concrete actions, it is all talk.</p>
<p>The extent of topics that Hari wants to cover with the book is too spread for my liking. I wished it was more focused on the subject.</p>

			 <p>Even though I knew deep within that it was coming, the news of <a href="https://www.espn.in/tennis/story/_/id/34596649/roger-federer-announces-retirement-play-laver-cup-final-event">Federer&rsquo;s retirement</a> saddens me. Being an Indian, I never thought I would watch any sport as intently as I watched Cricket. Or cheer for anyone as loud as I did for India. Federer made me do both &ndash; this man is why I fell in love with Tennis.</p>
<p>I cheered every time he effortlessly hit those winners <em>precisely where he wanted</em>. There was some elegance to his aggression that always attracted me, something that the ferocity in the play of his competitors lacked. As his rivalry with Nadal grew, so did the craze amongst us tennis-crazy friends. The respect for both lived through many heartbreaks, one particular during undoubtedly <a href="https://youtu.be/f8YEiCAPAbg">the greatest match</a> of all time.</p>
<p>As the sport moved on, leaving the beauty of the master&rsquo;s gameplay behind, I moved away from the sport. I have never enjoyed the game since. Yet whenever Federer participated in a tournament, I refreshed the scores during his matches. I hoped that he managed to swat a winner against his tiring, ageing body. Just as he did through his graceful backhands over the years. Alas, it wasn&rsquo;t to be.</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing cheer to millions of faces. We <em>and the sport</em> will miss your game, GOAT.</p>

Though the answer to that question usually is &ldquo;well, it depends why you need it&rdquo;, I agree with all of the must-meet criteria that she lists down &ndash; good RAM,  good display, good keyboard (<em>with backlight</em>), good connectivity and good battery life.</p>
<p>In addition, portability and form factor matter to me. Too thick, large or heavy, and it no longer is a laptop in my eyes.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t get Apple&rsquo;s iPhone 14 lineup. Let me be upfront and say I have no intention of being an asshole. Or to troll Apple. I am genuinely curious if Apple has improved iPhone 14 (non-Pro) in any significant way over the last year&rsquo;s model. Even S models from yesteryears had more significant upgrades. If I am wrong, I must have missed reading something between the line.</p>
<p>If there ever was a generation of iPhones that the previous year&rsquo;s model could be recommended over, this lineup has to be the prime candidate.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780753553909">Think Again</a> by Adam Grant today 📚</p>
<p>Though the book is in no way short, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Grant presents numerous ideas across sections and chapters &ndash; some focused on individuals, others on teams. Some on one&rsquo;s personal life, others on the professional one. Given the recent trend of expanding trivial ideas into a book, I admire the depth Grant attempts with this book.</p>
<p>Sure, not everything works for me. Not all suggestions are practical. A few chapters and their conclusions contradict the more significant point being made. Some sections just have no relation to the central premise of thinking again. The conclusion sounds weakest as if it was added after the thought (something that Grant acknowledges in the Epilogue).</p>
<p>As I struggle today with forming opinions amidst the information overload, this was an essential read. Every help I get to <em>think better</em> is welcome.</p>

			 <p>I have been using a MacBook with Touch Bar for the past couple of weeks. I used this panel regularly for the first time. I can see why Apple wanted this to stick &ndash; when it works, it works well. For example, Zoom puts the buttons for full screen, mute, and video on/off front and centre. It, no doubt, speeds up the flow. But searching for the escape button is an absolute pain!</p>
<p>Apple screwed up the execution. Instead of <em>replacing</em> the row of function keys, this should have been an additional panel above the keyboard. It was ok even if this was available on the larger MacBooks only. But, alas. Apple knows better.</p>

			 <p>I wonder if no one on Micro.blog creates any type of long-form posts using the web editor. I can&rsquo;t be the only one who finds this interface too limiting. It is suitable only for short updates. The goal of keeping things simple shouldn&rsquo;t hamper the experience of writing posts. Whenever I attempt to write a long post with this interface, I instantly look for other options. Sure, I don&rsquo;t switch. But I would <em>love</em> to avoid having this feeling.</p>
<p>Saving and building on a draft is unnecessarily complicated. Keyboard shortcuts do not work consistently &ndash; undo/redo often messes up the post. This is exasperated by the already small editor window. In addition, the experience is not consistent between writing a new post and editing a draft.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time I have complained about the writing interface. I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/08/06/231037.html">wrote this</a> almost a year ago (and that wasn&rsquo;t the first either).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The editing experience remains poor for long-form posts – both from a desktop and a mobile device. It&rsquo;s a great system with a promising base, but still has a long way to go before I can use it for the longer form content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/the-web-new-post-page-needs-basic-features-please/1090">am I the only one</a> with the request. The editor is the most essential part of any blogging system. I hope Manton gets time to work on fixing it, an ask that&rsquo;s pending for too long now. Without this, the platform isn&rsquo;t fit for the blogging needs of full-length posts.</p>

			 <p>There was a time when I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2019/04/24/105500.html">listened to podcasts</a>. Then I stopped doing that. There was a time when I scrolled through Twitter and Facebook, and we all know that story. Eventually, I also <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/07/15/as-far-as.html">stopped watching YouTube</a> videos. I detached myself from every form of passive consumption. I came to this realisation, and here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/01/10/what-about-social.html">what I wrote</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All my concerns stem from this &ldquo;user-engagement-at-all-cost&rdquo; business practice. Irrespective of how pleasing this interaction feels in the moment, it leaves me furious for the time wasted. Twitter timeline is prone to do that. YouTube&rsquo;s homepage does that, and so does its recommendation engine. Instagram and Facebook feed do that. For me, even Reddit forums tend to do that. Debatable, but Podcasts do that too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I am either listening to audiobooks or reading books, newsletters or articles from the subscribed RSS feeds. Yet, I still feel I do not have enough time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have time to watch that 10-episode TV series. I don&rsquo;t have time to read the list of articles I have saved to read later. I don&rsquo;t have time to play games or read comic books. And I have accepted that I cannot consume these forms of content, for the lack of a better word.</p>
<p>But, it saddens me to realise I don&rsquo;t even have time to read everything I want. And I am not even looking at the growing list of to-read books.</p>
<p>How does one find the time?</p>
<p>I could read a book or keep up with my RSS subscriptions on a particular day. But unfortunately, I cannot do both. Maybe I don&rsquo;t know how to stop myself in time or structure my day in a routine.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, I don&rsquo;t have enough time to read all that there is to read. I have read a few articles and books that address this problem of the apparent shortage of time. But I haven&rsquo;t found a solution that works for any meaningful period.</p>
<p>Maybe, I need to make peace with the fact that I cannot keep up. I cannot keep up with the growing list of brilliant books. I cannot keep up with the gifted writers churning beautiful essays. And, with a heavy heart, accept that I am okay with it.</p>
<p>Disengaging from passive consumption has helped me. But there&rsquo;s too much good content that I can&rsquo;t keep up with.</p>

			 <p>I am not a horror movie fan. I have seen a few over the years but do not enjoy them. With age, my patience with them has further gone down. I do not watch this genre at all anymore. Or so I thought.</p>
<p>I was recently reminded of my dislike as I read <a href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-horror-movies-of-all-time/">this list</a> from the editors at Rotten Tomatoes. I realized that there <em>are</em> few movies in this genre that I have enjoyed. Or I do still enjoy. The likes of The Mist or Jaws Or The Shining. Or the number one on the list, Psycho. Or the one I thoroughly enjoyed recently - Get Out.</p>
<p>Basically, I don&rsquo;t mind psychological thrillers. Or ones with creatures. But I am done watching haunted houses and ghosts and unnecessary gore.</p>
<p>That said, I do enjoy reading the plots of the movies, predominantly from the horror genre, that I have no interest in. I have read so many movie plots on Wikipedia. I was anyway not going to watch the movie. By reading the plot, I at least know that the one twist the movie was sold on is shit.</p>

			 <p>I watched <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_batman">The Batman</a> today &ndash; I am glad that after a few terrible few showings, we have a good setting again. It&rsquo;s not a perfect movie &ndash; it&rsquo;s too long and too thin. But I loved the way it&rsquo;s shot, it does &ldquo;look and sound brilliant&rdquo;. The first half is particularly gripping. I didn&rsquo;t like the Riddler though, his eccentricities felt forced.</p>
<p>That said though, the first thing this movie made me do was rewatch a few sequences from The Dark Knight series. The heights that Nolan took this superhero to is hard to scale.</p>

			 <p>I no longer am the prolific blogger that I once was. I won&rsquo;t comment on everything that I read these days. Or post every thought I have.</p>
<p>I read what a few people write and realize maybe I am not as natural a blogger as I thought at one point. Writing doesn&rsquo;t come <em>naturally</em> to me. Knowing that English isn&rsquo;t my primary language, I knew what I write in the language won&rsquo;t sound natural either. In my school, even my English teacher didn&rsquo;t speak in English. English became my primary communication language pretty late in my life. So I am aware that the way I use some words or the structure of my sentence must sound wrong to English-speaking readers.</p>
<p>Not that I blame my struggle with this foreign language for my recent slump in writing. It&rsquo;s true that I never wished to write perfect prose. The recognition that it conveyed what I wanted was good enough for me. But it&rsquo;s equally true that writing is not easy for me. It takes effort.</p>
<p>I would love to believe that my writing has improved over these 15 years. But I am also conscious that my desire to write frequently, differently, hasn&rsquo;t improved. Instead, it has been impaired recently.</p>
<p>I feel bad when I struggle to garner the drive to word my thoughts and I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/07/20/there-are-times.html">wrote about</a> <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/07/21/i-find-and.html">my frustration</a> <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/07/24/an-unpopular-opinion.html">a few times</a> recently. Looking at my blog without anything meaningful added newly makes me feel worse.</p>
<p>Maybe this space needs a break. Maybe I do?</p>

<p>A short, but brilliant read. Housel writes in an easy-to-follow manner even though the topic he talks about is not. Some might say this belongs to a series of blog posts. But the chapters and respective takeaways sound coherent.</p>
<p>As Housel mentions, there cannot be a single investing strategy for every person out there. Each individual&rsquo;s background is different. Their goals are different. And so are their perspectives. In the same spirit, two individuals cannot have the same set of takeaways from this book.</p>

			 <p>I have been a PC guy since I was 10 years old. The first version that I used was Windows 95. I stayed the longest with Windows 98. I fell in love with Windows XP even on my PC hardware that didn&rsquo;t support the OS well then.</p>
<p>However, what I had for this platform wasn&rsquo;t love. For the small town I am from, Windows was the default platform. At home, in school and at work. Mac OS wasn&rsquo;t a name anyone had heard. Linux was limited to textbooks.</p>
<p>I dabbled with the latter during my bachelor&rsquo;s and the developer in me was instantly captivated. It wasn&rsquo;t ready to replace the default OS on my desktop though. There was still some time to go before it could go mainstream. So like most folks around me, I dual-booted Windows and Linux.</p>
<p>However, I believe things have improved since then. There are many &ldquo;flavours&rdquo; of Linux today that target users beyond developers. Why not then should I give them a try again?</p>
<p>So I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/05/30/i-have-replaced.html">have been running Linux</a> as my primary OS for more than a few months now. I haven&rsquo;t missed my default platform yet. It may not still be ready for all the people that Microsoft targets with Windows. But it is ready to be the default platform for many tech-minded folks out there.</p>
<p>I am not going back to Windows anymore. I don&rsquo;t have any incentive,</p>
<p>PS: I am trying <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/google-chrome-os-flex-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-use-it/ar-AAZrwUy">Chrome OS Flex</a> currently. I am pretty impressed with this flavour of an operating system. It&rsquo;s light and fast. Plus it also runs Linux now. Except for the fear of Google, this platform has a lot going for it.</p>

<p>A fascinating list this. A few that resonated with me were saying “I don’t know” or “I don’t have an opinion” when you don’t&quot; or &ldquo;don’t drink (alcohol), even when you’re expected to&rdquo;. A handy reference.</p>

			 <p>My daughter regularly uses the assistants at home &ndash; for timers, for reminders. To play songs that she loves. She even asks questions about things she gets curious about. She loves Alexa and talks to her as if talking to a friend. She can work with Google Assistant &ndash; it always gets the job done.</p>
<p>However, she doesn&rsquo;t like Siri. I set a timer for her with Siri today &ndash; it didn&rsquo;t take her long to move it to Echo. Well, I can&rsquo;t blame her. She asked Siri how much time was remaining on her timer. Siri replied, &ldquo;I am sorry, I can&rsquo;t do that here.&rdquo; <em>How can you not do something so basic?</em></p>
<p>Once my daughter was done, I asked Siri to cancel the timer. Well, she repeated that she can&rsquo;t do that. Sigh!</p>

			 <p>I suck at emojis &ndash; I don&rsquo;t understand this language. Why are there so many representations of the quality of laughter? Grinning, Smiling, Beaming and whatnot. I understand each word means something different, but conveying that through the right emoji is a task in itself. I mean seriously, what&rsquo;s the difference between emoji representing &ldquo;Grinning Face with Smiling Eyes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beaming Face with Smiling Eyes&rdquo;? I will never know that.</p>
<p>We have around 3600 emojis (<a href="https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-counts.html">3633 to be exact</a>), which include gender or skin tones. Isn&rsquo;t that number too large? Plus it keeps growing every year. Sure, add new emojis that people want and anticipate. But remove a few tens that get hardly used. Who uses Dotted Line Face 🫥? What does it even mean?</p>
<p>Emoji is a powerful language &ndash; fastest growing at that. But it need not grow meaninglessly.</p>
<p>Side note, did you know 😭 is <a href="https://emojipedia.org/stats/">the most used emoji</a>? It represents the pain that is using the right emoji.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday, I ranted about <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/07/15/as-far-as.html">how Youtube is aggressively pushing Shorts</a> in their feeds and recommendations. Of course, the quality had taken a huge nosedive. Well, just look at the explore tab of YouTube. I very rarely do, that section always had poor-quality videos. But at least they were full-length ones. Now it is full of shorts with each having millions of views.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so much collective time wasted. We need to move on from shaming social media and its addictive nature. These short videos are ruining our habits and I see very few are complaining.</p>

			 <p>As far as time wastage goes, short video services are the new social media. YouTube Shorts, Reels whatever. I have realized this mindless format of the content is eating up too much of my productive time. YouTube, in itself, was bad. But at least there was a chance that I would learn something. With Shorts, it&rsquo;s a total waste of hours, a minute at a time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t watch Reels because, well, I don&rsquo;t use Instagram. Or Tiktok. Or <em>whatever app that&rsquo;s trending now</em>. But I keep going back to YouTube often when I have short time to pass. I hate that the app is aggressively pushing the Shorts nowadays.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that the videos are trash. They are neither fun nor informative. They register only as much as a dented luxury car would &ndash; I go &ldquo;huh, that&rsquo;s odd&rdquo; and move on.</p>

Each chapter is a nugget of inspiration, of motivation, of reminders for what matters, presented in the most <em>no-nonsense</em> way by Matt Haig. 📚</p>

			 <p>Almost every morning, I get a notification from Day One reminding me of an entry I had made on this day in some previous year. It always brings a smile to my face. Most entries are from some 8-10 years back when my daughter was growing up. I am so pleased with myself that I have made these entries. I relive the charm and the excitement of spending time with a growing child.</p>
<p>There are no notifications that I look forward to more than the ones from Day One. This is a worthy investment, both the subscription cost and the cost in terms of time to note the entries. The words I might have found meaningless then read like a heartfelt memory today.</p>

			 <p><em>I</em> don’t write a newsletter well. <em>I</em> don’t understand this medium. I have tried it a few times now. The first time, I published it as a links log, sharing links that I found useful. Then I made it personal, a letter about what’s up with me. It could well have been a blog post, every time. A weekly digest of my posts was a good tradeoff between a mindless link log and why-can’t-this-be-blog-post thought. But it felt meaningless.</p>
<p>To be frank, I don’t want to sign up for the added dance around subscribers and their numbers. I like it when I don’t know anything about who reads what I write. Also, I enjoy it when I am not forced to stick to a schedule of any sort. There are periods when I am highly active, writing, and sharing regularly. But then there are times when I don’t.</p>
<p>Newsletter wants to force a schedule onto me. Without a schedule, a newsletter is just another outlet for my blog posts.</p>
<p>I am an instinctive writer, my writing does not have any structure. Or nature. I write about anything and everything that interests me now. Because I <em>read</em> anything and everything that interests me now. My blog serves me best for the form of writing I do. Newsletters work for many — I enjoy reading them. But the form is not a natural fit for me.</p>
<p>So, I  am done with my newsletters experiment. Every issue I have published <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/categories/essays/">is available on my blog</a> as an essay. I intend on keeping it this way. <a href="https://amitgawande.com/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> continues to exist.</p>

<p>The sense that one has become the instrument of invention is so satisfying that I find it truly stupefying that anyone would claim that artists are motivated to create primarily by the money they might get from such miracles. Not to say they shouldn&rsquo;t be paid. Paying them provides them with more time and liberty to channel art. But it&rsquo;s a rare artist who&rsquo;s in it for the money. A real artist creates because he has no choice. He is pressed into the involuntary service of art, and thereby, humanity.</p>

<p>When writing, and also when doing research for writing, it’s important to get the details right, but that doesn’t always mean what you might think. Economy of detail is usually better than excess, which raises the critical question about which details matter most.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An insightful read this, <a href="https://mattgemmell.com/verisimilitude/">Verisimilitude by Matt Gemmell</a>. I found this suggestion really on the mark.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research is a distillation. You’ll spend two hours reading, to get four paragraphs of notes, which provide eight words of story — but those eight words will take the reader into the world you’ve created, and create the impression that your character really is there, or really knows about this topic. Just make sure it’s either unremarkable that they would know those things, or that their knowledge has been explicitly accounted for.</p>

<p>While writing short stories that I based on some amount of research, I myself have struggled at times to know how much is enough. This was a good reminder from Matt.</p>

			 <p>A smartphone with a case is just not the same device. I have never used a device without a case ever. A slippery slab of fragile glass just doesn’t feel comfortable sitting in my hand. So, I just wrap it in a case and carry it along. It gives the device a physical and me a psychological cushion against any accidental falls. But every time I take the device out of the case for cleaning, putting it back in the case feels like a crime. It loses all its charm. Every device looks the same with a case on — the camera bump, the notch, the punch-hole fail to help.</p>
<p>As I hold this device in my hand again, about to commit a crime against it, I am seriously considering not going through with it. Will the worst happen? By writing about it, have I already jinxed it?</p>

<p>It had a brilliant premise — unique and fascinating. However, I didn&rsquo;t enjoy the many turns it took in the second half. There were a lot of moments when the book felt stretched, unnecessarily rambling along when the point was already made. I didn&rsquo;t like the simplistic conclusion either after Crouch had so well established the intricacies of the plot.</p>

			 <p>Writing publicly, with the voice of your readers chirping at the back of your mind, is ineffective. You write for interaction – that’s futile. Most social media posts belong to this category. You are reined back by the voice — you write <em>for</em> someone else. The response you expect from them, your readers, provides you the lead. You write not what you like, you write what you think your reader likes.</p>

			 <p>I have come across many guess-the-word games recently, mostly after Wordle. <a href="https://semantle.com/">Semantle</a> is another one, but is different in many ways. It&rsquo;s not limited in number of attempts. The help page says, &ldquo;You will need more than six guesses. You will probably need dozens of guesses&rdquo;. Sounds about right. Plus it has hints. Yet it feels difficult and exciting. Do give it a try when you have some time.</p>
<p>PS: It took me 21 guesses, 3 hints to get today&rsquo;s word.</p>

			 <p>I have released an upgrade (v1.1) to Paper theme for Micro.blog today that allows modifying the default behaviour of the homepage. It includes a setting now to display full post content on the homepage of the blog. Here’s how the homepage with this setting on will look like. You can also check the same on <a href="https://amit-test.micro.blog">my test blog</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is one of the most asked for features since the first release. I could never get the look right without ruining the spirit of the theme. Or so I like to believe because the change isn’t too significant in itself. So, irrespective of which option you decide to go with, the homepage should feel as part of the original simple and clean theme.</p>
<p>If you are using the Paper theme, look out for the upgrade option in Plugins. It should be enabled soon. As always, if you find any bug or want any improvements, kindly let me know either as <a href="https://github.com/am1t/microdotblog-paper/issues/new">GitHub issue</a> or connect with me on <a href="https://micro.blog/amit">Micro.blog</a> / via <a href="mailto:reply@amitgawande.com">email</a>.</p>

			 <p>I read a lot many long-form posts that are published with Substack these days. I know that’s anecdotal, but I wonder if Substack is becoming a blogging platform of choice for folks now. Or newsletters are newsletters no more? Well, what is a newsletter?</p>
<p>I like when a newsletter is more than just a list of links. Or a bowl of jumbled, unrelated recommendations. Not that I don’t enjoy them — I appreciate the effort that goes in curating these best-of reads. I have found them useful many a time. But deep down, I <em>love</em> reading letters. It reminds me of the days when I used to post handwritten physical mails to my family and close friends. Those words had an innate charm and closeness. I enjoy a newsletter that’s a letter first.</p>
<p>That tangential thought aside, I believe Substack is a publishing platform for newsletters first. But given the way it is set up, it is also a publishing platform for the long-form posts. If you don’t subscribe to a publication, most probably you are going to read it as a blog post. That’s what seems to be happening to me.</p>

			 <p>With many avenues of tracking and improving my well-being already around me, I have decided to make the best use of them. I know I am not good at maintaining a healthy routine for any meaningful duration. Yet, I want to give myself another chance to succeed at forming one by constant nudges and tickles.</p>
<p>A reference to <a href="https://www.wholelifechallenge.com">Whole Life Challenge</a> (h/t <a href="https://www.cygnoir.net/2022/04/16/i-made-it.html">Halsted Bernard</a>) with its pointed question “What is healthy to you?” front and centre came in handy. The tagline, “don’t try to fit health and wellness into your life. Fit your life into the context of health and wellness” resonated with me. I always had the tools that allow me to track my progress towards a healthy lifestyle; with the recommendations from this challenge, I know what I need to track. I am not undertaking any challenge, but I am going to follow along.</p>
<p>So, I am tracking the seven habits – nutrition, hydrate, exercise, mobilise, sleep, well-being and reflect. With health apps from Samsung and Google, I make note of everything I eat, being cognisant of my diet. I don’t want to cut down on anything yet, but just understand what goes in. Keeping myself hydrated is not a problem I face, I drink enough water regularly.</p>
<p>Though I already do the running and stretching pretty regularly, I am now consciously walking while carrying out the daily chores instead of riding my motor scooter. Though I can’t sleep with a watch on, I now manually enter my hours of sleep. Sure, I miss out on the detailed reports of my sleep pattern, but this is better than nothing. With the bedtime mode scheduled on my smartphone, the screen goes greyscale, reminding me to rid myself of the clingy device. It helps!</p>
<p>Building a habit for well-being has been difficult for me. Meditation, the only well-being activity that I know of, never stuck. I can meditate, but I don’t do this with the right spirit. A constant thought of “am I doing this right” keeps pestering me throughout, and I know I’m <em>not</em> doing it right. Well, who knew there are other well-being practises too – picking up a book, reaching out to a friend or organising a disheveled space. Ah, now <em>that</em> I can do. And do well.</p>
<p>All said, these are early days. I am just a week into tracking these habits and I have already missed out on a couple each day. (I am using a wonderfully simple app, Loop Habit Tracker, to track these). But I am allowing myself the leniency.</p>

			 <p>Mumbai Indians (MI) lost another match yesterday — this year’s IPL has been boring. The two statements are independent, mutually exclusive. Or so I like to believe. Since the core of the team was broken, players distributed across the teams, I just can’t connect with the team anymore.</p>
<p>We just had the last IPL some 5 months back, didn’t we? And here we go again already. The lust to milk the most out of the hottest property on Indian television had to come back to bite them in the bums. They are killing the sport for generations, old and young. 🏏</p>

			 <p>I have been pretty happy with <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/03/27/i-upgraded-to.html">Galaxy S22</a> that I recently purchased, and yet, I find it surprising that my friend’s circle chose it over iPhones everytime to click pictures. This choice is driven by Samsung’s preference to make the pictures look better, clearer over Apple’s to make them look close to real. People who understand photography will always prefer the latter, the most of the mainstream will prefer the former. No surprise, some unknown Android devices keep winning the blind smartphone camera challenges that tech reviewers carry out, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp4nWm59esI">one Marques Brownlee does</a>.</p>
<p>A tangential thought, what do you call the folks that are not experts? The non-reviewers. The enthusiasts. Or the nerds? These are the folks that form the majority market, ones that most companies target. I always struggle to find a term that isn’t derogatory to either side. I at times call them common folks, but it doesn’t sound right to me. Neither does “normal” — that makes the tech enthusiasts, the group I belong to, non-normal? Again, doesn’t sound right. I recently heard someone call this section “muggles”. Yuck! Have people even read the books?</p>
<p>Anyway, back to my device selection. I have been part of the Apple ecosystem for a long time. When I recently switched to Android with a OnePlus device, I was worried that I may miss the benefits of the ecosystem. Well, I did. But not enough to make me go back to the Apple devices. With a Galaxy smartphone now, I had a chance to get back to an ecosystem of sorts again. Samsung has over the years build a viable alternative for each Apple device. A shameless copy initially, now all of them have an identity of their own. One such device is Galaxy Watch 4 which is different from Apple Watch, yet equally powerful when paired with a Galaxy smartphone. For the past week, I have been enjoying how both these devices work together. Samsung’s strategy looks to be working.</p>

			 <p>I can’t remember the last time I enjoyed listening to a book as much as I did <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary">Project Hail Mary</a> by Andy Weir. Of course, Weir deserves a lot of credit for writing such a smart book. But I am equally impressed by the performance, the voice acting by Ray Porter. I have rarely listened to an audiobook where I can’t separate the narrator and the central character in the book. Most of the folks read the book, performing the dialogs by characters differently every now and then. That wasn’t the case with Porter — he became the character Ryland Grace. The experience it leaves the listener with is absolutely brilliant. I could ignore many of the faults of the book, the plot because I was completely engrossed by the performance.</p>
<p>Sure, even the book is good. I can’t say the same for the writing. But who cares. There’s an innate charm with the way Weir writes his books. Or the way he structures his plot. There’s a lot of science that’s hard to swallow, at times almost at the verge of being stupid. Yet, it doesn’t come out as lazy to me. And I am not alone to feel so; Brandon Sanderson <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/project-hail-mary-review/">writes this in his review</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, what I love that Andy does is he shows that optimism can be compelling as a narrative. I don’t mind the grimdark movement. I think there’s lots of great books that have come out of it. And I like dystopian science fiction quite a bit. Some of my favorite stories are very depressing dystopian stories, such as Harrison Bergeron. But there is a certain electric-fun to optimism. And Andy Weir writes optimistic science fiction, optimistic hard science fiction, even when terrible things are happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I can word the way I feel about Weir’s writing any better. He did that successfully with Martian. And he outdoes himself by being even more audacious with Project Hail Mary.</p>
<p>The book gets four star from me. And an added star just for Roy. No surprise, it’s rated (almost) five star on Audible. Absolutely brilliant!</p>

			 <p>This week saw the schools and offices welcoming the students and employees in-person, and I realised I have entered the post-lockdown phase of the pandemic now. For a body and mind that has gotten used to the sluggish at-home routine, the rush-filled days are exhausting. I haven’t gotten used to this routine yet.</p>
<p>It isn’t as if I am working more. Rather, I must be working a lot less than what I was when I could focus more at home. For the majority of the times, that is. But the mere fact that I am at the office floors surrounded by the buzzing coworker space makes the stay tiring. I can see the same behaviour in my daughter. She was extremely pumped to join the school, and still is. However, even she is drained once she arrives home from the school. Well, her reason might be different – surrounded by friends new and old, she is bursting with energy. She has missed her classrooms. And the busy routine. There’s satisfaction on her tired face.</p>
<p>Is it all bad for me? Well, to be frank, not at all. I have enjoyed the company of coworkers in the last week. The way we work when we can interact face-to-face is very different from when it is all virtual. We take many decisions without planning and booking a time on the calendar; as a result, we close more discussions. The virtual mode of working restrained us through the need to over-plan. Over-schedule. It’s surprising how free I felt when I could simply walk to a person and talk.</p>
<p>Sure, the away-from-home routine has impacted my reading and writing habits, too. Well, to be frank, those habits are impacted for quite some time now. I need to get back, find a window to think in this hectic, unsteady life. It’s not new to me, but it’s funny how a couple of years at home has made me forget the office lifestyle. What was the work-life balance that we talked so much about, again?</p>
<p>Well, that’s a thought to ponder over some other time.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s a downside. When life keeps me busy, as it has for the past few weeks, I can’t word these letters. But I have stopped making it too much of an issue. It’s ok if I cannot send the letter out. Anyway, I am not doing this to gather a follower base, but to send a personal letter to the few interested friends.</p>

			 <p>iPhone SE is a lazy upgrade — Apple is a boring company. If there is one thing that will dent the juggernaut that is Apple, it is their tendency to play safe to cater to the majority. <em>We need to sell in millions, so we can’t experiment too much on design.</em> I understand the why. Consumer aren’t supposed to care.</p>
<p>The strategy might work in US. Apple might throw numbers to prove that SE sells well worldwide. But all they are doing is to keep a manufacturing unit running since last 2014.</p>
<p>India is an extremely competitive market on price and I am tired of waiting for Apple to price their low end devices well.</p>
<p>SE needs a better, modern design. Be bold and make one custom for smaller devices. Or stay lazy and make iPhone 12 mini your new SE. Or if that&rsquo;s too premium, make iPhone 11 the new SE. But kill those bezels already.</p>

			 <p>I have recently been a lot picky about the stuff I buy. Or the subscriptions I sign up for. Or the projects I undertake. I was never good at it. And I don’t claim that I have mastered the skill now. I still struggle to recognise the price that I would eventually have to pay. First look, the listed cost looks cheap. But I have started asking now, “<a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2022/01/everything-must-be-paid-for-twice/">can I pay the second price</a>?”</p>
<p>The answer is usually <em>a big no</em>. David Cain succinctly words the reasons behind this problem of mine (the above linked essay is a must-read).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe this is one reason our modern lifestyles can feel a little self-defeating sometimes. In our search for fulfillment, we keep paying first prices, creating a correspondingly enormous debt of unpaid second prices. Yet the rewards of any purchase – the reason we buy it at all — stay locked up until both prices are paid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could also closely associate with the side effects of this problem, as David lists them. This made me acutely aware of the gravity of this pilling debt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This scarcity feeling creates one of the major side-effects of our insurmountable second-price debt: we reflexively overindulge in entertainment and other low-second-price pleasures –- phone apps, streaming services, and processed food — even though their rewards are often only marginally better than doing nothing. This stuff is attractive because it takes little effort (and we’re tired from working to pay for so many first prices) but it can eat up a ton of time, depleting the second-price budget even further.</p>

			 <p>Whenever I wake my daughter up in the morning (thankfully, I don’t have to do it every day), she has this habit of pushing her face further deep into her pillow and just raising her one finger. It conveys <em>just one more minute, Dad!</em> It’s so adorable, and freshens me up every time she does that. And I play along as a dutiful father.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter for how long she has been in the bed. She may have slept a good 10 hours of good night’s sleep, she still has her finger up when I go and wake her up. It is the sleep that she gets in the extra minute that’s dear to her.</p>
<p>We love this little game of ours. When I <em>knowingly</em> wake her up early, and she <em>knowingly</em> raises her finger up. When that minute is up, I act tough and pull her out of the bed. She knows I am acting. I know she knows. Both of us wear a smug smile on our faces.</p>

			 <p>Last week was about hope and shattered dreams. It was a lesson in staying positive amidst all the roadblocks and pushbacks. It began with, on the personal front, hopes for a better, different tomorrow — but as the week drew closer to the end, I was made aware that there’s still a lot of work to do. That I am not “worthy” of this better tomorrow yet. I know I am. But after a point, all you can do is stay positive. Stay prepared for the time when the tide invariably will turn.</p>
<p>Staying prepared is all we did. I wish I could dwell more into details. But I cannot.</p>
<p>Talking about the week, my daughter had her culmination day in her school. She was already saddened that it was online, not in person. Online schooling has overstayed its welcome now; she longs to visit the physical school. She misses her friends and her routine when she is surrounded by a learning environment. Staring at a computer screen with teachers and friends peering back at her is not her definition of involved learning. I am proud of how effectively she has managed schooling for the past 2 years. But I feel for her.</p>
<p>Anyway, she had to talk about a topic which she prepared well for and yet was extremely nervous about. The ill-timed power loss and resultant network drop made it even more terrible experience for her than what she feared. She stayed positive, joined from an iPad with a mobile hotspot. She gave her best, but she had already lost half her interest. All I and my wife could do was to explain how it was nothing to get disheartened about, to make her look at the positives. But I knew deep down that she is no longer enjoying this digital form of schooling.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>This post was sent as an introduction for this week&rsquo;s issue of <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/subscribe/">my weekly newsletter</a>. I have realized the updates I begin my newsletter with every week get lost once it is out. So I publish these as individual posts.</p>

			 <p>Micro.blog is a blogging platform built over Hugo, a fast static site engine. Given the way it is structured, every theme created for Hugo can potentially work with the blog hosted by Micro.blog. However, there are a few aspects added to Hugo that are specific to the way things work in Micro.blog. These need to be included as part of the themes to make the most of the features of this platform.</p>
<p>This article presents a non-extensive list of things that should be evaluated and included while porting a theme that is made for Hugo to Micro.blog. I have written this as I dug into the existing themes <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/01/23/paper-a-clean.html">while porting Paper theme</a>. As of this writing, a theme is considered as a plug-in in Micro.blog. Hence, many references link back to the way plug-ins work with the platform.</p>
<p>To reiterate, this is not an extensive list. Based on how a theme, that is being ported, is set up, one may need only a few of these steps or may need a few more than those listed below. However, this should be a good start to get a working version of the theme out for testing. If there are any issues or concerns, please reply to our email addresses.</p>
<h2 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h2>
<p>Of course, the article assumes that you have already identified the theme that you want to port. The <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io">Hugo theme Showcase</a> is a good place to check for all the wonderful themes available.</p>
<p>Though you are not required to have a detailed understanding of Hugo to port a theme, the knowledge on the below aspects should be handy.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-themes/59">Custom Theme support in Micro.blog</a></li>
<li>A basic understanding of <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/">Hugo templates</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/">directory structure</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>The first step to get started is to access and clone the repository of the theme to be ported. You can either do this offline on your desktop or directly create a new theme in Micro.blog with mentioning the theme repository URL as Clone URL. You could then select this newly added theme as a custom theme for your <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/09/04/microblog-test-blogs.html">test blog</a>. This allows you to find out what breaks and also validate the additional modifications that you make to the theme.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For a theme to work, you only need a few folders and files — a typical Micro.blog theme directory structure is provided below for reference.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">.
├── theme.toml
├── config.json
├── plugin.json
├── layouts
└── static
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li><code>theme.toml</code> - Contains bare meta information about the theme, like name, description, license, features, author.</li>
<li><code>config.json</code> - Contains any properties required and referenced by the template files of the theme. If the property is to be provided by the user, typically it should be taken as a setting, defined in a separate file.</li>
<li><code>plugin.json</code> - Contains meta information about the custom theme to be displayed as part of plugin repository. It also defines the feature settings that can be provided by user while plugin configuration. Refer to <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/plug-ins/104">official guide on plug-ins</a> for more details about this file.</li>
<li><code>layouts</code> - A folder that stores <code>html</code> templates that defines how views of different content types will be rendered on a website with the style.</li>
<li><code>static</code> - A folder that stores all the static content like CSS, JavaScript, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get rid of all the other unnecessary files and folders and only keep the above-mentioned ones. This will keep the list of files in which changes are to be made manageable.</p>
<p>Before we move ahead, here’s a list of basic template files in the <code>layouts</code> folders that one would modify typically to port a theme.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/_default/list.html</code> - A template that renders pages with multiple pieces of content, this includes the homepage. A homepage can also be independently styled by defining a template <code>index.html</code> in the root directory.</li>
<li><code>/_default/single.html</code> or <code>posts/single.html</code> - A template that renders a page for a single post.</li>
<li><code>/_default/list.archivehtml.html</code> - A template that renders the archive page of your website.</li>
<li><code>/partials/head.html</code> - A template that defines the <code>head</code> section of your final rendered HTML.</li>
<li><code>/partials/header.html</code> - A template that defines the header of your blog. This typically includes the site title, subtitle, navigation menu etc.</li>
<li><code>/partials/footer.html</code> - A template that defines the footer of your blog. This typically includes the copyrights, author information etc.</li>
<li><code>/_default/baseof.html</code> - A base template that stitches all the above defined partials together, including the main sections defined in list and single template pages above.</li>
</ul>
<p>A theme might have all the above files, or have just a subset of these. In case a theme does not provide a particular template file, one from the basic theme (which forms the base of every theme) of Micro.blog is used.</p>
<p>Moreover, make sure you configure the appropriate Hugo Version to be used for your blog. Micro.blog allows two versions of Hugo to be used, 0.54 and 0.91, the latest being relatively new. Many themes may not work with the older 0.54 version of the Hugo, typically indicated by the <code>min_version</code> configuration in the <code>theme.toml</code>. If the value is above 0.54, set the Hugo version to be used as 0.91. This can be done via Design → Hugo Version.</p>
<h2 id="fix-the-broken-pages">Fix the Broken Pages</h2>
<p>Usually, the home page might not render the list of all the posts with the ported templates. This is often due to the wrong selection of the posts. To check the selection, visit the list template mentioned above and fix the file which is fetching all the posts. It should typically look like below where you pull all the regular pages where type is defined as post.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">{{ $pages = where .Site.RegularPages &#34;Type&#34; &#34;post&#34; }}
</code></pre></div><p>A similar fix would also need to be applied to the archive page’s template, if it is defined custom. The archive page would also need styling the components appropriately, as these are all Micro.blog specific classes, not part of the default styling of the theme.</p>
<p>Next, you will have to fix the templates to handle the title-less posts. Most posts published with Micro.blog are, well, micro-posts with no titles. So, wherever a Title is referenced, it should be wrapped in a <code>&amp;#123;&amp;#123; if .Title }}</code> condition. So, the title reference at every place should read like below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">{{ if .Title }}
	&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">h2</span>&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">h2</span>&gt;
{{ end }}
</code></pre></div><p>The title-less posts might also need minor styling fixes. A typical pitfall is when a post permalink is only available with title. So, a micro-post requires a different element to carry the permalink, mostly the date-time of the post.</p>
<p>Another aspect that is typically broken is rendering of the taxonomy. Most of the themes in Hugo use tags to define the taxonomy. Micro.blog uses categories and hence need to fetch them differently. So at every place a template mentions tags, mostly on list template, archives template and single template, replace them with categories. This primarily involves replacing all the references of <code>.Params.tags</code> with <code>.Params.categories</code>.</p>
<p>With these changes handled, you should have a working website that renders correctly. However, it is still not customised to include the benefits that Micro.blog brings to the table.</p>
<h2 id="add-microblog-specific-tags">Add Micro.blog Specific Tags</h2>
<p>Micro.blog packs the key IndieWeb principles, like IndieAuth, MicroPub, Webmentions, out-of-box for all websites hosted with the platform. However, this does involve defining a few relevant aspects at appropriate places. In addition, the platform is also rich in the ways a user not adept with coding can customise their website to their liking, with support for providing custom CSS, footer and plug-ins. Enabling these also need relevant components to be defined.</p>
<p>The changes to be made are in two files. First, modify the partials template that defines the head section of your website, <code>/partials/head.html</code>.</p>

<p>The difficulty involved in porting a Hugo theme to Micro.blog depends completely on the complexity of the original theme. Though it is difficult to extensively cover all the changes required, fixing the things that are broken and adding support for the Micro.blog specific features and tags is all it takes. This article attempted to list down the majority of the identified changes.</p>
<p>In the future, the way of including the Micro.blog specific changes may be simplified significantly. This article would be updated accordingly to reflect the same. However, the awareness of the changes being done allows one to appreciate the hidden complexity and beauty of the platform that is Micro.blog.</p>

			 <p>I find <a href="https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/historyculture/douglas-corrigan.htm">the story of Douglas Corrigan</a> pretty fascinating and inspiring. Sometimes the wrong way is the right way. All that matters is your intention and people’s perception.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having flown his nine year-old, $900 Curtiss Robin to New York, Corrigan fueled up and took off after announcing that he planned to return to Los Angeles. When next heard from, Corrigan and his old plane were in Dublin, Ireland, where he said, &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Corrigan. I left New York yesterday morning headed for California, but I got mixed up in the clouds and must have flown the wrong way.&rdquo; And so was born the wry legend of &ldquo;Wrong Way&rdquo; Corrigan.</p>

			 <p>I am on a #30day challenge of not accessing any of the social timelines and have signed out from them in all my browsers. I will continue to post to my blog, and hence cross-post to Twitter. But to aid myself to stay away from timeline, I won’t access the mention page either. So, no replies.</p>
<p>I want to understand what impact the timelines have on my focus — I have been struggling with that since the last few months. It’s time to take some action.</p>
<p>Are social media timelines the only cause? I’m sure they are not. But my intension is to find out if they are <em>one of the causes</em> and to what extent.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/02/15/why-microblog-works.html">Why Micro.blog works for me?</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/02/15/why-microblog-works.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-02-15 19:31:00 &#43;0530">Feb 15, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have settled on a platform for my blog which works the best for me — Micro.blog. There are reasons why the other platforms don&rsquo;t interest me. And I want to talk about them. Why now, you say? Well, recent and sudden interest in the Write.as platform among the folks I follow the words from made me momentarily pause. So here&rsquo;s the write up, first on why what in Micro.blog works for me.</p>
<p>For starter, it suits well for both the micro and long-form posts. It has apps for all platforms that I primarily use Mac and Android (Web is good for Windows, though I would still love an app there). Quick notes are best made with the apps, especially so from smartphone. For such posts that are long, titled, Ulysses works perfectly well for me. No other CMS can ever work as well as a native application.</p>
<p>The platform is built on Hugo. And I <em>love</em> Hugo. I hosted my blog for the longest with Hugo. I love the submodule systems with Hugo. Building extensions in your templates is so easy, and I have gotten comfortable with it. For a few, it might be <code>PHP</code> and WordPress. However, I could never get comfortable with that.</p>
<p>Manton has added just enough around Hugo to make it even more useful — the APIs, the apps, the social aspects, the open plug-in and theming systems and, the most valuable, its community. I visit the platform for inspiration, and many posts start right there. All this makes Micro.blog a lot more powerful, getting rid of the issues I had with Hugo, mainly the editing workflow with the static site. And I am not even talking about the smarter features life filters, bookmarks, microcasts, newsletters and bookshelves.</p>
<p>Do I use all of them? Of course, not. But the fact that one plan provides me so much over and above the basic blogging functionality is priceless for me.</p>
<h3 id="but-what-about-other-platforms">But what about other platforms?</h3>
<p>I have hopped through a lot more platforms than what I am proud of. So, I know what works, and doesn’t work for me. Let me be brief and focus only on what doesn’t work for me with the most frequently talked ones. I don’t want to consider the costing aspects — I can work a way to use them so that they cost effectively the same.</p>
<p>The below notes also give me a ready reference when I get lured by a new platform next time.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress</a> is too busy, too bloated for my liking. I don’t like the CMS. I don’t like the themes. For my style of blogging, frequent quick posts than scheduled thought-out essays, the options and features become a hinderance. I don’t want to think about the title or the tags or the categories or the url. Or excerpt. Sure, I can customise this system just to get it right. But I don’t know (neither do I like) <code>PHP</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> blog looks pretty. Polished. Majority of my posts aren’t that. And again, it bundles too many features that I just can’t connect with. I am not a media publishing house trying to build a business with my blog. I am a dumb person with very basic needs. No “audience”. No business.</p>
<p><a href="https://blot.im">Blot</a> is brilliant. Another of those services I have a lot of love for, driven also from my respect to David, the mind behind the service. A brilliant guy, just like his service. But my editing workflow is just not files driven. When I write, I don’t always do that in my text editor. I want a web editor. I want apps. And, having said that, I also want text editors. Not something that Blot supports currently. For some, that’s the ultimate selling point of the service. Not for me.</p>
<p>What about <a href="http://write.as/">Write.as</a>, the recent entrant? Well, I like the service. I like the simplicity of the editor (I wish Manton got inspired from this one). But it feels far too fragmented. Each feature is a different product. I had noted this recently about the service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I land on a page which is a blank one with a blinking cursor. Brilliant! But what next? There&rsquo;s nothing else if you don&rsquo;t know where to go. I can see my blog posts, edit them. Do you want the community? There is a different product. Pictures you say? That&rsquo;s another different product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The workflow is not natural to me. It is a nice, easy service. But it doesn’t work for me. Plus, it lacks the app support. Without mobile apps, I just can’t publish those quick notes anymore.</p>
<p>Of course, I could pick and choose, make multiple platforms host different types of posts for me. I have done that. But I have realised, after a lot of pain, that it’s another hurdle in my posting workflow. Any decision my mind is to make before publishing slows it down, killing my writing productivity completely.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it’s a wonderful time to be blogging again. There’s such a rich set of platforms that can suit every writer’s style. For me, though, Micro.blog works the best, and I am going to stick with it for now. Does that mean I will <em>never</em> consider new or even the above platforms? Well, knowing me, I can never say never.</p>

			 <p>Last week, my whole family, near and distant, got together for my cousin’s wedding, and it kept me completely exhausted throughout this week. The venue for the wedding was unfamiliar to me and I am never comfortable at such places. I can never settle into any routinue of sorts, messing up my eating and sleeping habits, and invariably my body. The journey with a train to and from the destination, though, was wonderful. I have always had a fascination for the train rides, especially ones overnight. To be a resident of a world on wheels for a few hours is welcome — it distances you from all your regular thoughts. Each station the train halts at exhibits a different personality, lays out its own unique beauty for the traveling strangers. The <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/02/05/a-morning-during.html">skies in the dawns remain beautiful</a>, the vacant stations late at nights are equally mesmerising.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All said, notwithstanding the tiredness the event left me with, the train ride gave me enough memories to remember the two nights of the journey by. The week also saw me complete another of my <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/categories/30-day/">#30day</a> challenges. I am proud of this one, I learned so much. And I might have continued the challenge if it wasn’t for the hectic week. I will not, however, take photo-a-day as a challenge now. I want to make it regular, part of my blogging habit.</p>
<p>What #30day challenge should I sign up for next, then? Anyway, last week was a slow writing week in terms of number of posts. But in terms of number of words, I wrote more than what’s usual for me.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Respected Mr. Gaitonde,</p>
<p>I have reached Tikwadi. As I had promised you in our last meeting when you had unnecessarily criticised me for the lack of seriousness, I have taken this job extremely seriously. Let me be extremely clear; your ultimatum that if I do not work sensibly very soon will lead to me losing my job had nothing to do with the deftness with which I have decided to travel.</p>
<p>Anyway, things are absolutely fine here in Tikwadi. There have been no untoward events until now. I think the villagers had unnecessarily raised an alarm. A day comes. The night follows. And days go by so without anything eventful happening. No murders, no aliens, no ghosts. Not that I am afraid of any of these. For that matter, I do not even believe in such laughable charades.</p>
<p>Overall, the town is beautiful. The people are also beautiful. Not the women &ndash; I mean, I am not saying the women are not beautiful. I mean, that does not matter to me. Undoubtedly, though, each one is uniquely crazy. Again, not that it matters much to me &ndash; I mean, the job matters to me. But the fact that the town is batshit crazy does not affect me.</p>
<p>I hope you know what I mean. I will report when something eventful happens. The people are waiting for me for a game of cricket. Football is with me.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity you gave me. Agent Raghu signing off.</p>
<hr>
<p>Dear Gaitonde,</p>
<p>Here I am, reporting to you again from Tikwadi. I will be very crisp this time, as you had said in your letter. I know I wrote numerous unnecessary things in my letter the last time. But my only intention was to let you know how normal the things were. There wasn’t any other hidden agenda. I won’t say your quip that “you are not on a picnic there” did not hurt me. It did … I mean just a bit. Not enough to impact my job. You can be assured about that.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the town does not seem as normal as I had reported the last time. There have been some sightings. Or so the crazy, frightened villagers say. I &ndash; let me assure you again &ndash; am not afraid at all. Just to be absolutely safe, I am just avoiding going to the areas from where the sightings have been reported. It is not because I am afraid. It is just to make sure you continue to get the reports from Tikwadi that you so dearly look out for. If something, anything, happens to me, I do not think it would be straightforward to find an equally qualified agent. I know you told me the last time to not call myself that. But this time it is not the post I am referring to. I use it as a common noun, and it is in that respect I call myself an agent. I am sure the kind heart of yours wouldn’t mind that.</p>
<p>Anyway, there is nothing to get very excited or scared about. Sure, the villagers are lunatic. I have no second thought in my mind about that. Furthermore, the town is not at all beautiful; it is miserable rather. The streetlights have no lights in them. The fans leak more noise than the air. Of course, both are true when there is electricity. Can you do something about these power cuts? I know I am an essential part of your team, and you respect me immensely. So, I am sure you would do that much for me. On a positive note, nature is, no doubt, beautiful. And some people are beautiful, beautiful as in not crazy. I only talk to these people regularly. I want to make sure I do not lose my smartness here.</p>
<p>Anyway, I will keep reporting if there are any more sightings or events. Gauri is calling me. She is beautiful. I mean, not that it matters to me.</p>
<p>Signing off. Raghu.</p>
<hr>
<p>Gaitonde,</p>
<p>I hate you. Why the bloody fuck did you send me to this idiot town. I am no agent. You should have told me that in extremely clear terms. “You are not an agent, but only our representative” is not clear enough. I checked the Webster dictionary; one of the synonyms of agents is “representative”, you moron.</p>
<p>I do not know if it is the town that makes people crazy here, or it is the people who make this town crazy. The dimwits continue to run at me wherever they see me with the reports of the sightings. Some see ghosts. Some see aliens. The idiots tell me the most terrifying tales and leave me alone. They do not even realise I need to live alone after they go.</p>
<p>There is nothing worth reporting from this windswept town. Have you ever seen a ghost, Gaitonde? I am sure you won’t know if you have; because they bloody look the same. The Gauri I mentioned in my last letter? They tell me there never was any Gauri in the town. I was naively planning to propose to her very soon; of course, once I complete this job for you. Now I don&rsquo;t even know who is real and who is ghostly. I keep getting slapped as I pull on their moustaches and their hair, just to confirm.</p>
<p>I am done being your agent. Call me back. If you can’t get electricity to this town, a request that you so mercilessly thwarted, at least get me a car.</p>
<p>Raghu</p>

			 <p>I replaced my glasses today after going through the tiring trouble of shopping for them. There is no other process for me that’s so meaningless. What’s the most important thing in a spectacle? The lenses. How much percentage of time do I spend on deciding on the lens? Not more than 5%.</p>
<p>And shopping for the eyeglass frame then is <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2018/10/07/131400.html">shopping</a> <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2019/10/05/234000.html">for fashion</a>, which I have no sense for. What I like, I am told, doesn’t look good on me. It’s either too big. Or too small. What I am told looks good, I am not comfortable wearing that. Tired, I purchase one from whatever remains. <em>What are clothes for if not just for covering my body</em>, my brain consoles my crying mind each time.</p>
<p>That’s how my shopping for a frame for my glasses goes. <em>What is the frame for if not just for holding the lenses within</em>.</p>

			 <p>I have released a new version of the <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/43">Paper theme</a> (v1.0.3) today to display category list on the archive page &ndash; this can be disabled via plug-in settings. The theme now also supports Reply by email and Conversation on M.b plug-ins by <a href="https://micro.blog/sod">@sod</a>. So if any of the plug-in is already installed, the appropriate link will be displayed under the posts. The upgrade also brings support to include <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/amitgawande">Buy Me a Coffee profile</a> in the social icons list.</p>
<p>I appreciate all the feedback I have received until now. With all the improvements, Paper has become my default theme for my blog (<em>what you see here</em>).</p>

			 <p>I have settled onto an easy workflow for publishing newsletters with Micro.blog. Another issue for <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/subscribe/">Excursions Weekly</a> went out today and the editing process was the most frictionless till date. I do wish though that there was an archive of the issues that I could share with the subscribers so that they know what they are signing up for.</p>
<p>Also, unfortunately the issue with the replies bouncing back has still not been fixed. Without that, I have no way to connect with the readers.</p>
<p>The way things stand, the support for newsletter in Micro.blog is extremely bare today. But the workflow remains one that I am most comfortable with. I just wish a few things were different and better.</p>

			 <p>I have been busy tinkering with many things these last few days. I don’t like when this happens because I halt everything else. I don’t read — that invariably leads to me writing less. My routine is completely messed up. <em>No early to bed and early to rise</em>. I stay awake unnecessarily, and when I eventually sleep, it is with a mind full of thoughts, working on stuff yet undone. No surprise, the sleep is not peaceful.</p>
<p>I cozy up to all the bad habits. No control on eating or control on my smartphone usage. Every good habit that was picked up is forgotten again. Yikes!</p>
<p>I find it curious that being productive mars my health more often. I need to learn to shut myself down on time. Learn to say no to additional work, notwithstanding the fun I am having.</p>

			 <p>I have released a new <strong>version 1.0.2</strong> of the <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/43">Paper theme</a> today, which addresses the reported issues and suggestions <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/01/23/paper-a-clean.html">since the first release yesterday</a>. Here are the changes, in brief.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support to include replies on individual posts</li>
<li>Added the configuration of social icons as plug-in setting</li>
<li>Updated the styling to display categories along with posts</li>
<li>Updated documentation to include installation steps</li>
<li>Fixed styling of images on smaller screens</li>
</ul>
<p>You can go to the Plug-ins section in Micro.blog and click “Upgrade” once the option is available. You will have to reconfigure (<em>for the last time, hopefully</em>) the social IDs in the settings of the plug-in. No need to modify the <code>config.json</code>, anymore. This also means the configurations will not be lost during the future upgrades.</p>
<p>I am thrilled with all the feedback that I have received. Paper is a beautifully designed theme, something I can take no credit for. At the same time, I am glad I could make it simpler for others to adopt it.</p>

			 <p>After playing around briefly to understand how to bring a theme made for Hugo to Micro.blog, I have finally ported one that I love. Today, I am ready to share it with the Micro.blog community. The theme is called <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/43">Paper</a> and goes with a tagline “simple, clean, flexible”. You can check for yourself in the screenshot below, or see it live at <a href="https://amit-test.micro.blog">my test blog</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I am a big fan of clean themes that are minimal, yet impressive. Paper is one such theme — I had used it earlier when I was hosting this blog with Hugo. Although it looks minimal, it isn’t so in the way it works. It has a simple, yet signature header, a built-in dark mode support with a beautiful toggle and a clean <em>black &amp; white</em> look.</p>
<p>I have added the first version of this theme to the plug-ins directory so that you can <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/43">install it directly as a plugin</a>. <del>It works with both Hugo versions that Micro.blog supports (0.54 and 0.91)</del> [<strong>Update</strong>]: An issue was reported while using the theme with Hugo version 0.54. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, until further update, the theme supports only version 0.91 of Hugo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. However, here are a few points to remember before you install the theme.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uninstall any theme that you have installed as a plugin. Set you current theme to blank and Hugo Version to 0.91 in the design section of your blog. Make sure there are no other conflicting custom CSS configured for the previous theme. Then install the Paper theme from the plugin directory. Once the theme is successfully installed, you can configure the social icons displayed in the header by modifying the available options in <code>config.json</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s already a brilliant selection of themes available for Micro.blog and I am excited to see the support grow further with every passing day. I hope you like this and a few folks benefit from it. If you do, I would love to hear from you.</p>

			 <p>After a phase of consistent writing, these are a silent few days. I have been busy a lot. Too many threads. Too many things at the top of my mind. Writing hasn’t slowed down, I am filling pages of my journal every day. But publishing has almost halted. Except for the <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/categories/30-day/">#30day</a> posts.</p>
<p>I love how when the mind gets bogged down with too many thoughts, spilling it all out onto a paper always helps declutter it. But, these are some of the rawest, most personal of the thoughts.

<p>Theoretically, hobbies should be among the most intrinsically motivated things we could do—they are the work we choose to do when we could be doing anything. But the validation we get from others online, and the validation we get from our culture writ large for spending our free time in a productive, virtuous way, muddies that motivation.</p>

			 <p>Everything, some might say. But such barbs might not help identify and address the core issue.</p>
<p>For the past few days, I have read a lot of posts where people describe why they are quitting social media — Facebook, Instagram, and the peskiest of all, Twitter; I empathise with the stories they are narrating. The wasted hours or the effects of doom-scrolling or an overall sense of negativity, helplessness. Colin Devroe <a href="http://cdevroe.com/2022/01/05/bye-social-media/">describes well</a> how these platforms have affected his ability to focus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]hen I’m still, when I’m idle, when I feel like I could be bored at any moment I grab my phone and scroll through Twitter which sends my mind into overdrive on a million topics, timelines, thoughts, and emotions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I get all of that. But my train of thoughts takes a slightly different turn, and I am left pondering what exactly do I find problematic about social media platforms.</p>
<p>Is it the timeline? If that’s the case, why is YouTube a concern? Is it the recommendations feed? If that’s the case, why is the chronological timeline on Twitter still pesky? Is it the trends? Well, why is the curated Instagram an issue? None of these is problematic in isolation. The effect that all of them put together have on me is the concern.</p>
<h3 id="passive-consumption-hurts-me-more">Passive consumption hurts me more</h3>
<p>I have realised that social media platforms lead users towards passive consumption. They benefit from their ability to make meaningless interactions pleasing. Or at least engaging. All the concerns I have stem from this “user-engagement-at-all-cost” business practice. Irrespective of how pleasing this interaction feels in the moment, it leaves me furious for the time wasted.</p>
<p>Twitter timeline is prone to do that. YouTube homepage does that, and so does their recommendation engine. Instagram, Facebook feeds do that. For me, even the Reddit forums tend to do that. Debatable, but <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2018/10/15/230500.html">Podcasts do that</a> too. And to top it all, my smartphone does this to the worst effect.</p>
<p>In short, meaningless interactions with any service or device is a problem. Passive consumption it leads to leaves me exhausted, feeling shit.</p>
<p>That is why a community like Micro.blog is not generally on such lists. The timeline component of Micro.blog, even though Manton has designed it to be different from Twitter and its ilk, is social media. But given the nature of the community, the interactions tend to inspire me to create, to act. Be opposite of passive. Even then, the timeline on my smartphone still causes me to waste time. It makes me pull down incessantly, subconsciously, and refresh. To check for more posts to interact with. <em>The pull-down-to-refresh has to be the most unhealthy use of our thumbs.</em></p>
<p>I had this issue identified some time back. It quit the social media that was useless to me, Facebook. I put control on those I use, Micro.blog and Twitter. It is their hunger to make me mindlessly scroll that I had to stifle. Most often, they do that via their apps on my smartphones. So, they don’t get space on my phone anymore. I access all the timelines on my computer. I follow the RSS feeds for many blogs to avoid visiting the timelines frequently.</p>
<h3 id="not-a-problem-for-all">Not a problem for all</h3>
<p>That said, I don’t judge others who continue to benefit from social media platforms. Get happiness out of using some or all of them. What’s hollow for me might be meaningful for them. This thought was one of the reasons I didn’t post when I quit social media for the first time. I wanted to avoid sounding preachy. Plus, the resolve to not use the platforms at all didn’t last for long anyway. I share the dilemma that Cheri puts down in <a href="https://hypertext.monster/2021/07/17/no-social-media.html">her brilliant essay</a> aptly named No Social Media Club.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My feelings are true to me, but I don’t want others to feel judged for what they choose to do. There was a time when our messier feelings were shared in certain contexts. At home. With family. With friends. With a therapist. Not online. Not like this. Not where someone who recently shared a donut photo might feel momentarily stung by my essay. You see my dilemma, no? What is currently truth for me might be a hurtful barb to someone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely. I am no one to judge other people’s choices. In response, they might judge me for such posts I write on my blog that I have no clue if anyone is reading at all. I have no likes or re-shares to show for them. I do this because I get clarity, happiness out of writing this, sharing this. As they say, you do you.</p>
<p>In short, in the strictest sense, I am not “quitting” social media. It’s not the platforms in themselves that I have a problem with. Any interaction that leads me to consume meaninglessly, passively or makes me feel shit is what I am quitting.</p>

			 <p>“Do what you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life,” goes a mantra for success – an adage that is unfortunately overrated, though. A person can’t always do what she loves to do. Rather, there are very few fortunate folks who do just what they want to do in their life. An extension to that adage is <em>love what you do</em>. Well, nor can one always love what she does. Rather, most folks hate what they do. They do it because they <em>have to</em> do it.</p>
<p>“Passion is the genesis of genius,” says Tony Robbins. Aha, that is precisely the reason we aren’t surrounded by geniuses. The majority of us are stuck doing something for which we have no passion.</p>
<p>That is such a cynical attitude, you say? Sure. But, it also is the reality of our world. Should we then give up? Far from that, actually. What one should do is to find out <em>why</em> they are doing what they are doing. For some, it might be the money. Or a sense of comfort. For many, it might be the best among the available options. Find peace with what you do. That is the first step to reach a phase in your life when you can do what you love to do.</p>
<p>There is also the fact that what you love can very well be temporary. It takes time to find your passion. What you think is your passion may very well be a fleeting interest. As Derek Sivers <a href="#">reminds us</a>, we can’t always depend on our current opinions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Our) former self is not always right. We shouldn’t preserve our first opinions as if they reflect our pure, untarnished, true nature. They’re often just the result of inexperience or a temporary phase. Old opinions shouldn’t define who we are in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the contentedness, though passing, that matters the most. Do what makes you feel contented, what gives you a good night’s sleep.</p>
<p>That said, there is, of course, another way. Stick to what you are passionate about. Switch paths when your passion changes. There will be hardships because doing what <em>you think</em> you love is not easy. But being satisfied never is. Be firm, stay strong.</p>
<p>So, which way do you prefer?</p>

			 <p>What is a productive day? Well, when it is closer to your bedtime, and you feel good inside for the day gone by, you have had a productive day. It doesn’t matter then how much you achieved in the day. Or how many of the planned tasks you ticked off. What matters is how the waking hours make you feel.</p>
<p>Plans are like the lane markings on the roads. It is beneficial to stick to them, follow guidelines around them. But often <em>to move ahead</em>, you have to put on the indicators and cross over such markers. You can’t let them become hinderances that slow you down, hold you back.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There’s no such thing as writing too much: your voice is important, your perspective is different, and you should put it out there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminded me of <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2018/02/13/215000.html">a post I had written</a> that shared a similar sentiment — we all can, and should, write. This particular passage that I had written, unfortunately, still holds true for many.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s saddening to see people resist the efforts to pen the words they think of. They go after what others have written, beautiful nevertheless, but at the cost of it being not real, fake. They underestimate the power of conveying one’s own feelings in whichever way possible. The words, their structure won’t matter much then. And that is one way one can start writing.</p>

			 <p>I recently changed the newsletter to a weekly digest instead of every long-form posts with Micro.blog. A fixed schedule is better for me than thinking about whether to include as part of the newsletter every time I post a post with a title. Until there is a better control (via categories) on what posts I can schedule for delivery, I want to avoid risking this particular setting.</p>
<p>That said, I didn’t really like the way the first digest looked. It was… mhmm … messy. Maybe a bit more control over the elements, like title etc. would be good. Without that, to make the digest look slightly better, here’s the custom CSS that I have added currently.</p>

<p><strong>Update [24 April 2022]</strong>: Fixed the issue with blockquotes being hidden due to the selection for headers being mistakenly applied to the blockquotes too. This uses the recently added CSS selectors for <code>.microblog_header</code> and <code>.microblog_footer</code>.</p>

			 <p>Today’s posts mark the completion of 30 days of daily posting on my blog. It wasn’t a planned challenge. But I wanted to attempt a routine, in public, of sorts. Prone to miss at least a day occasionally, a streak of any kind is always difficult for me. Plus, a good thing is that I didn’t have to schedule any posts just to make sure I don’t skip a day. I had written all the posts on the day they are visible on the blog. Well, in Indian Standard Time, that is. Even the long-form essays.</p>
<p>With post-a-day done, can I take up another 30-day challenge? I always wanted to post at least a picture every day. But, I am not too much into photography. Or rather, I am not good at it. Plus the worsening environment outside with Omicron in the air, it becomes a tad more difficult to find different places every day. What else?</p>

<p>Since my niece was born on this day three years ago today, the new year celebrations have been quite unfamiliar for us. The whole world celebrates along with us as she grows a year old, every year. Or so we have convinced her and her parents. This year is no different, albeit a tad muted. But still, the folks all-around plan to celebrate.</p>
<p>Knowing how all my plans for 2020 were mercilessly crushed by the pandemic, I had no expectations from 2021. I knew it was going to be more of the same dreadful cycle of panic, despair, and hope. At the same time, I also wished I and all my dear ones sail through, see the end of the year.</p>
<p>As I sit here today, looking at the year gone by, all I can do is smile. It began with a phase as dark as my family had ever seen. But it brought us all close, gave us the courage to stay strong. We got back on our feet, stronger. We learned to live with the virus, masked whenever outside. Vaccinating ourselves. Slowly, gradually, we wandered, unhesitant, outside our homes. Each one of us established our own new rules, routines, and traditions around travel.</p>
<p>We met our friends, got nostalgic for the days that we had left behind. We got hungry, got drunk and laughed our hearts out. I witness my office welcome my colleagues, the floors, and pantries reverberating with grumbles again.</p>
<p>I am fortunate I could do all of that. And a lot more. That I watch my crazy friends share their plans for celebrations with booze and snacks. That I would watch the skies light up with fireworks one more time. I am fortunate that I am about to get ready and join my family to celebrate my niece growing older by another year.</p>
<p>And if you are reading this, know that, in one way or the other, you are too. Just look back and find out why.</p>
<p>Resilience. And <em>kismet</em>. The two words I would remember 2021 by. Wish you a happy new year, you all!</p>

			 <p>It has been the third day in a row today that I decided to sleep early, get back to routine and failed. I just can’t stop myself from doing what I am doing at my system. Until last week, I used to lay down onto my bed with my Kindle and was sound sleep at the same time every time. That hasn’t been the case for this part few days.</p>
<p>I know what I need to do. I can’t make myself do it. Sure, I have my reasons why I am going late to bed. Nonetheless, I don’t like that a bit.</p>
<p>Sleep routine is a flaky thing — disturb it ever so slightly, and it absolutely falls apart. And takes down the whole next day with it.</p>

			 <p>I decided against <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/12/29/an-inner-monologue.html">replacing my theme</a> with something entirely new. I have too many custom components baked in currently that <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/09/09/interesting-but-i.html">I don’t have time</a> to replicate afresh. Plus, all the feedback from folks helped me convince myself that what I have is good enough.</p>
<p>But, I have refreshed a few aspects in the existing theme. As advised by Khalid, I started with a typeface and replaced it with a serif one. It looks a lot bolder to me. A few clean-ups around accent colours. And a lot of moving stuff around.</p>
<p>What I have, thus, is something that looks different, yet is the same. The journey is incomplete yet, there are many ugly corners that need clean-up. But I will get to those as time permits.</p>

			 <p>An inner monologue around my site’s theme to follow. I have grown bored by looking at my current theme. Not that I don&rsquo;t like it, it just needs a reset. This has been how the site looks for a couple of years now. It looks so bland. Not playful. Not <em>personal</em>. There is no character.</p>
<p>Over the year, I have added so much stuff to the theme. It does not, at all, resemble what I started with. It feels hacky all around. I have realised I can’t create anything polished, so I prefer not to build something totally custom. I prefer anything that comes ready-made. But that’s tricky as these are still early days for theming with Micro.blog. I like a couple, but neither is perfect. Shall I start with one and personalise in limit? Do I want to take the project up?</p>
<p>I know, I know. “It is the words that matter and not what’s around.” &amp; “Make the content beautiful, not the container” &amp; blah blah.</p>
<p>I get it. That’s the writer in me speaking. But <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/08/16/i-am-a.html">the developer in me</a> is craving for change. Can I hold him back?</p>

Simple, yet so poignant. I wish I could live my life being aware of this somewhere at the back of mind. It’s not the most efficient way to get the results every time. Being cognisant however that halting is an option always helps.</p>
<p>Our society does not look at “giving up” respectfully. Especially if one does so without being successful. But cashing out early, accepting the failure, is always a sensible option.</p>
<p>Giving up early is problematic. But hanging on just to delay the inevitable is foolish.</p>

			 <p>I love emails, sending and receiving them. In today’s world of social timelines where you shout into a void and expect an echo back, the medium of email feels a lot more personal. Drafting a long email to a friend today reminded me of the time when I wrote letters to my family, a few pages long. When we carefully selected and penned the words to convey the emotions we were living through. Physical letters were replaced by their digital form, the email, but the manner we communicated didn’t change.</p>
<p>With email, there’s no urgency, no pressure of read receipts and associated expectations for response. And when the response does arrive, there’s a feeling of connectedness. Instant messages, those words we spurt in burst, don’t exude that sense of affinity. A well-thought email does; it makes you mindful of the fact that someone cares.</p>
<p>One is a letter, another is messaging. It’s unfortunate that we have forgotten how to draft the former. I wish I knew more people who shared my liking for this medium.</p>

			 <p>Why is it so tiring to stay positive? Or to keep oneself motivated at times? It happens more so when I expect a lot in return from the time at hand. Why do I do that? <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/11/30/i-finished-reading.html">A reminder to self</a>. <em>Time is not something I have. Time is something I am.</em> Burdening it with unreasonable expectations is not fruitful. Anyway, there is no limit to our expectations from time.</p>
<p>If we manage to be productive for an hour, we still haven’t done enough as against what we would have in a couple of hours.</p>
<p>If we publish a post, we still haven’t participated in a social community we are part of. If we finish reading a book, we still haven’t read those newsletters or RSS feeds.</p>
<p>If we complete a task list at the office pending for weeks, we still haven’t spent enough time with our child. And the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>To everything that we do, there is always something we haven’t. Time is like a balancing scale. When balanced, more things are not on it than there are. To add anything to such a scale, we need to remove something first. The heavier the thing we put in, the more we extract.</p>
<p>We are balancing our time day in, day out. Acknowledging that we can’t do it all on a given day, we have to let a few things off our schedule for later. Why, then, ruin our days with something we didn’t do rather than celebrate it for something we did?</p>

			 <p>I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/12/10/after-a-welcome.html">recently cribbed</a> about how my smartphone was becoming the pesky little distractor again. I was planning to go back into a shell, keeping the device away from me for longer durations. However, I realised I may change the way and try being mindful this time.</p>
<p>I was hit by this thought during my guided meditation session today, when I came across this insightful observation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In trying to bend our will to that which is helpful, we strengthen our ego. In letting go of the things that are unhelpful, we free ourselves of our ego. Same intention. Different outcome.</p>
<p>We depend on our willpower to control our situation. We achieve the results but don’t train our minds. As a result, we harden our habits and behaviour. What if we change our approach. What if we acknowledge the unhealthy thought. But rather than becoming more rigid, we become softer. Rather than rejecting, resisting, we let go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting. I tend to depend on my willpower to not fall for the poor habits. That hasn’t worked well for me — I avoid the habits for some time, but soon am back to natural poor state. My problems with my smartphone are an example of this behaviour. So, why not accept that my device is a bugger? Be mindful of the fact that my subconscious reaches out for the device frequently. And when it does, acknowledge it and let it go.</p>
<p>Be mindful of the attraction, but not be burdened by willing self into resistance. Remind self of the negative outcome and detach. Can I train my mind to not fall for the attraction but ignore it naturally?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One approach is rigid, based on will, based on control. Other approach is based on awareness. Recognising the thoughts that are helpful and engaging with them. Recognising the thoughts that are unhelpful and letting them go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no idea if this would work for me. Who do I trust more, my willpower or my ability to be mindful? I have seen my willpower falter. Maybe I should give mindfulness a try this time. That’s what I have decided to do.</p>

			 <p>I love Pringles <em>crisps</em>. But the way they stack up, I could never eat them in a bunch — I feel guilty to eat more. As if I am emptying the can sooner and denying others of this wonderful cooked Potato. Fascinating how the container impacts your behaviour. Equally fascinating is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pringles#History">the history of this brand of snacks</a>. For example, the attempt was “to develop a new kind of potato chips to address consumer complaints about broken, greasy, and stale chips, as well as air in the bags”.</p>
<p>Well, chips haven’t changed much. And they didn’t even want to — as if they wanted to make the greasiness their identity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The product was originally known as Pringles Newfangled Potato Chips, but other snack manufacturers objected, saying Pringles failed to meet the definition of a potato &ldquo;chip&rdquo; since they were made from a potato-based dough rather than being sliced from potatoes like &ldquo;real&rdquo; potato chips.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the technicality aside (yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_paraboloid">the shape of the crisp</a> has a name), they just don’t taste like chips. They are different. And yet, “no one can eat just one”.</p>

			 <p>Sunday evening today was supposed to be a distraction-free, creative session with my tools. It was anything, but. Don’t you hate it when someone else’s plans become unplanned, unavoidable commitments for you? The price human pays for being a social animal 🤷🏽‍♂️</p>

			 <p>After a welcome phase of independence from my smartphone, I am back to fidgeting unnecessarily with the device. I keep it close to me when I shouldn’t. Notifications have started pestering me again. They hack my focus away. I know the reason, I have given up on my resolve to not hand over the control. It didn’t happen instantaneously. It happened gradually, over time. Now I feel the burning sensation like a slowly boiling frog.</p>
<p>There was a time when I used to go to any extends to stay away from the device. Keep it in the next room. No apps. No notifications. <em>Never</em> next to the bed. YouTube disabled. And on and on. Eventually, every time I picked it, a bulb lighted in my brain reminding me to not surrender.</p>
<p>And the pesky device conquered those defences one by one, without me realising. It started with a few apps. Then their notifications. Then a need to watch and share a YouTube video from the device. Before I realised, I was wishing good night to my phone lying in the bed.</p>
<p>Today, I was on my computer, the powerful personal computer which can cater to all my commands. But I reached out, as if out of habit, to the smartphone just to peek at those apps, the web versions of which I had just visited. I knew I was sick again.</p>
<p>My smartphone has become the most personal thing I own, but also the one I need to frequently stay away the farthest from.</p>

			 <p>As much as I love Ghost as a blogging platform, I hate maintaining an additional platform. I needed to keep it on because it provided a wonderful way to deliver newsletters as an extension to a regular blog. Another reason I used it was the editor — it is hands-down the best web editor interface out there. But, I never draft my newsletter posts directly in the web interface anymore. I use Ulysses for all forms of writing, and <em>I love it</em>.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/12/07/an-easy-upgrade.html">Micro.blog supporting the email newsletters</a>, I can <em>again</em> bring all my writing to a single place. That will be one less platform to manage and <em>to pay for</em>. So, the <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/subscribe/">Slanting Nib newsletter shifts to Micro.blog</a> now.</p>

			 <p>Assuming Manton is <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/12/04/putting-the-final.html">about to announce</a> some way of emailing posts or digest of post to the subscribers of Micro.blog hosted blogs, here’s how I wish it works. Email is just another cross-posting option. I know it’s tricky, and it will not work that way given Micro.blog, as timeline, also supports feeds from external blogging hosts. But here’s how I hope it works for it to be useful for me.</p>
<p>The writer selects a category (or a group of categories) for emailing. The posts she publishes under those categories are emailed to the subscribers. Subscribers decide whether they want an email for every post or for a digest of the posts (on a defined schedule — daily, weekly).</p>
<p>This would be a good start, everything else can come later. I have no idea if this is even a feature Manton is working on. But he says it’s “totally unique”. So, I am hoping it works very different from typical newsletter services.</p>

			 <p>I am back to using Mach3 by Gillette. Having tried everything, this razor still gives me the most comfortable shave. I don’t love money-hungry tactics of Gillette, but am glad they made this model.</p>
<p>There was a time when I used single blade safety razors. When Gillette launched the dual-blade razors. I thought <em>it’s double the blades, this has to be better</em>. It wasn’t. Later, I could finally <em>afford</em> Mac3, and I used it for the longest period of time. There was no need to shift, it suited me.</p>
<p>Then the craze for Indie, hip brands with products targeting “bros” engulfed India too. Search for a razor on Amazon and you will be bombarded with a slew of funnily named brands selling grooming products for mens. All claimed quality and affordability. Most targeted Gillette. Feeling burdened with guilt of not supporting newer brands, I switched. I started using a 5 blade razor from one such brand. And then kept hopping for a couple of years. Razor shopping soon became a hobby, and then slowly turned into a nightmare.</p>
<p>Eventually, I gave up and went back to Gillette. First to their pricey 5-blade razors and finally to Mach3. I realised something after this period. A razor with more blades doesn’t always mean better shave. <em>More doesn’t always mean better.</em></p>
<p>So in short, I am done feeling guilty for using a product from a brand that’s hated a lot. It works for me, so I use it.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54785515-four-thousand-weeks">Four Thousand Weeks</a>, a philosophical guide by Burkeman about time. This one is the best time management book that preaches one should not fret too much about managing time. Live life being aware of its finitude. Doesn’t matter how much we try, we can never master time. It reminds you throughout the book that you don’t <em>have</em> time, but time is what you <em>are</em>.</p>
<p>Just like Burkeman did with his previous book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13721709-the-antidote">The Antidote</a>, he left with so many profound observations and thoughts. This is not a practical guide of hacks that you could try to follow to improve your life. Rather, it lends an opportunity to reflect on at least a couple of ways you perceive the concept of time, and consequently, lead your life.</p>

			 <p>Every time the grinds of the daily life take toll over me, I travel to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabaleshwar">a place close by</a> with my family and friends. The last weekend was another such occasion.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I love this place not because it is a perfect family getaway (that it is), but because it is easy to travel to, and so there is not too much planning needed. Most trips get burdensome by the sheer pain of planning so much, so ahead of time. I enjoy the travels where that’s not the case, especially when I have no interest to be a typical tourist and go spot hunting.</p>
<p>The purpose of one’s visit is what matters at the end. If it is to find out everything of interest in a place, sure, go sign up for a hectic few days. Even I do that at times. But, why do that when irrespective of how much you roam around, you can never cover all the interesting places, anyway? The tourists flocking around an attraction kills it for me. It is just a place of business. I prefer the turn en route where no one halts. Or the point which hasn’t got any fancy name yet.</p>
<p>Anyway, I know every nook and corner of this resort I stayed in. My family and I have visited every spot of interest in the place, and so can selectively just visit those that <em>affect us</em>. We did just that this time, too. Maybe, I am different. I am glad that my family is just like me. Crazy different “tourists” that travel <em>for</em> the experience, not <em>with</em> a checklist!</p>
<p>Here are a couple of more pictures from the relaxing trip.</p>

			 <p>While on my morning walk today, I came across a kid who was cycling around our gated community. I see him every day, alone, free — every time I see him, I know he’s enjoying his cycling. Today at a turn, I saw him sitting on the ground, his tumbled cycle next to him. I could see a lady with headphones and a couple busy with their chatters pass by him. The kid was staring down, scratching his knee, focused within.</p>
<p>I felt he wasn’t looking at anything particular, but rather was sad. Maybe he did look at a few people, with expectations, as they passed him by earlier, wishing someone to help him pick his cycle up. Maybe he had his expectations from humanity broken.</p>
<p>Anyway, as I came close to him, I asked him he was fine. All it took was my first word, and he was up on his feet, trying to pick his cycle. Once he gave me his permission to touch his cycle, I helped him get it up on its wheels. He adjusted his tiny spectacles over his nose with his wrist, mumbled a few words and paddled along. I soon saw him chasing pigeons with his cycle, the birds not flying away but hopping around. It looked as if the friends often played this game. In my opinion, his tumble today was a test that we adults failed.</p>
<p>What have we become as a Soceity that we prefer to remain plugged in to our digital worlds, that we don’t even acknowledge a saddened kid who simply needs a nudge to get back to enjoying the realities of life?</p>

			 <p>I feel I have been struggling to find quiet time to read and write recently. I can blame it on many things, but I know within that I am to blame for this feeling. When I get time, I waste it. I convince myself that I need to relax first to get in the groove before I can write or read. I have been relaxing for a few weeks now, and it has only made me more tired.</p>
<p>This leaves me frustrated. Lazy consumption of other’s work is meaningless if it does not trigger any thought. I do that the most these days. I read, but I do not think. I write, but they are shallow thoughts. When do I spend time to churn a few ideas? To word them into something profound? You should write what feels right, I understand. But if it is only the deserts you chomp on, you won’t feel satiated after a point.</p>
<p>I need action, both to my mind and my body. Isn’t it curious that long phases of inactiveness can slowly wear them down? Both readily slide back to their lazy defaults. I need to be strong to push back and to make them move their asses.</p>
<p>Without that, what I have is a dull mind and a couch-clinging body.</p>

			 <p>Now that <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com/2021/11/19/113813.html?title=markdownInDrummer">Drummer supports Markdown</a>, I find it&rsquo;s a nice change overall. There are times when I invariably want the power of Markdown while writing some long posts. It&rsquo;s good that Drummer has that option now. I also like how Dave is implementing it &ndash; it&rsquo;s just a new node type. More I think about that, it feels very similar to WordPress' block-editor, but much better and simple. Even with this though, here&rsquo;s how I summarize my thought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not want to unnecessarily hamper the simplicity of posting with Drummer. That lack of complexity is this system&rsquo;s USP.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780446670111">Einstein&rsquo;s Dreams</a> by Alan Lightman today. This is a wonderful collection of thought experiments around our perception of time. The summary of the book says it&rsquo;s a collage of stories &ndash; but there aren&rsquo;t stories. With each &ldquo;story&rdquo;, the author <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8933.Alan_Lightman">Alan Lightman</a> instils a fascinating possibility for the concept of time being something uniquely different. What if everyone settles on their view of time? What if it is always in the past? Or always in the future? Or with just a day of life? It&rsquo;s a thought-provoking list.</p>
<p>All these 30 dreams are poetic vignettes that paint the varied interpretations of time. They evoke emotions through vivid narration of people&rsquo;s lives in such a world and their surroundings. I paused after each chapter, pondering over the impact existence of such realities could have.</p>
<p>At the surface, sure, these are just fictional stories. But dig deep, and you may be able to draw a parallel with realities of our world. With our perception of time. This is a beautifully written, short but profound read! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 📚</p>

			 <p>I finished listening to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37786022-storyworthy">Storyworthy by Matthew Dicks</a> and I instantly wanted to purchase the eBook version of the book too. This is one of those few books that are best read as both audio and text version. The audio brings out Matthew’s expertise as a storyteller — you realise how powerful the medium of storytelling is. However, <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com/2021/10/26/104336.html?title=audiobooksAndEbooks">as I had recently complained</a>, it doesn’t give me enough chance to make notes from. Or to go back to those key sections and read them again.</p>
<p>I am not a storyteller by profession. I don’t get on a stage to narrate a story from my life to a group of strangers. Rather, I can’t even do that if I wanted to — the introvert in me shudders even thinking about it. But I do like to tell stories to the people I am comfortable with. To my family, my friends, my colleagues. And what Matthew attempts to narrate in this book is how to do that better.</p>
<p>But it’s not the “how to tell better stories” part that I found helpful. It is how to find those story-worthy moments from your life that had me excited. Matthew has a very natural, effortless way of conveying the methodical ways to identify, prepare and tell your stories easily. You would expect that, he is a teacher first, after all.</p>
<p>At the same time, he is also a writer and a renowned storyteller, though. So, listening to him tell his stories and use them as a tool to teach the process behind was fascinating. He has mastered the art over his many shows, and he lays out everything he has learnt through his experience for his readers to benefit from. He holds back nothing.</p>
<p>I have made so many notes, and I will make a many more when I <em>read</em> this book a second time. One thing, I have got homework for life now. And I don’t complain.</p>
<p>You should read this book even if, like me, you have no intention ever to tell your stories to strangers. Because, as Matthew says, there come moments in our life when we do tell our stories. So, instead of being terrible at it, we can attempt to do slightly better. Maybe we will not bore a few people the next time we ramble along in front of them. A must-read for me. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t remember the last book before <a href="https://sive.rs/h">How to Live</a> by Derek Sivers that made me contemplate so many times while reading. The moment I was done with the last page, I had my diary out to capture my understanding from each of the 27 answers to that one principal question, <em>how should I live</em>.</p>
<p>As Derek says in the subtitle of the book, they are all conflicting answers. But the conclusion is not weird at all — for one, Derek is a masterful and a deep thinker. Each short chapter has most knowledge presented in the least number of words possible. Wisdom to words ratio is pretty high with this gem of a book.</p>
<p>At the surface, the book is pretty straightforward to read. Short chapters. Short, easy sentences. But, dig deep, and it is one of the most difficult books to fathom. It will force you to question what you have believed throughout your life, and it’s that questioning that will leave your mind unclouded.</p>
<p>It’s easy to write long, elaborate prose. But it takes time to shorten it, and I am glad Derek took that time. In his words, it took him four years, often writing 16 hours a day, to condense it down from the first draft of 1300 pages to 115.</p>
<p>What results is one of the most powerful and important books ever written. Take time and read it slowly. ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p>

			 <p>I enjoy writing posts in Drummer. One of the <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com/2021/10/21/163615.html?title=BenefitsofWritingwithDrummer">many reasons</a> for that is I can see all my posts in the same editing space. It is so easy to scroll through all your posts and find reference to just that one old post.</p>
<p>One thing that missing, though, was there was no easy way to get the <code>url</code> for that post right in Drummer. So, I got scripting. I have <a href="https://gist.github.com/am1t/c1a1d37af7cd33aedc9e1263888a70e0">created a script</a> which does just that. Select any node, run the script, and it will present the URL for that post in a dialog box. Here’s how you enable it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy the below Drummer script and paste it in your special <code>opml</code> file for <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml">Scripts menu</a> (File ⇾ Special files ⇾ Scripts menu…)</li>
<li>You will see a new entry in Scripts menu</li>
<li>Select any node, even the headline (a titled post), and select the newly added script menu item</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get the URL for the selected node.</p>

			 <p>I recently <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/10/12/of-course-i.html">started blogging with Drummer</a>, a new Outliner made public by Dave Winer. It has been a wonderful experience. I don’t know what it is about a single outline as a base for your blog, but it feels natural. I have been enjoying writing and playing around with <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com">my Drummer blog</a>. However, it is not easy to fathom the simplicity of the whole system just through words — only trying it out will make you appreciate the ease. I wanted to capture what it is and how to quickly get started with it for myself and others to follow.</p>
<p>Drummer documentation captures most of this information. But for someone, like me, who’s new to the concept of outliner, the whole stuff can be pretty overwhelming. So, here I capture what I learned and liked so that it helps other newbies like me.</p>
<h2 id="whats-an-outliner">What’s an Outliner?</h2>
<p>An outliner is basically an editor that can edit an outline. What is an outline, you ask? Well, outline is text items represented in a hierarchy, with each item having a parent (typically a title) or multiple sub-items (typically related points). There’s a lot more to know, but I am more focused on drawing a parallel with regular blogging terminologies.</p>
<p>You can think of a first parent item as a title of your post. Each sub-item that follows is like a new paragraph. You can further divide the items into sub-items, that’s grouping related points into a subtitle for example. The only difference is instead of it being represented as a header and list of paragraphs, it is a tree-structure of points, closely related and unrelated.</p>
<p>If a post doesn’t have any child, it’s a titleless post, a micro-post — something like a tweet.</p>
<p>Dave Winer is the strongest proponent of using the outlines as the base for the blogs, he uses them for his blog, <a href="http://scripting.com">Scripting News</a>. The basic hierarchical structure of an outline, makes using outliner for blogging powerful. Both the types of posts, long-form and micro, sit well together. After all, it’s just one long list of text items one after another. Whether they have a sub-item or not define how they get represented. Or that’s how Dave likes them represented.</p>
<p>Drummer is one such outliner that benefits from the years of Dave’s experience. He has understood all the nitty-gritty of blogging through this form. So, once you overcome the initial struggle of unknown, the experience is pretty smooth.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-a-blogging-cms">Is it a Blogging CMS?</h2>
<p>Not really, Drummer is just a web application that can edit outlines. These outlines are typically represented as an <code>OPML</code> file. Basically, all you do with Drummer is edit <code>OPML</code> files of different forms. It wraps a few special <code>OPML</code> files — mainly <code>blog.opml</code> — to give them specific meaning while using them as base for blogging.</p>
<p>But, all we do is edit these <code>OPML</code> files then, what builds the blog?</p>
<p>Well, the software that runs Dave’s blog does that job. It is called <a href="https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog">Old School</a> (because Dave believes this is the old school way of blogging) and is hosted by Dave. In a way, Old School is the blogging CMS and not Drummer.</p>
<p>So, from my understanding, the way the thing connect is as below.</p>
<ol>
<li>You sign in with your Twitter account and that creates the necessary backend — basically a S3 store for your OPML files — based on your Twitter username.</li>
<li>You create, view, edit the <code>OPML</code> files using Drummer. The special files like <code>blog.opml</code> and <code>about.opml</code> hold special meaning for Old School. (<strong>Update:</strong> In fact, <code>about.opml</code> is just used for representation. You can name it anything.) So, you update them and through a command in Drummer (Build my blog), you communicate to Old School server to refresh your blog.</li>
<li>Old School receives the communication and based on provided inputs, it identifies the files to use for building the blog. It reads the <code>OPML</code> files from the backend store for the files and converts them to static files that get served as your blog.</li>
<li>Old School also serves you blog at the <code>http://oldschool.scripting.com/&lt;your-user-name&gt;</code> URL. So in a way, you don’t need to host any additional software.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-do-i-get-started">How do I get started?</h2>
<p>Dave has a got a handy documentation in place that you can follow. I will point to the relevant parts in the documentation so that you can follow along and get started.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Main blog:</strong> Follow the <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628692121000">getting started guide</a> to get a blog up and running with Drummer. In short, create a <code>blog.opml</code> outline file. Make the outline public. And finally, build the blog using <code>Tools &gt; Build my blog...</code>. This should open a new tab with your blog rendered with Old School. You can customise your title and description of your blog and a few head-level attributes.</li>
<li><strong>Title and Description:</strong> Modify/add the head-level attributes <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> and rebuild your blog.</li>
<li><strong>Header Image:</strong> Add a head-level attribute <code>urlHeaderImage</code> pointing to the header image of your choice and rebuild your blog.</li>
<li><strong>Copyright:</strong> Add a head-level attribute <code>copyright</code> with the text you want to appear in the footer and rebuild your blog.</li>
<li><strong>About Page:</strong> If you want to create a new tab in your blog for <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1633177951000">your About page</a>, create a new <code>about.opml</code> outline file using Drummer, make the outline public, add a head-level attribute <code>urlAboutOpml</code> pointing to this public outline and build your blog again. (<strong>Update:</strong> In fact, <code>about.opml</code> is just used for representation. You can name it anything, as long as you configure the value for <code>urlAboutOpml</code> accordingly.)</li>
<li><strong>Link Blog:</strong> If the concept of linkblog excites you, you <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1633177803000">can use another software</a> by Dave, <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a>. Just add a new head-level attribute <code>urlLinkblogJson</code> pointing to your linkblog JSON file, which would look something like <code>http://radio3.io/users/&lt;your-user-name&gt;/linkblog.json</code>.</li>
<li><strong>TimeZone:</strong> To make sure the dates are rendered correctly on your blog, add a head-level attribute <code>timeZoneOffset</code> for the place where you would be blogging from. The value should be the offset from UTC — for example, <code>+5:30</code> for India or <code>-4</code> for New York.</li>
<li><strong>Creating Post:</strong> Head over to your <code>blog.opml</code> file in Drummer and click on the <strong>+</strong> icon (for New Note), write what you want to write and rebuild your blog. Your post should be up.</li>
<li><strong>Adding Links:</strong> Select the text to which you want to add a link, click on the “Link” icon (the second icon from top in the icon bar that sits on the left of the editing area) and insert the URL.</li>
<li><strong>Adding Images:</strong> This one’s slightly tricky. First, have your image hosted on some place where it would be accessible publicly. Get the URL to your image. While on the item you want to associate the image with, click on the “Edit attributes” icon (the third icon from top in the icon bar that sits on the left of the editing area). Now you can either create an inline image (with attribute <code>inlineImage</code>), right-margin image (with attribute <code>image</code>), title image (with attribute <code>metaImage</code>). I wish this work was simpler.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, you should have a well-configured blog up and running. Keep Drummer interface open in tab and keep adding entries. This method of updating your blog will soon grow on you.</p>
<h2 id="what-else-can-i-customise">What else can I customise?</h2>
<p>Even though you have all the basics covered till now, there is still a lot that you can and should do. But I would recommend get comfortable working Drummer and check for yourself if the workflow fits your routine and liking. If it doesn’t, these additional configurations are just a distraction.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you find out that you are enjoying this system of blogging, here are links to a few additional configurations that you can perform.</p>
<ul>
<li>Customise the styling using the custom templates <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628776805000">1</a>, <a href="http://ol.amitgawande.com/2021/10/13/170912.html?title=customTemplateWithDrummer">2</a></li>
<li>Build your blog <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628861390000">with one-click</a> using dedicated icon</li>
<li>Using Custom Domain for your blog. <a href="%20%20https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/#Using%20a%20custom%20domain%20with%20Drummer">PagePark</a>, <a href="https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/#Using%20a%20custom%20domain%20with%20Drummer">NGINX</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1629212543000">Create a Glossary</a> — a text replacement/substitution/expansion list</li>
<li><a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628781021000">Embed Tweet</a>. <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628781065000">Embed YouTube video</a>. <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628781273000">Emoji Short Codes</a>.</li>
<li>Enabling <a href="http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2021/10/15/203642.html?title=https">HTTPS for Drummer Blog</a> (evolving)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-few-additional-notes">A Few Additional Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li>There’s a Mac app (electron based) called <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml">Electric Drummer</a> that can act as an outliner. However, you should avoid using it for blogging if you intend to blog from multiple systems. Changes made through the app can overwrite ones as done on the web Drummer. So thread carefully.</li>
<li>Drummer is evolving. Dave is working hard to make sure all serious reported issues are resolved. Early adopters are trying out a hundred things independently. If that sounds fun, the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues">Drummer support issues page</a> is the place to go.</li>
<li>You can stay-to-date with all things Drummer by following <a href="http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/">this official blog</a>.</li>
<li>How does Drummer cost zero? <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/12.html#a114128">Dave answers</a>.</li>
<li>Why is Drummer, and other software from Dave, so tightly coupled with Twitter? <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/13/140500.html?title=whyWeUseTwitterIdentity">Dave answers</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>—</p>
<p>I intend to use Drummer as a place where I form my thoughts over the time. The ease of the updating process makes posting unformed thoughts a breeze. So, in a way, this space represents the most raw me. You can follow this me as he experiments with <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com">my Drummer blog</a>. And of course, there’s an <a href="http://ol.amitgawande.com/rss.xml">RSS feed</a>.</p>

			 <p><em>Don’t write for others, write for yourself.</em> Most long-time writers give this advice to someone who is just getting started. Actually, screw that. Every person who does any amount (and form) of writing gives this advice to every other person who wishes to do some form of writing.</p>
<p>Easy advice for others, but very difficult to follow oneself. To be frank, what does “not to write for others” even mean? Or write only for yourself?</p>
<p>I write when my mind blanks out. I write when my mind gets crowded. Most of the time, I write as I comment on something I read or listened to. At times, a thought makes me go, &ldquo;Hmm, that&rsquo;s curious. I should write more about it.&rdquo; Occasionally, I write because I want to force myself to write.</p>
<p>Writing something, anything, makes me focused. It calms me down. “I write because I have an innate need to write,” says Orhan Pamuk. More often than not, I share his sentiment.</p>
<p>But I am not perfect. I also write because I want others to read my writing. Trigger a conversation. Read what others think about my thoughts. As an introvert, that’s my only way to open up to others. I don’t care how many people read what I write. As long as I know that some do.</p>
<p>Numbers don’t matter to me. Conversations do.</p>
<p>On a philosophical level, everybody understands this belief of “not writing for others”. Write what your mind wants you to write, don’t write what others want you to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You write because your thoughts are important. You write because you are brave and willing to expose those thoughts. But, most importantly, you write because you have something to say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/live-your-life-on-purpose/why-do-we-write-89e56c069933">A fascinating perspective</a>. It is worded succinctly, but it still is philosophical. Everybody has something to say. But not everybody writes. So, what motivates you to put your thoughts in words?</p>

<p>I recently also stopped New Yorker which I may reconsider.</p>

			 <p>I spent a wonderful evening with close friends yesterday whom I met after a long period, some after more than 10 years. It’s remarkable how time can’t slacken some threads, lost possibly in the dull grinds of the life. You pick these threads from where you left them. As you remember the memories of yesteryears, you can laugh at them — or be affected by the updates from people that are not around you at this moment.</p>
<p>You know your bond with a few folks is strong when they can lend the present moment innate warmth. You feel a deep kinship, regardless of how much time has passed since you last met them. Yesterday evening was one such occasion, when we tickled many old memories and made a few new ones.</p>

<p>The break also made me realise that I have made a few new friends online, especially from the wonderful community at Micro.blog. I missed the interactions with these folks. Each one of them is a brilliant creator in his or her own way. Bloggers. Photographers. Writers. They all are natural. They all inspire me.</p>
<p>I feel at home here, feel am part of this community. Not a feeling many platforms online can cultivate within you. It’s wonderful to be back and read through the lively discussions. The growth hasn’t dented the warmth, something that is pretty palpable here.</p>

<p>I love writing emails, I wish I knew more folks who enjoy my enthusiasm for emails. But my process of doing so is simple. I use the email client to draft the email. If I ever want to get it reviewed from someone else, I will just mail them with the draft or temporarily share the device.</p>
<p>There’s another reason why I don’t use any text editors for emails. Because if I do, I will start writing in Markdown and eventually hate my email client for not growing up.</p>

			 <p>Why’s the colour of everything marked unisex so bland? Who decided that mens don’t like any colours other than black or grey or silver? Or who decided that women will only like pink or purple? Why can’t I go on to a street carrying any non-black coloured umbrella and not get stares that judge me?</p>
<p>Some might say it’s trivial, yet I find this behaviour extremely frustrating. We claim we are making progress on multiple levels, yet we continue to stick our age-old presumptions of choices among sexes. And you know what, I have a theory why the choices of colours specifically are advertised in a way they are.</p>
<p>Professional places are bland — colours aren’t professional. Life and playfulness is colourful. So, who do we see as a professional? Well, of course, men. And who’s all about play? Right? <em>Right?</em></p>
<p>Do you want to test this hypothesis? Here are Google Image searches for “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=man+with+umbrella">man with umbrella</a>” — how many blacks do you see there? Now, here’s the results' page for “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=woman+with+umbrella">woman with umbrella</a>”. Same question, how many blacks do you see there? Plus, what other commonality do you see among the images that are on the page? What’s the look that men are flaunting? And what about women? The industry is infuriating. Sigh!</p>

So, it was instinctive of me to purchase the book the moment I saw Derek announce it is launched. I had missed purchasing this when Derek shared a preview link — no idea why.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am excited to read this, both as a reader and as a writer.</p>

			 <p>The Atlantic is right, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/08/dead-internet-theory-wrong-but-feels-true/619937/">the Internet isn’t dead</a>. It is just crowded with more people who aren’t living — literally and metaphorically. There are still people active on the Internet, they will keep it thriving. Let the non-living bots crowd the space, take over the corners that have been deserted. The folks with life will keep the oasis of the Internet busy, colourful.</p>

			 <p>Some newsletters are just too long for my liking. I can read long ones if they are genuine essays, someone sharing what they are or have gone through. Some life experiences. Or something of interest for them. But when you curate, and still have hoards of links to some external content, I am not in. In short, long texts are fine for me. Not 100s of links.</p>
<p>When you say you curate, you should curate. Not include link to everything that you and your friends read.</p>

			 <p>Why’s there a fascination among the devs to <em>reinvent</em> the old tech that isn’t broken? Maybe the reason that the tech has stayed the same isn’t because no one attempted to change it. Can you fathom the possibility that the tech might be fine, as it is, to most common folks? Or perhaps it might not be one of those things that most give a hoot about? Yeah?</p>
<p>The two prime examples I see many developers take a go at are browsers and email. Please, both work fine as they are. Don’t try to reinvent them. They have reached a state in which they are open and standard enough already. Most people know the functionality they can expect while using it.</p>
<p>Stop reinventing it. Improve it, no doubt. Make it faster, simpler. Cleaner. But don’t <em>change</em> the definition of what that tech represents. Don’t mar the traits that make the tech great in the first place, universal accessibility.</p>
<p>Don’t attach a lot of muck around the fundamentals of the accepted tech and call it “2.0”. I will suggest call it “1.0” of whatever the heck you want to name it.</p>

			 <p>Kids are free, untouched by the necessities of the life. The concept of “necessary” doesn’t register itself with them.</p>
<p>For a kid, everything is necessary and, at the same time, nothing is. Is it necessary to eat? Sure, if he is hungry. Otherwise, it isn’t.</p>
<p>A kid does nothing because <em>it</em> is necessary to do it. He does it because <em>he</em> wants to do it.</p>
<p>In that sense, a kid always emphasises inwards, focuses on what is important to himself. As we grow, we forgot what matters. We emphasise what’s external.</p>
<p>The societal pressures. The fear of missing out. A kid knows none. <em>I like this</em> is all he cares about.</p>
<p>Listen to the kid in you, he sits closest to your heart. And if you can’t hear him, life’s going to a difficult journey, my friend. Be quick and wake up that kid within you.</p>

<p>I am certain it isn&rsquo;t for dummies neither does it claims to be so anywhere. It is for folks in a hurry, sure. I can&rsquo;t remember the last non-fiction book that read so easy for me.

<p>&ldquo;The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them. In other words, after the laws of physics, everything else is opinion,&rdquo; says Tyson. I have rarely heard someone be so calm, yet extremely badass at the same time.</p>

<p>Seth Godin <a href="https://seths.blog/2021/08/the-inevitable-decline-of-fully-open-platforms/">talking about</a> how open platforms are always in risk of becoming spammy and losing the trust of the users. I entirely agree — it’s a path that most platforms, open and closed, follow.</p>
<p>They enjoy the carefree attention from the excited early adopters who associate with the core values of the platform creators. But as the platform grows, it attracts users which would neither share the excitement nor the patience of the early adopters. They get noisy — they want to use the platform like their old one they are comfortable with. They <em>need</em> features that they are used to, not what the platform provides.</p>
<p>So, eventually, the tension that Seth refers to above gains prominence.</p>

I had <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2017/09/01/160500.html">published another in 2017</a>. Both the posts talk about a similar observation, about the constant fight between the coder and a writer in me. It reads in such a similar manner. The choice of words, the structure, the flow. It should be pretty apparent to anyone who reads it that both the posts come from the mind. From the same author.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, when I wrote the recent post, I had no clue that I had written about the same topic earlier some time. In a way, then, the adage that “there’s no original work being written, but just rewrites” is not that far off.</p>

			 <p>Now that <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/08/31/googles-inability-to.html">I think about it</a>, the overall messaging space is a mess and personally it’s a frustrating issue for me. We are so close, yet so far. Here’s what I want.</p>
<ol>
<li>A service for messaging folks, share text and images</li>
<li>A service for voice/video calls</li>
<li>A service that does both 1 and 2 with apps across platforms - mainly iOS, Android and Web</li>
</ol>
<p>This will allow me to not worry about device on which I am using it.</p>
<p>iMessage and FaceTime combination is brilliant, but Apple continues to see them as differentiators for its ecosystem. I don’t blame them — but it hurts me. I interact with only a handful of people that own an Apple device.</p>
<p>Google, well, decides to live in a fantasy world where there can exist no perfect messaging app. They get close to finding that right solution and throw it all away.</p>
<p>I had hopes from Microsoft. But for some reason they seem not to be interested in consumer space. Skype is ugly, its too bloated and the experience is terrible. It is not easy for families to join from.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, amidst all the mess, remains the only solution that does the required to any extend. It’s a terrible experience, but at least it works.</p>

			 <p>I see the dark mode is enabled for Micro.blog on the web. Nice to see the update <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> <a href="https://micro.blog/vincent">@vincent</a>. However, to my eyes, there&rsquo;s too much contrast with the choice of colors. For some reason, it strains my eyes. The changes are welcome, but felt this was a necessary feedback.</p>

			 <p>I came across <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/donelist">this suggestion from Oliver Burkeman</a> a few time in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if you worked on the basis that you began each day at zero balance, so that everything you accomplished – every task you got done, every tiny thing you did to address the world&rsquo;s troubles, or the needs of your household – put you ever further into the black?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, the idea is to keep a done list rather than a to-do list. I am absolutely certain that it benefits one&rsquo;s morale. I know that because I have been maintaining a form of done list &ndash; just that my method is different. For me, the two lists are complementary. I use a to-do list as a way to free my mind of the burden to remember things I need to do.</p>
<p>I do not set a target, an end date, for any of the tasks on the to-do list. So, they are not burdensome to me as my day begins. I look at the list, prioritize and just plan it through the day, if possible. A bullet journal helps me here - and also acts as a done-list. More the crosses on a page, more is the satisfaction.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading  <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781400064281">Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die</a> by Chip Heath. I wanted to love this book - the premise is brilliant. But it reads like a textbook, and that&rsquo;s no way to make a message stick with your readers. For that matter, that doesn&rsquo;t even look to be the author&rsquo;s intention.</p>
<p>To start with, the book lacks a clear, central idea that every chapter circles back to - it&rsquo;s all over the place. It digs into the history to find and describe every event, research or anecdote where a difficult message was conveyed effectively. Once it does that, the author summaries his understanding of why that worked.</p>
<p>First, the author nonchalantly tells you what the learning is &ndash; &ldquo;Which message do you think works best? Of course, second&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m sorry, but let the reader come to that conclusion. Don&rsquo;t beat him on the head till he gives up and agrees in frustration.</p>
<p>Second, each time the reasons that the message was effectively conveyed in each story are too varied &ndash; it references almost every phycological/managerial techniques - Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy and five whys and on &amp; on.</p>
<p>Finally, suggestions like be simple/concrete, don&rsquo;t bury the lead, capture attention etc are easier said that done. They are a set of skill that all understand they should have, but not every person has in equal doses. Please, your suggestion cannot be &ldquo;become a master public speaker or leader or designer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sigh, it was frustrating to read through this book. Ironically, it fails to follow the message it wishes to convey - talk about one message, be simple and concise. It would have stuck with me then. 📚</p>

			 <p>Is 21.5-inch non-retina iMac still a good option to consider? What about 24-inch M1-based iMac? The way things stand I&rsquo;m seriously considering buying an iMac - I don&rsquo;t want anything portable. I wonder if the transition phase we are currently in makes this an untimely purchase.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These methods of archiving are either imperfect, impractical, or both—and besides, even if I went through with them, chances are that decades from now, I’d just end up with a monster text file or a long-obsolete hard drive that would be a pain to sync up with some future listening platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I lost my music collection some 7 years back and I never attempted to build a personal music library since then. I have accepted the fact that the benefits of streaming services (mainly around discovery) are more valuable to me than my quest for a personal collection of my favorite songs. Unfortunate, but practical.</p>

			 <p>I am wary of using any Apple services as my default - they make it very difficult to use them outside of their ecosystem. I do not use only Apple devices. There was a time when I did. And then things slowly changed.</p>
<p>I use Windows at work. I use Android and iOS. I use iPad. Apple services rarely work well across all the platforms. <em>Just access then on web</em> is not an answer am comfortable with.</p>
<p>So as much as I dislike it, I am slowly using more and more services from Google and Microsoft. Surprisingly, Microsoft does well to fill the void between Android and iOS platforms with apps that work well on both platforms backed by Microsoft services.</p>
<p>I find it crazy that neither Google nor Apple are keen to address this key problem.</p>

			 <p>OnePlus completely messed up my upgrade plans with its product launches this year.</p>
<p>I have been pleased with my OnePlus 7, it has worked brilliantly for the past two years. For that matter, the phone continues to work well for me. It hasn&rsquo;t slowed down. Battery still lasts me throughout the day. I just wish for better cameras now.</p>
<p>I had made my mind that my next phone was going to be the pro variant of next OnePlus. But somehow the company has managed to screw up its most valuable brand.</p>
<p>First, they priced the devices far too high this year. In itself, it&rsquo;s OK if you can match the offerings of the other flagship brands - mainly Apple and Samsung - beyond the device. OnePlus still has some work to do to reach that state.</p>
<p>Then, after unnecessary hype, they launched a product which has been <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/search/query?q=oneplus&amp;wm=false">marred by coverage</a> that they could very well have avoided. They mindlessly under-spec&rsquo;d the non-pro variant of the device. The pro variant is facing the outcome of overpromising and then deliver just on expected lines.</p>
<p>I could still decide to ignore the negative coverage and go ahead with the Pro variant. The reviews haven&rsquo;t been too bad, and I know what I can expect from a OnePlus device now. But I wish the company did not make the decision so difficult for me. I had just started warming up to the Android platform and its benefits.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time">Make Time: How to Focus on What Matters Every Day</a> today. I cannot apply all the suggestions that the authors have to offer. But it&rsquo;s a fascinating list of a few easy to follow tactics, presented in a no-nonsense manner. The authors stay to the point; they don&rsquo;t ramble along as many authors of the self-help books tend to do.</p>
<p>I did find a few of the suggestions pretty useful and have already incorporated a couple. I can clearly see the benefit. What helped is that the authors worked in an industry and in roles that I can closely associate with. So, I could relate to many of the problems they talked about and was keen to hear what changes worked for them.</p>
<p>If you are at a full-time job and are struggling to get the right balance between work and life, this book would have a few strategies that you might find useful. 📚</p>

			 <p>I have been reading many books from Christie recently. Every time I get into a reading lull, I pick up a Poirot mystery and start reading. I was facing one such lull and Dame Agatha was to the rescue again. Her books always help me get back to reading more.</p>
<p>Anyway, after I read another of her wonderfully crafted mysteries &ndash; <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215492.Lord_Edgware_Dies">Lord Edgware Dies</a> &ndash; I wondered why are these books not generally adapted to TV series and films. Most of her books are perfect. Yet, we hardly see any adaptations. Is it due to licensing?</p>
<p>Anyway, the one attempt I had seen recently was the disappointing <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/murder_on_the_orient_express_2017">Murder on the Orient Express</a> from 2017. It was unnecessarily stylized, the adaptations need to let the story take over. The complex simplicity is the most important virtue of the Christie&rsquo;s stories. Then there is the old, yet long-running, TV series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094525/">Poirot</a> &ndash; again, enjoyable in parts but tries too hard. That said, I have liked whatever I have managed to see (mostly on YouTube).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much scope for something in the middle, not too stylized and yet, a modern adaptation. Preferably in the form of a film or a TV mini-series. I did come across one such adaptation, the 2015 three episode television <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Then_There_Were_None_(TV_series)">mini-series of And Then There Were None</a>. IMDB Plus has made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nh56fQe-zk">all the episodes available on YouTube</a>. I enjoyed this particular form. I felt it worked.</p>
<p>So sad that there isn&rsquo;t much readily available.</p>

			 <p>It was a couple of years ago when I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2019/03/25/213000.html">had ranted</a> about how the alternatives to the popular social networks are not seriously considered. A discussion something on these lines.</p>

<p>What all alternatives have you tried? Were there none that were good? If so, why? What is missing? How can they be made better? What is it that you are looking for in a social network?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so frustrating to see the state hardly change. A call to <em>tell the makers of the service why you cannot use their service</em> is rarely answered. Sure, new social networks are launched, but they have the same underlying problems. They create unnecessary flutter and eventually die down. Why not create buzz for something that&rsquo;s not aiming simply for the acquisition?</p>

			 <p>My daughter has been reading short storybooks since she was 5. She likes to read &ndash; she would find a comfortable corner for herself and start reading her books. I was a bit cautious introducing her to a full-length novel, though. I didn&rsquo;t want to dampen her interest in reading by the usual wordiness of the novels.</p>
<p>But recently, she asked me for some big books &ndash; &ldquo;I am bored with these small stories,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<em>I know them by heart now.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, I did give her a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27558257-magic-of-the-lost-temple">couple of</a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6310.Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory">&ldquo;big&rdquo; books</a> last week, and she hardly goes anywhere without her book since then. She carries a pencil and an eraser, underlines words she doesn&rsquo;t understand well, bookmarks pages. Ah, I&rsquo;m so happy to see her so engrossed while reading. I wish I had started reading sooner; I&rsquo;m delighted to see my daughter has.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Oh, recently I have seen another habit of hers. She likes to copy small stories into her notebook, then read them in her handwriting and out loud in her voice. Yay!</p>
<p>I wish she keeps her interest in reading intact as she grows and would assist her in whichever way possible. To start with though, I need to choose the right books.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16366.Endless_Night">Endless Night by Agatha Christie</a> and am not at all impressed. This review might contain spoilers, but I can&rsquo;t help I have to rant.</p>
<p>Nah, I am not letting the ending influence the overall rating for the book again. It is easy to get wowed by the intelligent ending and rate this book highly. But it wasn&rsquo;t a good read for me.</p>
<p>Right from the start, I didn&rsquo;t trust the narrator. I guess I&rsquo;ve been fooled by many first-person narrations for my liking. Michael is a poor narrator - not sure if it was intentional on Christie&rsquo;s part. None of his actions, his reactions made sense to me, further heightening my suspicions about what I was being told by him. So the twist towards the end fell flat - it was as if I already knew deep down and was just waiting for it to be revealed.</p>
<p>Oh, and I was waiting a lot of time throughout the book. 2/3rds in and there is hardly anything that takes place. To me, the love story between Mike and Ellie was not interesting. The way it played out was dull. It got tiring at one point to read Mike <em>tell</em> what was happening. The suspense around Gipsy&rsquo;s Acre wasn&rsquo;t built at all. It was supposed to be a &ldquo;gothic story with gypsy&rsquo;s warnings&rdquo; - wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>This may have been a brilliant psychological thriller for its time. But a lot has happened since 1967 and too many have been inspired by the style of surpriseful narration from this mystery master for this style to create the necessary impression anymore. This read was so unlike any other from Agatha Christie and this time it is not in positive sense.</p>

			 <p>I have a pretty common first name (or given name as it is called at some places). It&rsquo;s so common that even the movie characters with my name have rarely had any significant part to play. I believed my surname was uncommon, making the combination unique. But I was wrong with my assumption &ndash; boy there are so many Amit Gawande&rsquo;s out there on Facebook, the &ldquo;universal phonebook&rdquo;. <em>Yo namesake morons, why are you still using that app?</em></p>
<p>The names from European countries always fascinate me <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Every name sounds so unique. And has such a complex tone to it &ndash; it&rsquo;s new every time I hear it. And if I think I&rsquo;ve already heard it, they adorn the spelling with an extra &ldquo;z&rdquo;. Fantastic!</p>
<p>Having a common first name sucks. Having it end with an equally common surname sucks more. Good luck getting high up the search results list <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. I dread creating my account on any new service that is launched. I rarely get a username with just my first name &ndash; there is already a developer building that bloody service. With surname? Nah. With the first letter of surname? Nah. With a number or underscore in there? Yep, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that&rsquo;s what<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you get<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>That also the reason why I respect <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the service<!-- raw HTML omitted --> where I could get that username with just my first name. Uhm!</p>
<p>Of course, if your aim in life is just to get lost in the crowd, be not know or just be, have a common name. But who wants that? <em>Right? RIGHT?</em></p>

<p>This one had a pretty interesting storyline with lots of twists and red herring peppered across the chapters. Having said that, I wish the writing in the middle third was a lot more crisp. It gets too simplistic, slips into a narrative style of <em>telling</em> what&rsquo;s playing out. I would have lost the patience, but it was the rapid pacing of the plot that kept me going. Also it has a few subplots and characters that should have been edited out - it becomes tiresome to follow towards the end.</p>
<p>With all said, this is a promising debut nonetheless by Raman with a welcome, quick read with an Indian setting.</p>

			 <p>I was fascinated to learn about the so called town under one roof - Whittier. It has to be one of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/heres-what-its-like-to-visit-whittier-alaska-the-town-under-one-roof/slidelist/51542206.cms">the most isolated places</a> <em>which people call home</em>. I have so many questions about how the residents of this town <em>make</em> this place a home, how the isolation, the sameness affects them. It mustn&rsquo;t be easy.</p>
<p>I was mesmerized by this how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLnEHiIMohM">Michael Stevens describes</a> what the town must represent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The earth around Whittier is not always a friendly place. But so long as people call it home, Whittier stands as a magnificent gesture of defiance. Of human engineering. And the strength of inertia, of our desire to stay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more I think about it, maybe the life of us city dwellers is no less isolated than the residents of Whittier. Sure, they are stuck in one same building, surrounded on all sides by rocks. But so are we - if not physically, mentally we have caged ourselves.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2020/11/05/few-improvements-to.html">Feature Requests for Micro.blog Hosting</a></h1>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve got a few minor (?) feature requests for Micro.blog hosting based on my limited experience with the service. I think these features will further heighten and simplify the experience.</p>
<ol>
<li>I wish the edit buttons were available on the posts in the timeline, for example, right next to the remove option.  The availability of the remove option makes me believe the context is already available. Also, I understand an option to edit the original posts from blogs not hosted by Micro.blog might be tricky, but I hope Manton finds some simple solution, as he usually does.</li>
<li>I believe the edit for the replies is far simpler in comparison and should really avoid all the hoops one has to go through today, just for minor fixes.</li>
<li>Just the way, the whole site can be archived to GitHub automatically, I wish the custom theme can be too. It would help to track all the changes being made to the site design. Without the option, I need to manually set up and check-in the changes to the repository. And given how easy it is to update the custom theme from the browser, it just feels natural to allow backing up the theme as a git repository.</li>
<li>Currently, the spell checks and Grammarly plugin does not work in the post drafting <code>textarea</code>. I am not yet sure why, but it makes the posts very prone to errors.</li>
<li>This is way down the list (literally), but I wish the drafts are auto-saved while composing longer posts. I do not want to lose a draft just because I closed a window by mistake.</li>
</ol>
<p>Possibly these items are already on Manton&rsquo;s backlog list but just aren&rsquo;t prioritized. In which case, here&rsquo;s an added vote for these features.</p>

			 <p>With the way IPL has played out this year, I&rsquo;m sure the mood in many teams room is a tad dreary. Many performances picked up late causing reshuffle of the points table towards the later half. Though only Mumbai Indians have been consistent, I hope we get a new champion.</p>

			 <p>I came across this <a href="https://www.baty.net/2017/wordpress-is-a-typewriter/">opinion from Jack Baty</a> about static sites and I completely agree with him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[P]ublishing a static site is like sending a document to a printer. I have to make sure everything is connected, that there’s paper in the machine, and then wait for the job to finish before seeing the output. If something needs editing, and something always needs editing, the whole process starts over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a time when I enjoyed building my site with Hugo, but I never got comfortable with the writing flow then. Once I got tired and moved away, I&rsquo;d made up my mind that I won&rsquo;t ever sign up for a static site for my blog again. I firmly believe that blogs aren&rsquo;t the right candidates for static site generators.</p>
<p>Blogging platforms need to be light, free - something that static site generators, with the way they are setup, can never be. Jack&rsquo;s got just the right metaphor to express my thoughts. Writing <em>does</em> feel like priting a document with static sites.</p>

			 <p>I really enjoyed Aaron Sorkin&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_trial_of_the_chicago_7">The Trial of the Chicago 7</a> - it was an absorbing account of an event I didn&rsquo;t have much information about. I usually like the well-made courtroom dramas and this one was no different. And I also usually <em>love</em> Sorkin&rsquo;s method of telling stories and, again, this one was no different.</p>
<p>Though debatable, Sorkin is a master of narrating true stories, keeping you glued to the screen as he unravels more details about the story. He has also mastered his signature style to blend varying and often opposing, narratives and perspectives without letting the drama drag any moment. Even though I didn&rsquo;t know much about the event, I was completely involved and moved at many moments.</p>
<p>Also, as I was watching the trial play out, I thought Sorkin must have taken a lot of liberty in presenting the facts &ndash; especially the actions of Judge Hoffman. <em>No human can be such an asshole</em>, I thought. So the first thing I did was to check how closely were the event and the trial presented. I was surprised to find that most of <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2020/10/trial-chicago-seven-aaron-sorkin-accuracy-netflix.html">the key moments shown were true</a> &ndash; even the judge&rsquo;s behaviour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As unbelievable as it seems, Judge Hoffman, born in 1895, really did act with the malice shown in the film, dismissing objections from the defense before they were made and arbitrarily excluding evidence, witnesses, and even jurors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Horrible!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The lady on the microphone announced in her squeaky voice, &ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Mumbai airport.&rdquo; Oas groaned, closed his eyes, and contorted his face like only an exasperated 75-year-old can. Having heard her numerous times in the last couple of hours, he was tired of listening to her any more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she think I&rsquo;ve never been to an airport before?&rdquo; he muttered under his breath. &ldquo;Bah. I&rsquo;ve been on planes for longer than she&rsquo;s been on earth!&rdquo; The staff was running helter-skelter on the airport with some angst that Oas couldn&rsquo;t fathom. &ldquo;<em>Freaks</em>,&rdquo; he sighed in disappointment.</p>
<p>The constant low hum of the music from the headphones of the young guy beside Oas didn&rsquo;t help his mood either. As the guy shuffled in his seat, the huge laptop on his lap brushed against Oas&rsquo;s arm again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want my lap too?&rdquo; Oas blurted out loudly as he knew the guy couldn&rsquo;t hear him. &ldquo;Take it, I am happy to help you save the world which is what I assume you must be doing,&rdquo; he continued muttering. The guy hardly budged.</p>
<p>Bored of the one-way conversation, Oas got up and stood gawking at the hustle-bustle around. He was a lost alien amidst the time-poor professionals. He walked to a television screen in the lounge playing CNN. A news scroll read about a novel disease spreading through China. The main news being run on the channel though was about a kid at the Mumbai airport traveling alone. Oas massaged his forehead in disdain, wondered why this was news, and walked away.</p>
<p>He began to stroll around the airport. He had to buy nothing, but he also dearly wanted to interact with another human being. He wandered through the Crosswords bookstore, hoping a salesperson would ask him if he needed any help. No one did. Lacking the patience to browse around the towering walls of disparate books, he walked straight to the bestseller section. He glanced at all the self-help books crowding the non-fiction racks. The fiction ones were full of tales from fantasy
worlds. Oas was fond of neither; so he strolled out. </p>
<p>He saw a deserted coffee stall. Hoping that the person selling coffee would be as bored as he was, Oas walked to him. The person was seated on a low stool chair; to Oas&rsquo;s disappointment, even he was lost in his smartphone&rsquo;s screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s hot?&rdquo; Oas asked the guy with a wish it would trigger some small talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We only sell coffee here,&rdquo; responded the guy without glancing away from the glowing screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you serve it hot?&rdquo; Oas quipped.</p>
<p>The guy hadn&rsquo;t looked at Oas yet; he didn&rsquo;t even now. He jerked his face towards the coffee vending machine and said, &ldquo;We serve it however this machine dispenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With all his hopes for even a meaningless interaction crushed, Oas ordered a cup. The guy shrugged in annoyance, got up and walked to the machine. He served the coffee with eyes as dull as sloth&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Sorry to put you through so much trouble, my friend,&rdquo; mocked Oas. The sarcasm in his voice was lost on the mindless guy. He responded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a bitter taste in his mouth, Oas walked back to the gate buzzing now with the regular pre-boarding bustle. A lot of people had gotten up in the anticipation that the queuing would start soon. &ldquo;<em>Would they prefer to stand up longer just to be ahead in the boarding queue?&quot;</em> Oas wondered. <em>&ldquo;Just so that they could sit inside the plane longer?&quot;</em> The rationality behind the thought had always stumped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Puri?&rdquo; Oas heard a soft voice calling for him. He turned to face a flight attendant, smiling a very plastic smile at him.  The nametag on her read &lsquo;Anjali&rsquo;. Oas stopped himself from telling her that she had unnecessarily puffed her face with makeup. She had helped Oas earlier at the check-in counter; he had stopped himself even then. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you please follow me?&rdquo; It sounded more like a command to Oas than a request.</p>
<p>He looked at her, puzzled. He couldn&rsquo;t think of any reason why he should follow her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok, Anjali,&rdquo; he said curtly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need any help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, we have a priority boarding policy for all the senior citizens,&rdquo; she spoke without letting her two pepper-red lips touch one another for long. &ldquo;We will get you on the plane first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oas stared at her like a child would at his examiner. <em>&ldquo;Why does the world make us elders feel a lot more helpless than we are?&quot;</em> He didn&rsquo;t have much choice though; the stewardess looked adamant. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine. But I would need to be taken care of. I don&rsquo;t want to get stuffed in and forgotten,&rdquo; instructed Oas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t happen, sir.&rdquo; The plastic smile didn&rsquo;t leave Anjali&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Oas followed her. He was stuffed into the plane. And forgotten.</p>
<hr>
<p>Oas looked at the kid from the CNN news report boarding along with Anjali. He wished the kid wasn&rsquo;t sitting anywhere close to him. Sure, Oas was yearning for interaction with another human being, but he was convinced that kids didn&rsquo;t fit that category. He did not hate them. He just believed they were dispatched by God to make people live through misery right on earth for the sins they have committed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kids are too clumsy,&rdquo; he used to tell his wife, Sara, &ldquo;and too stupid to spend any time with. All they can do is leave you more frustrated than you were before.&rdquo; Sara, on the other hand, believed they were godsent to spread joy amongst the grieving souls, to teach them valuable lessons about life. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why God sent us no child. We are not grieving, you see.&rdquo; She used to joke with tears soon shimmering in her eyes. Oas let her settle with her fantasy.</p>
<p>Oas saw the kid follow Anjali till they reached right next to where he was seated. She started pushing the kid&rsquo;s backpack inside the overhead compartment. Oas dropped his face in his palm; the kid saw him do that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avik, this is your seat, right next to nice Mr Puri here,&rdquo; introduced Anjali. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you would enjoy your flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oas saw the kid slide onto the seat next to him and blurt, &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Avik shuffled into his seat by the aisle. He looked towards the open overhead compartment. Then he stuck his neck out into the empty aisle. He wanted to see someone around; he didn&rsquo;t. Displeasure cloaked his innocent face. He then looked at Oas who had picked up a magazine and was clearly pretending to be engrossed in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you reading, Mr Puri?&rdquo; Avik was looking curiously at Oas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that will interest you,&rdquo; Oas answered curtly without looking at him once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you like reading Mr Puri,&rdquo; continued Avik. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look too interested in that book. My mum says if you enjoy doing something, you are always very busy doing it. So much that you won&rsquo;t even answer a question from someone else.&rdquo; Avik had pulled out the envelope kept in the seatback pocket and rummaged through what was inside. &ldquo;I never answer my mum when I am watching cartoons, you know, because I looooveee cartoons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Avik was doing nothing to thwart Oas&rsquo;s beliefs about kids, rather, he was only making them firmer. &ldquo;Why are you alone, kid? Why are you not with your mum?&rdquo; Oas asked while putting the magazine back into the envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in Bangalore. My father is also in Bangalore,&rdquo; said Avik while pulling out the printed safety instruction manual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are <em>you</em> not with your mum?&rdquo; Oas asked again, thinking, &ldquo;of course <em>kids never answer the question that&rsquo;s asked&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they are not in Mumbai?&rdquo; Avik shook his head a couple of times and continued staring at the pictures in the security manual. &ldquo;I was living with my grandma here. She is very old &ndash;&rdquo; Avik paused and looked at Oas&rsquo;s face again. &ldquo;Not as old as you, though. But she still says she can&rsquo;t fly; she says she is afraid.&rdquo; Avik wasn&rsquo;t accustomed to staying silent. &ldquo;I am not afraid at all. My mum says I am very strong.&rdquo; Oas himself had started rummaging through the envelope now, searching for
headphones that he could plug his ears with. &ldquo;She says I am stronger than all my friends in the school. Rohit, Sid, everyone. Neil does beat me sometimes, but I always hit him back. My mum says I am stronger than even my father. My father -&rdquo; Oas had found the headphones and had quickly plugged his ears shut. He looked at Avik; he could see his lips
move, but heard no sound at all. He breathed a sigh of relief. He was happy that he had booked a first-class ticket; at least they provided the customers noise-cancelling headphones.</p>
<p>Oas saw Anjali standing by the gate welcoming the other passengers that were boarding the flight now. He watched a couple enter the flight with a baby. The father was walking in front carrying all the luggage. The new-mom was struggling to carry the baby through the narrow aisle without letting even its sock touch anybody around. <em>&ldquo;That kid&rsquo;s going to wail throughout the flight now.&quot;</em> Oas let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>The guy with the huge laptop under his arm and headphones over his head walked in next. Oas smirked looking at him. &ldquo;The Avenger,&rdquo; he muttered and chuckled at his joke.</p>
<p>Oas felt a pat on his arm; Avik was gesturing at him to remove his headphones. Oas didn&rsquo;t want to, but Avik had shifted his attention to work the seat belt that was holding him in his place. Worried the kid would set himself free, he pulled them away and gave Avik a probing look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what I was saying, Mr Puri?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t. You see &hellip;&rdquo; Oas pointed at his headphones. &ldquo;&hellip; I was listening to music. Now that is something I like doing, kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you keep calling me &lsquo;kid&rsquo;? Everyone else calls me &lsquo;Avik&rsquo;. My mum says she spent many days thinking before she settled on that name. You know what it means?&rdquo; Without waiting for Oas to speak a word, he bent his arms, flexing his biceps. &ldquo;It means brave, just who I am, my mum says. But she always cries when she says that, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last statement made Oas freeze in his place. He saw a moving image flash in front of his eyes; of Sara hunched down next to Oas, laughing and crying at the same time. <em>&ldquo;Oh, I know you are brave, Oas!&quot;</em> He could recall Sara lying to him, preparing him for something he just wasn&rsquo;t ready for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does she cry?&rdquo; He asked Avik in a much softer voice suddenly.</p>
<p>Avik shrugged, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He continued his assault on the seat belt.</p>
<p>Oas continued to stare at the kid, gloomy thoughts clouding his mind. Feeling increasingly restless, he asked, &ldquo;Are you going back to your mum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m. Grandma says my mum&rsquo;s missing me. She always misses me.&rdquo; Avik had given up on his fight with the seat belt. &ldquo;Who are you going back to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one. I am going back to being alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone? Do you like living alone? Don&rsquo;t you have a family? My mum says everyone has one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The innocence in the kid&rsquo;s voice caught Oas off guard. &ldquo;I had, once. I don&rsquo;t now since my wife. . . uhmmm. . . you know - &quot; Oas wasn&rsquo;t sure if the kid was old enough to understand the concept of death. This was one more reason he didn&rsquo;t like spending time with kids. &ldquo;<em>They could keep making the mindless fart jokes around you, but say &lsquo;shit&rsquo; around a kid and the whole world starts judging you,&quot;</em> he always complained. Sara was good at manoeuvring such situations; Oas wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Did your wife die?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Oas was taken aback by this unexpected straightforwardness. He gulped the heaviness of the moment down his throat and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she did love you, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Oas nodded again. &ldquo;So, why are you alone then? She must be still around, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oas looked at the kid expressionless. His mind was full of questions that he knew he would get no answers for from this unripe mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mum says the people that love you do not go anywhere even if they die. They do disappear but continue to stay around. They never leave you.&rdquo; He was busy unfolding and folding the tray table over his lap now. &ldquo;My mum says she also is never going to leave me alone. I don&rsquo;t know why she keeps saying that; I know she won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone around had settled down into their seats now. A calmness spread through the plane that Oas didn&rsquo;t share. Uneasy, he stared out the window into the darkness outside, illuminated by the occasional flash of lightning. Within, he was storming through the dreary thoughts.</p>
<p>Anjali was now ready with the security demonstrations. She was used to being ignored, but the kid craned his neck to take in every word she said. Oas, on the other hand, was lost in his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uhhh &hellip; Why do they rush through these security instructions? Do they even want people to understand them?&rdquo; Oas looked at him struggling with the seat belt again. He finally got it open and squeaked an enthusiastic &ldquo;yay&rdquo;.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Cabin crew, prepare for take-off please.&quot;</em> Oas heard the Captain announce. Avik was jumping up and down on his seat; he didn&rsquo;t look alone any more. Oas unbuckled his seat belt, stretched towards the kid and put him back tied to his seat belt. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you unbuckle the seat belt now. Your mum won&rsquo;t want you to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Avik settled back into his seat. Oas locked his stare at the darkness outside. The flight took off, passing through the stormy clouds. The raindrops pattered against the window and then stopped suddenly as the plane cut through the low dark clouds.</p>
<p>Avik had unknowingly slid his hand around Oas&rsquo;s arm. Oas smiled at Avik. &ldquo;Your mum&rsquo;s right. You <em>are</em> a brave child.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>I have been using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blot<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a simple blogging platform with no interface, for quite some time now for running my blog. I am not alone when I say this, but am mighty impressed with how simple it is to post things on blot and maintain the overall site. They are just some files in Dropbox - that’s about it. So, it was pretty straightforward to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->customise the theme<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to my liking and to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->enable the support for IndieWeb principles<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One thing I have noticed, though, is that most of the IndieWeb principles are not visible. They enable a more open web, providing sites a grammar they can talk to one another with. But for someone who owns the website or even someone who reads the posts on a website, whatever changes go in just aren’t apparent. Except, of course, for webmentions.</p>
<p>I have already detailed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the steps to Indiewebify one’s website<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (specifically one built with Hugo). I did not go into the details of setting up webmentions. And that is exactly what I get asked the most about - how does one display mentions along with the posts.</p>
<p>The need is more evident with microblogging - and especially so with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->micro.blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The platform fosters a very active and pleasant community focused more on the interactions (replies) than meaningless reactions (likes, reposts). It also sends webmentions for every reply to a post to the sites that can receive them. So the desire to display the interactions along with the posts, microposts more so, is understandable.</p>
<p>In this post, I will (finally!) document the steps that can help one receive, fetch and display the webmentions along with the posts. The steps are documented from a reference of a blot website. However, the steps below can be altered at appropriate places, primarily formats, to implement the support for any other platform.</p>
<h2 id="essential-indieweb">Essential Indieweb</h2>
<p>Before you can start receiving the webmentions at your site, there is an essential step from IndieWeb to be achieved - to make your website your identity online. It involves declaring openly your social network profiles as <code>rel-me</code> links and link those profiles back to your site. This allows you to login to any IndieAuth enabled services using your website’s homepage - no need to create an account or maintain passwords.</p>
<p>To achieve this, modify the <code>head.html</code> of the site’s theme to add such links to your other online profiles in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element. These profiles can be on Twitter, Github, Facebook, or even email - anything where you can link back to your website from. Some reference links are shown below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">link</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">rel</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;me&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://twitter.com/abcxyz&#34;</span> /&gt;
&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">link</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">rel</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;me&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;http://github.com/abcxyz&#34;</span> /&gt;
&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">link</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">rel</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;me&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;mailto:abcxyz@example.com&#34;</span> /&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>After you declare your website with either Twitter or Github, they can authenticate your identity. With email, a link is sent to the configured email address to do the same, very much like any email-based two-factor authentication.</p>
<p>You also need to declare the service which will act as an authorization endpoint when needed. This is used by other services, mostly IndieAuth clients, to validate your identity. To configure this, just add the below link to your site’s head.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">link</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">rel</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;authorization_endpoint&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://indieauth.com/auth&#34;</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Once you have this enabled, you can test your setup using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Indiewebify.Me<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Test the &ldquo;Set up Web Sign In&rdquo; section.</p>
<p>You are now ready to receive the webmentions from other sites, including Micro.blog.</p>
<h2 id="receive-webmentions">Receive Webmentions</h2>
<p>This primarily involves hosting and declaring a webmention endpoint. Of course, the active IndieWeb community already has a ready solution for this - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->webmention.io<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aaron Parecki<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It is &ldquo;a hosted service created to easily handle webmentions&rdquo;. All you have to do is sign-in with your domain (i.e. validate your identity) and let Webmention.io receive all mentions to your site. Once that’s done, just declare the webmention endpoint as below in your site’s <code>head</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">link</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">rel</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;webmention&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://webmention.io/username/webmention&#34;</span> /&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>username</code> is typically the url of your site (you can also find these details on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->settings<!-- raw HTML omitted --> page). To test this setup, login to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->webmentions.io dashboard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and you should start seeing the mentions sent to your site (which includes the replies on Micro.blog.</p>
<h2 id="display-webmentions">Display Webmentions</h2>
<p>Webmention.io also <!-- raw HTML omitted -->provides APIs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for you to fetch the webmentions to your posts/site. You can implement a custom solution using Javascript for fetching and displaying these mentions along with posts. Below is one of the ways this can be achieved. It specifically pulls the likes, reposts and replies and puts them below the posts. The code might look a bit untidy, but it would be easier to follow what’s going on. You can improve over this eventually.</p>
<p>To start with, declare a placeholder for the webmentions. Place the below <code>div</code> element in your <code>entry.html</code> file between <code>{{#entry}}</code> and <code>{{/entry}}</code> - preferably towards the end of the file, just above <code>{{/entry}}</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">div</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;post-mentions&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">id</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;post-mentions&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">style</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;display:none&#34;</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">ul</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;mentions-list&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">id</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;mentions-list&#34;</span>&gt;
  &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">ul</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">div</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Of course, you could replace the unordered list <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ul<!-- raw HTML omitted --> element with anything else. This is just one of the ways you can do it.</p>
<p>Next, you need to fill this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->div<!-- raw HTML omitted --> element with the mentions the entry has received. You can use the javascript snippet available at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this gist<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to fetch and display the webmentions along with the post. Just place the complete code available there at the end of <code>script.js</code> file of your blot’s theme. So it would look something like below (note that this is an incomplete snapshot).</p>

<h2 id="interactions-from-social-media">Interactions from Social Media</h2>
<p>Though references to your posts from IndieWeb sites are handled, what about the references made on Twitter or Facebook? It can be in any form of response (i.e. likes/retweets/reposts) to the syndicated post. Of course, they do not send webmentions (wish they did).<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One option is to implement your own <!-- raw HTML omitted -->backfeed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to poll for such interactions and handle them as response. Well, the community has made sure there is a simpler hosted option. Enter <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bridgy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bridgy is an open source project and proxy that implements backfeed and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->POSSE<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as a service. Bridgy sends webmentions for comments, likes, etc. on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, and Flickr.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just connect your social accounts with your website at Bridgy and every time there is an interaction about your post on a service, Bridgy captures that and sends a webmention to your endpoint configured earlier.</p>
<hr>
<p>I understand that the IndieWeb journey can get overwhelming. Webmentions are a critical part of this journey and, as I said earlier, one of the more prominent pieces of the overall puzzle. I have never been comfortable using any of the commenting systems, be it those that come native with the CMSes or external commenting systems like Disqus. I have also observed that the new platforms, like Blot or Micro.blog, rarely come bundled with commenting systems of their own.</p>
<p>Webmention has a potential to address that need. I hope the steps detailed above come in handy for anyone who wants to display webmentions on his or her site right next to the posts. The source for the theme that styles <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at Blot is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->openly available at GitHub<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. So, if you like anything that you see at my blog, you can refer to the source and get inspired.</p>
<p>Do let me know if you face issues with getting any of steps carried out. If you don’t face any issue and get everything working perfectly, send me a webmention — the best way would be to link to this post. If all’s well, your links would be visible below this post as mentions.</p>

			 <p>Another introduction where I am involved, as in I listen, happened today. These introductions haunt me, always. Names are exchanged and so is the purpose for visit and some pleasantries. We talk, we laugh, we share. Then the meeting, or the visit, ends. Everything is well and good. That is until we meet the next time. The other person smiles, starts talking. And all I am thinking, of course with a smile on my face, is what the bloody hell is your name again!? As it turns out, the last time we met, it was the name part that I conveniently side-stepped while registering the introduction in memory.</p>
<p>And this occurs with me way too often. Initial interaction happens with the introduction, then I forget the name. At first I just don&rsquo;t take the trouble to know the name thinking may be we just won&rsquo;t meet that often after all.  But the interaction continues. It increases often; we meet more. We talk more. We become acquaintances. We are on the verge of becoming friends. And all I am still thinking of is how the hell should I get this person mouth his name again. Asking for name is absolutely not an option now because I am already in a friend or a known person zone. The bridge has been crossed. So all I do is wait for him or some one else speak the said person&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>And I do realize this is a very assholistic behavior on my part. So this time I decide this behavior of mine has to end. And I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->query the web<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You know what, this is way too common a phenomenon. So common that there are zillions of &ldquo;n ways to remember names&rdquo; self-helf articles across the web. Ways suggested stretch from plain childish to utter foolish.</p>
<p>For example, break the name into parts and remember the parts. Yeah.. a fool-proof way. Only if I could remember to break the name first and remember the parts next. Or associate the name with something. So if you are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ramesh<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I will remember you as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mesh<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. What bull crap. How awkward would it be to think of the made association every time you meet, say <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Vikas or Hardik.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Nope. Not gonna work. Or make the name dance in front of eyes. Or what not. Complete non-sense.</p>
<p>Only thing that made sense to me was to speak the name out aloud. More times, the better. Well that is one thing I can do. That is one thing I am going to do rather. So next time you meet me and introduce yourself, please bear with me if I go on chanting your name in every statement that follows. And so will I if I see you doing the same.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Inferno<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dan Brown<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Going in to the chapter 1 of Inferno, I didn&rsquo;t have too high expectations. I was looking for a breezy page-turner with some anecdotes on sculptures, people, places intermingled with the story. However I was disappointed to see Dan Brown fail to deliver even that.</p>
<p>Anecdotes are way too many and completely irrelevant to the story. Many a times, the novel reads as Brown&rsquo;s travelogue of places during his research, just there to increase the page count. I remember ignoring many paragraphs describing some sculpture or a building or a painting. Uninteresting. Plain boring. Do research Mr. Brown; just don&rsquo;t force everything into a novel.</p>
<p>And there are so many discernible and ludicrous attempts at being relevant to the current tech-aware audience. All the references to iPads, iPhones, ebooks etc. fall flat, cringeworthy.</p>
<p>Finally to the story, what is expected is a mystery to be solved by Professor Langdon through the clues sprinkled in historic symbols. I feel the novel fails there too. Codes and clues are way too simple, straight-forward. Many don&rsquo;t even lead something significant; they are just there to bring Langdon in picture. Inferno could well have been a sci-fi mystery novel instead of a Robert Langdon one. Disappointed.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kane and Abel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jeffrey Archer<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>My rating: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4 of 5 stars<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>First two chapters down and I knew am in for an epic saga. The book had me right from the stories of the two protagonists being christened.</p>
<p>This was one of the finest examples of how the characters are built. Every single one, even the supporting ones, was well shaped. With that done in the backdrop of the historical events, they felt real. To see how each one of the events impacted the characters had a smile on my face. I was emotionally with them in their rise to success, rooting for one at times, while the other at others. Their stories might feel cliched, but I felt them. And then they met, right around the middle.</p>
<p>I felt the second half was a bit weak. The events became forced every time the characters had to meet. Kane and Abel, as individuals, had me intrigued. But Kane and Abel together? Not much. The rivalry felt contrived, childish. Agreed, I was interested to know what unfolded next. But it played out just the way I predicted. Interested, and then disappointed not to be proved wrong.</p>
<p>And I have to mention that the romantic parts were the weakest. Such lifeless, boring mentions of jumbled adult words. There for just no reason. Good they didn&rsquo;t last long, I cringed every time.</p>
<p>Having said all, I did enjoy the novel, an entertaining read. It had me interested in Kane and Abel till the end. And that&rsquo;s where it succeeded.</p>

			 <p>We, the humans, are a race of thinkers. We are pampered while growing up, someone always making the decisions for us. Proving the point from time to time that the decisions they made for us were correct, were for our greater good.</p>
<p>We are deterred from erring. We are convinced that erring is bad. We are asked to make sure we think through what we are doing. We are told that erring can be, should be, avoided by thinking. We end up not erring much. But we end up not doing much. We end up thinking, and thinking again and then again.</p>
<p>In relationship. Do I like her? Does she like me? Will my friends like her? Do I really like her? Will my family accept her? Am I rushing? Am I not going too slow?</p>
<p>While shopping. Do I like this? Does this suit me? Is it better than what my neighbor has? Is it too costly? Does it look too cheap?</p>

<p>We think. We analyze. We halt. Paralyzed.</p>
<p>Analysis Paralysis. That’s what science people call it.</p>
<p>Paralysis, of any part, drives the part unmoving, static. A complete loss of feeling. This paralysis drives complete ‘you’ unmoving, static.</p>
<p>So next time you are faced with such situation where you cannot make a decision, think about what worse can happen if you decide and err. You will be surprised to realize that majority of the cases work out not affecting you much.</p>
<p>Think, decide and do. Don’t overthink, give-up and halt.</p>

			 <p>Another rainfall, another stroll to the cafeteria, another shot of similar feelings. Just couldn’t help but dig out this old post and repost.</p>
<p>Speechless …. That’s how today’s incident caught me. Really felt am i missing something? Am i really enjoying my life? Corporate world has indeed made me dry. Juiceless. Deprived of whatever fun element I had in my life. Saw the wet earth today and there loomed the childhood days in front of me.</p>
<p>Those hours I spent sitting on a sofa employing my eyes out at rain beaten roads. “Chai-Bhajji” or “Pohe” that i relished. Slightest sound of a rain drop that made me run towards the porch. Spellbound eyes of mine that tried to gulp up a sight of lush green fields. An enchanting effect that even a midget breeze created. The restlessness that a sight of river or even a small stream gave me. The dew-laden grass plates that endorsed the mesmerizing capacity of the nature. “Aai” who always dabbed me forcefully in the sweater and monkey-cap. Soothing effect that the cooler-chilled room created after returning from burning heat. Glasses of Rasna i gobbled. Waits for the “Chachaji-Sabu-Raka” Combo. Exchanges of comics and greedily moving through the pages, just to make sure we read the most. Carrom Games, Cards, Cricket matches that we played, ignorant of screeching sun, blowing winter or pouring rains. Dirty clothes that i washed so as to keep “aai” unaware of mud-ridden football matches. And the list just goes on, endless. I never knew what really allured me so strongly. But I do was.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And today, here I am looking at the rain-hit porch from my AC cubical. Without a sofa, “Pohe”or “Chai Bhajji”. Drops kept pouring, waiting for me to run into the porch. Lush-green lawn’s spread out there, just to make me spellbound again. Gone are the rivers/streams and am in the middle of bulk of fountains. But these don’t make me restless. “Aai Daddy” are there, always at the other end of phone line. Mirinda can’t take the place rasna holds. Dan Brown or Sidney Sheldon can’t surrogate “Raj or Diamond”. “Batman-Superman” can easily be kneeled down by “Druv-Nagraj”. Gone are the games. Gone are the friends. Gone are the fun-filled days. Nature’s still out there. Calling me. Waiting to mesmerize me. With me completely oblivious.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Thanks a lot, corporate world. Thanks a lot!!!</p>

<p>Puzzled, the airport executives undertook a more careful, on-site analysis. They found that it took passengers a minute to walk from their arrival gates to baggage claim and seven more minutes to get their bags. Roughly 88 percent of their time, in other words, was spent standing around waiting for their bags.</p>
<p>So the airport decided on a new approach: instead of reducing wait times, it moved the arrival gates away from the main terminal and routed bags to the outermost carousel. Passengers now had to walk six times longer to get their bags. Complaints dropped to near zero.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>There is some great theory there. Man I love human tendency to fool oneself into not hating something.</p>

			 <p>… I won’t be surprised if BJP tags this loss as the failure of UPA government. Someone, mostly Gadkari, might go so far to claim that there is a big conspiracy behind the loss. UPA planned and executed the loss just to divert “aam aadmi’s” attention away from the zillions of unearthing scams.</p>
<p>UPA on the other hand will appoint a committee to look into the loss and give out the steps to be followed, “Committee will come up with the report which will go to PAC that will come to parliament where it will be discussed over and, if any irregularities found, will be open for discussion on action to be taken, followed by the actual action to be taken, given it is decided that another committee need not be formed to investigate the report submitted by the first committee.”</p>
<p>Diggy Singh would suddenly wake up and blurt out “Right-wing Hindu organisation RSS has to be behind this. I have evidence and can prove if I am asked to.” No one will ask him to stop spreading his bloody verbal  dysentery and he will happily go back to sleep.</p>
<p>Manish Tiwari, if asked for comment or if isn’t either, will go on and on with his heavy words artillery and pose another hundred questions at the end of which the initial question will remain unanswered.</p>
<p>Well cricket fans will burn few effigies and wait for the next tour/series/gully challenge trophy where India will play again as favorites.</p>
<p>BCCI will plan another tour (2 tests, 3 ODIs, 2 T20s) against Zimbabwe accepting their offer to pay the money won through win against Bangladesh in return.</p>

			 <p>Change is important. Change is inevitable. But if not, it has to be forced. Change is one thing I plan to undergo every time there is nothing happening around.</p>
<p>Change the way I commute to office. Change the route I use. Change the time I travel. Change the schedule at office. Change the schedule at home. Change the services I use. Change the products I use. I.e. Change everything that’s changeable.</p>
<p>Change something. Change at least one thing. Because that cascades down one’s life to change everything. And this change is important. It freshens one up. It pushes one out of his comfort zone. Rather it just doesn’t allow him to enter a comfort zone; a zone of mechanical activeness.</p>

			 <p>It was second incident in last 2 weeks when I had to select a mobile number for myself. Now this activity may sound simple and non-important. But I always find it an extremely confusing experience.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Think about it. In front of you are the numbers “available” for you to select as your contact number. Now first thing you have to make sure is the number should be at least easy enough to remember yourself so you do not have to open your contact list every time someone asks for your number.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now I always find one which is easy enough to remember myself. But it so happens that the way I say the number is always different from how the person who listens to it utters.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To elaborate, I speak the number this way 4 2345 85 15. (Spaces are the pauses I take.) So simple right. Now this is how the other person repeats it 423 458 515. I am like what the hell. It takes me few seconds to realise both of them are the same.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So the aim is to, if possible, select a number which is easy to remember/recognise, whatever way one utters it. And I very rarely find one.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That’s not all. Lets move back to the initial situation. As I said, in front of you are the numbers “available” for you to select. Available. For you. Only these numbers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So basically these are the numbers which no one, who has selected his contact number earlier, found easy enough to remember. And I have to select one from them. I could, till date, never prevent this thought from entering my mind.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the end, I always end up selecting some number which neither I, nor someone else could fathom at the same time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>PS: Just received a compliment of my number being awesomely simple. So mission accomplished the second time.</p>

			 <p>There is one concept in this confusing world which I absolutely hate. Something called “Timezone”. Who, in their right mind, will decide that from today onwards, we will attach a 3 or 4 letter combination at the end of time and make it a hell of an experience to understand what time it exactly is.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Think about it. How simple would the life have been if the time was same for everyone, 2am is 2am. Irrespective of whether you are in USA or Germany or Australia or India. But no, some smarty pants didn’t like it simple. And in came the senseless words like PST and EST and AEST and IST and what not.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->They did not stop at that. They brought something else called “Daylight Saving Time”. I mean haven’t you made the concept ‘time’ itself enough confusing sucker that now you add another two heavy words before that?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Look at what it does in Australia. Daylight savings is put in place so that afternoons are brightest and mornings are lesser. They move the time further by an hour. So 5pm AEST is now 6pm AEST. I still can’t accept that there was no sensible guy present who crawled at them shouting dudes you are screwing the evenings.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now it does not get dark till 8pm. Yeah bugger 8pm is the time when you can say it is evening. And as a nice middle class Indian kid I am taught to sleep at 10:00pm. So basically I sleep when the evening has just dawned. Screw you Mr. Daylight Saver.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moreover I never understand why the eff was this philosophy put in place at the first place. Not like it is saving hell lot of light or something. Irrespective of this daylight saving, light will remain the same between dawn and dusk. Why add 1 hour rather than simply calling it a day when there is light, not when it is 5am.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now to the outcome of all these twisted minds. Today when some dumbo mentions just some random time, say 2pm, you have to first query is it his time or yours? Lucky you if he is not a dumbo and says yours. But as I have called him a dumbo, he has to say it is his 2pm.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So you have to first think what country he is at. Then think what season/month it is at that place. Then think if it is sunny enough there for introducing daylight savings? Then if it is, find out how many hours you need to add to make sure you know when you need to call him exactly. Thank you, you SOAB.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now don’t be too smart yourself and bring in technologies like google and world clocks and all. Thats not the point.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The point is wouldn’t the world be a little less messy and irritating a place to spend lifetime of yours at, had you not have to worry about as simple a question as “what time is it”?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->PS: I believe there was a reason for bringing all these concepts through. But I also believe there has to be a simpler solution to this worldly problem. I have few thoughts but need to put them in place. Topic for another post soon.</p>

			 <p>Cake was being cut. Everybody stood around the “oh-am-one-more-year-old” guy and all of them were like “cmon-cut-that-cake-now-you-moron”. I stood there hoping that the cursed words do not leave some jackass’ mouth. And they did, against my wish..</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ldquo;Happy B’day to you… happy b’day to you..&lt;blah blah.. blah blah..&gt;&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now 80% percent did hum along the first “Happy B’day to you”. The number, however, dropped exponentially after that. The last “Happy B’day to you” was wished just by a single dumbo. Big time embarrassment I tell you.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>See I am not being cynical here. I am equally happy that this person neared his death by one more year. But the problem is no one sings that song with the feelings it was actually meant to have. Plus the guy for whom the song is being sung is equally embarrassed as those who sing that song. So question arises why sing it at all.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Moreover I always felt whoever sung that song for the first time had something anti-asian boiling in his mind. Why the hell will he compose the third line the way he did then?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Confused? Well you haven’t sung, on top of your voice, “Happy b’day dear Harmoninderpal or Au or Venkataramana” then. I have and let me tell you, it is very effort taking. Need an indication of how effort taking and difficult it is? Well try and make <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nisha Kothari<!-- raw HTML omitted --> act.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So the point am trying to make is stop singing this song. The melody was picked up from some song sung by two kindergarten school teachers in some late 1800’s and it does not suit this age now. Go read details <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Stop being moronic and make all the people involved, cake cutters and cake eaters, embarrassed. Birthday celebrations would be lesser pathetic this way.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>PS: This song singing always reminds of the way we used to hum the “maine pyar tumhise kiya hain..” song during antakshari sessions in front of the girls, which were the ‘things’ we used to interact with just during such sessions back then. Embarrassing, way embarrassing!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>PPS: The key to the “since 1912” part in title is in that link I shared for this moronic song’s history. Go grab a bite.</p>

			 <p>Since I arrived in Sydney, this question has been discussed and fought and betted over so many times among we friends. I mean the moment a clearcut-non-firangi girl is spotted, the next question that pops out is “Is she Indian?”.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The reason is simple. Everyone wants to be on top of his face reading skills. ‘I see them and I identify them’ is what most would want to boast about. No specific take away expected, just a self-satisfaction. And anyone and everyone is ready to bet a coffee or a lunch or a dinner for proving his reign over the so-called skill.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now gone are the days when it was assumed that if someone bets, he must be right. So no one agrees with other, rather he too bets along. Thus these bets always end up being unverified “my-word-to-his” bets.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But that no way reduces the fun in such bets. The theories each side has to defend his view are just innovative, patentable always. Every single aspect, the way she talks, walks, stands, puts on makeup or does hair, is used as basis. You see basics have to be strong every time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However today was different. Another such case was spotted and a bet initiated. This time however both were determined to prove he is right. And decided they will go enquire and sort this out once and for all.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now imagine a situation, when a couple of guys with a bearded attire, resembling a “just-woke-up-hungry-ready-to-pounce” looks, walk to a simple unknown girl and query “Are you Indian?”. Both have the “I-would-win” hope filled looks in their eyes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What can a girl respond in such situation other than a straight “no”. I guess she would negate anything these guys say or ask including “Are you a girl?”. Well that didn’t solve the bet. In came the defence, “The way she said no straight away? She has to be Indian”.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So for me the bet remained unresolved though I commended their courage to carry this attire with such confidence in front of an unknown unidentified girl. The question still remained, “Is she Indian?”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>PS: Girls from china, japan, taiwan, malaysia etc are out of discussion here. I don’t want to sound any way racist, but I will just say we all <!-- raw HTML omitted -->name them under one category<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and move along. They would be having there own internal discussion about their origins the moment they spot one.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>PPS: Such discussions happen even in India when the skill move to a state level, i,e read a face and guess the state.</p>

			 <p>The beasts called elevators end up pissing me off every single time. I had rambled about these dumb asses earlier <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Go grab a bite.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you have read that post, you will know that the ramblings mentioned earlier were particularly about those ill-chipped lifts of that underdeveloped guest house. But now I am convinced these shameless creatures are programmed to torture their inmates.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I mean think about it. What are the decisions these lifeless steel rooms have to make.. (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Inspiration<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>First decision is pretty simple. We make that decision for you, you bugger. You see those glowing numbers on the number pads we keep on pressing one after other? Yeah that is where we want to go. As quick as possible.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Second decision has a whole lot of mechanics behind it. I mean there are some shafts and then there are some holes on some vertical tapes and then there is some counting involved. I would surely like to go in details, but I don’t want to. So I won’t. Visit that inspiration link you see above.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However the part that puzzles me the most is the strategy because that’s when these supposed-to-be angels stop being ones and enter the devil’s land. Now these buggers have to strategise where to go, when to go and how to go. And I absolutely feel that they are not wired to do so. I mean how else can you explain the simplest of the things these dudes screw up.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>How many times have you waited for an elevator to scroll right from 50 meters below basement up to the 14th floor when his other buddy is resting right at the 15th floor? Do they have some gentlemen’s agreement where one simply says “Can’t you see sucker I have just finished carrying 6 fat asses up and down thrice between just 2 floors. I am tired now and you can for sure handle these dumbos”.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>How many times have you jailed yourself in a jam packed elevator as it drools itself down the shaft stopping and opening at each floor. If you are outside, those seemingly endless few seconds you spend when you apply all your permutation skills to see if you can possibly fit in any of the available gaps inside before giving up are just killing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are many other plights of these long travels between floors. But you see the point is the where, when and how part has to be strategised properly.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I will pen down the requirements for you. An elevator, for minimum, has to</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>These are just a few suggestions that can make this floor travel not a sucking experience after all.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>PS: On an unrelated note, why the hell does every single elevator has to have mirrors? Who wrote this unwritten law first? It just gives me one more chance for not letting the elevator know where I want to go and follow a journey to a floor undesired with this lifeless but life sucking beast.</p>

			 <p>Prologue: I have been working on quite a lot of posts recently but could not finish them and bring them to any bloggable format. So finally decided I should repost some old post. Here goes one such post.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yesterday i had quite a random dream. Random indeed it was. For the most part of it i was pretty happy about what i was experiencing. And suddenly i went blank. I would say the dream went blank. Making me befuddled. Completely perplexed. Full of queries, queries for myself to answer. But before i get into the dream itself, let me blabber my views on dreams in general.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dreams are angels. Yes, they have the power to make you experience the bests and worsts of your life at the same time. Indeed we experience the dreams, not just see them. How else can you explain your turning, jumping, twisting, crawling, grawling in the sleep. We are experiencing the event, the dream. I myself have woken up thanking god for turning whatever i experienced into a dream. And then there are those times when i just put myself to sleep again, just to experience what remained incomplete, unexperienced.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Further, the dreams are mutable portkeys. I feel i change lives in dreams. Butterfly effect you can say. But there one can decide if he wants to change his life. Here i don’t. It all depends on my other self, the dreaming threaded me. If he wants me there, i go. Otherwise i just lay here, wake up and continue.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Details. Two threads, if dreaming together, show how the life each is experiencing. We exchange both the positives and negatives. Yes, if you notice, each dream comprises of both goods and bads. We experience some scenes of that life, both happened and yet to happen. Yucks and Wows. If both agree to switch, we switch.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now you see this concept explains a lot of usualities. Take Deja Vu. Yes indeed it is that ‘yet-to-happen’ scene of the life. We experienced it in the dream before we made the shift. Those jerky wake ups. May be the other self just slapped me for spending such sucking life. Or may be i did it to him for his sucking life. Roaming with unknowns. Yes, you don’t afterall expect two me’s having the same set of friends. Those long nights can be the result of just a mismatch between timings of two threads. Same goes for the short nights.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I will stop. Remove your thinking caps and plunge into the dreamland with the view. You might find quite a few interesting answers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyways back to my dream i dreamed yesterday. I dreamed i was a singer, i was singing well. (Ok, i never said the other me has to be “me”ish. He can indeed me quite contradictory to who i am right?) Audience were happy. I saw my struggle. I saw my first assignment. I was watching myself happy. I watched all the happy me’s. Nothing bad. No yucks. And suddenly it was blank. I don’t remember something like this happening earlier. The dreams changed. The places changed. I woke up suddenly. But it never happened that the dream turned blank, with me facing eternity full of whiteness.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Puzzled, I lay there, closed eyed and open minded, waiting for something to happen. But all in vain. Blank. Whiteness everywhere. Finally i woke up and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tottered my way along<!-- raw HTML omitted --> … With mind full of questions. Unanswered question.</p>

			 <p>Tomorrow I am going to travel through the time to the future me. It’s been long that I was planning for one such tour. However just for the need of the future currency, I had to postpone my travel to tomorrow.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In a moment, my friend will return from his visit. I have asked him to smuggle some future currency back to the past. To maintain the time conundrum, I will believe that, as of today, I do not know if he does bring it in. (However the fact remains that I have made the travel tomorrow. So this should clarify the doubts over whether he did. He did. Successfully. Believe me!)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Anyway there was some small calculation mistake while carrying the digit forward, which I normally do, that made me end up a day behind where I was supposed to end at, i.e. tomorrow. Now I do not want to disturb the normalities in here, the past world that is. So I will prefer hiding in this panic room and simply pen down my experiences of this drive.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The first and foremost observation, technology has spoiled the human race in there man. People only speak in command prompt queries. A sentence is no longer than 3 words, the longest (and oldest) being “I am sorry”. (And even there, people hardly mean it!)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Every single software is run by Google and hardware designed by Apple. There is an antique building called “Microsoft Live Centre”. I heard it has hanged in the messy green screen of death that displays a Matrixsque live feed of random numbers. Some say it has gone offline from the day it’s services were tagged “Live”. (By the way, don’t tell anyone. but there were still rumours about the apple tablet and google phone.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However fun was when I met my future me. The way he was behaving I still feel, as <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Zaphod Beeblebrox<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> would say, “if I ever met myself again, I will hit myself so hard I won’t know what’s hit me.”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>By the way I wanted to tweet this there and then itself. But that future me just laughed at me when I said it takes 140 characters for us to share what we are doing. He mentioned even the novels are 20-30 characters long in there. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->crypto-tex-pander<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fitted in each person’s eyes just completes the novel. Idiots I tell you.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Sat for lunch and there there was another surprise. Those idiots there hardly eat any food. They just gobble down the pills for all the necessary vitamins, minerals and whatever necessary for the body. Floored I was to see they even have the pills for the junk food. These future mens are idiots. Extreme idiots.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Oops!! Need to hide. Someone is crawling towards this dark damp corner. Will blab out the remaining idiocracies of the future. Trust me. There are many. Did I tell you what they have a UCC, a Universe Conservation Committee, a group fighting the Universal Enpansion? Well they do. Blab you later. Ciao!</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2009/12/14/211300.html">Thoughts on movie making (and reviewing)</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2009/12/14/211300.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2009-12-14 21:13:00 &#43;0530">Dec 14, 2009</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Just finished watching “The Negotiator”. A tense drama between two negotiators that was . Well at least for three-fourth of the movie. After which I think the director fell prey for the behaviour which I am seeing a lot recently. However I have no intention here to post a review about the movie.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Actually these days I have lost belief that reviews actually hold any credibility. Not just do I find them monetarily inspired, but they are also dependent on many external factors. This makes it practically impossible for two viewers to watch a movie with same frame of mind and same expectations.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Well not to forget the reviews themselves rig their own viewpoint on the moviegoers. So a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Taran Adarsh<!-- raw HTML omitted --> might make each Yash Raj Film an extreme must watch while <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Masand<!-- raw HTML omitted --> makes the same one the extreme bore of all time. Two thumps down he would scream. However what the movie ends up being is not any of those.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Not just is this case true for the actual critics whose bread and butter is film reviewing. Even friends that unwelcomely review a movie for me, make it difficult for me to watch any. One likes any movie he watches, another says “ah Bollywood sucks”.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So hardly is it possible for me to decide which movie to watch based on anyone’s comments. Ironically the most of the movies that I have loved recently are the ones where I had no clue about their plot or performances. So no reviews for me I say.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Anyway back to the pit that most of the directors fall in. I call it the “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->lets-make-it-goody-goody<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot; pit. See when you have made a strong impression on audience by throwing at them what they least expected, you don’t take an unwanted <!-- raw HTML omitted -->faltu<!-- raw HTML omitted --> turn saying “Hehe buddy, there I fooled you.”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One most cliche scene I would like to mention. In a movie with 2 heroes, one kills other at the most unthinkable stage. Only is it revealed momentarily after that both were together in this and no one’s killed. That was part of the bigger plan. Villain is caught and yippie, everything is goody-goody.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Well, screw you Mr. Goody G. Goody. You could have made the movie hell lot better by killing that god damn hero, and making this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gaddar<!-- raw HTML omitted --> friend fly away with villain and all the money. Why is there a mental block to show “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->achhe ki jeet aur bure ki haar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot; (good wins bad leans)? Well not that this is how the real world behaves, is it?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Anyway even extreme wonderful movies like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Departed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> could not dodge this pit. Only thing I can say is it takes guts to end movie with not so “goody-goody” a situation. I remember one movie which managed to do that. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Mist<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I still fell saddened when I remember the ending there. Hats off to you Mr. Frank Darabont the director. You had managed to give a most unthinkable horror an horror movie can give its audience. Extreme unthinkable.</p>

			 <p>He gets up in the morning and sees sun rising at him through the small slit, left open at the window by curtains. It is that soothing early morning which he has always savored. He crawls out of his bed and takes a warm shower. He gets all tidied up with a desire to embrace the pleasing spring morning. He puts his foot outside and starts his walk towards the office.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hardly does he walk hundred meters, dark clouds start gathering the sky. He looks at the sun and loses him among the clouds.  The spring morning is ruined by the darkness of the clouds hovering above. They roar and kill the sweet chirping noise of the birds and burst into a heavy uncalled and untimely rain suddenly.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now the situation above is not just a one off incident.  It is not the roaring clouds or the rain that bothers me. It is the untimely fashion one faces them.

I won’t be exaggerating if I say that summers have more rains now than actual rainy seasons.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don’t know if this is actually a result of Global Warming phenomenon. I don’t know if this is really a effect of greenhouse gases. There are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->facts and figures<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which say they are. Then there are those who say this is just a cyclic effect. This does happen in centuries where climate behavior repeats itself.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For me what matters is what I see and I can guarantee something is for sure not normal. I am tired of watching farmers committing suicides because the climate does not behave as it should. I am tired of watching crops getting ruined by the lack or or sudden pouring of rains. I am tired of watching people die because of all the floods and droughts, storms and tsunami. I am really tired.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->effects<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of, if it exists, global warming are pretty saddening.  I had decided I won’t take the risk of ruining what has been a pretty wonderful place to live. I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->will do whatever<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I can for that and have already started that by thinking about it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After all I don’t want to end up telling my grandchildren, “Once there were seasons and climate changed with them”. And I surely don’t want any one to end like this.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

It happens to me a lot, but this particular week gave me a double blow.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->First incident was when i did not back out when i should, though debatable, have. I trolled along the darling harbor idling my time out just because i did not have any other place to go. Out of no dire need, i felt this itch to go to the public telephone booth and, well, do nothing.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I picked up the handset and there began my efforts to place a call.

Should i or should not pick this $2 up which does not belong to me? I don’t remember for how long i stayed near the booth but last thing i remember i had extra $2 in my pocket. Debatable if i should have picked the coin, but i did.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fast forwarding 2 hours later. My idling location shifted to a mall where after about an hour i decided i have crossed my idling quota for the week.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I came out with my iPod plugged in and whistled along the road towards train station and somehow felt everything was pretty bright around me. I knew i had a train in another 15 mins which i should not miss as there was no other train for another 90minutes. My eyes burnt and my subconscious mind was aching for something. And there it dawn on me why everything was indeed bright.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next thing i remember i was running towards the mall to find my goggles worth way more than $2 i had picked up earlier. Whole time during my run to the mall i was thinking was that $2 really worth all this pain of losing costly goggles and missing train.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Final blow, however, was about to come. I reached the mall, found a sensible looking pretty lady and asked if they have found any goggles. She looked more optimistic than what I was. She ambled inside putting me on hold. After some time, she came out and said something which ignited my fuzzy brain cells again.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->She said they have found one goggles, but they were ladies and if I think mine were, well, ladies goggles, she will get them from the security. Now I did not want to make complete fool of myself in front to pretty looking and sounding girl by saying I wear ladies goggles. But i did not want to not make any try too.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I thought for sometime what to do and then putting my manly pride ahead, I remember I mumbled something and came out. Whole time afterwards, i was soothing myself by thinking this.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A visit to a supermarket is not something uncommon for me. Rather it is one thing which i like doing the most. Crawling between those numerous branches full of variety of products, i just lose myself glancing at each one’s properties… beep .. engineer’s blooper .. i should have said “each one’s labels”.</p>
<p>However, the visits are always satisfying and refreshing for me. And this is the first reason i find myself roaming in these lanes quite often.</p>
<p>Another reason for these frequent ferries is my lack of interest in creating the grocery lists. I have tried jotting them few times, but i so get lost within the products catalog that the chit doozes in my pockets.</p>
<p>At times i spend hours just ambling around the nooks and corners of a supermarket. A sensible mind might think what would one do for so long in a place so crowded, so noisy, so meaningless and so mean. But thats what i like about this place. I get my space in here with no one remotely worried about what i want. And that’s when i start getting choosy about each and everything i would buy out of this space.</p>
<p>First thing i need to do is put a limit on time i would spend in there. Once that is sorted out, it is all about marking my spots to ski along. Vegetables and fruits fall out of my interest and a hustling visit settles down the formality.</p>
<p>What follows is a child-like admiration for the variety of products manufactured, packaged, transported, marketed and sold at such colorful a place. A cheerful mouthfreshner sits in front of the saddened and ashamed toilet cleaner. Colorful chocolates sit next to the colorless eggs. And there i know its time to get lost. Get choosy.</p>
<p>And choosy i get. Tens of minutes are spent in front of each product looking for what fits better for my needs. I know sometimes i have spent too much time and worried i get thinking the cameras might caught me goofing around at the same position and i might be busted as potential terrorist. But what the hell  .. risk is worth it.</p>
<p>And then there are those times when i don’t get choosy thinking i know what i want and i have got what i want. And this is what i buy.</p>

<p>And this is what the description read (which i happen to read when i rinsed my mouth with this dude)</p>

The life has changed and so have people, places around me. I am not a pleasure freak. The only thing I ask for is the change. For that matter I do not even mind spending my days at a village as long as I get a break from usual casualties of life.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Casualties they are. Each moment each day life throws loads and loads of experiences at you. Some are feather soft. Providing you with the feel-good comfort in its zone. And then there are those emotion laden heavy experiences trying to crush you under it’s weight. Casualties to your mind is what they can leave behind. And casualties is what they leave behind.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So the break was indeed welcome. It has indeed been welcome. For the better part of this change is the feeling of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->differentness<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But this same “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->differentness<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot; is what pops up in between; a small compartment in mind still calls out for those same buses. Those same roads.

			 <p>I had earlier prated at facebook about how things never go wrong but they usually are wrong. This post is more about the incident that made me babble that out.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This particular incident is not a one off experience. It happens with me most of the time. I have started believing the quote, that one gets what he gets only when the time is right, far strongly than ever before.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So right from the morning today, i was hopelessly beating my head against numerous things interconnected. Code not getting configured, tools not running properly, system slowing down like hell … and what not. In simple terms, all the things that could possibly go wrong were going wrong.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tried my best to bring things back on track. Even tried the ever successful way out of chanting random rants in the loo. But nothing seamed to work. Day went by with me fighting the villainous time. And suddenly right on the verge of me giving up, something happened and everything got sorted out.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I felt like yash raj was scripting a movie with me, the helpless protagonist waiting for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->non-hero-non-villain types <!-- raw HTML omitted -->neutral time to sort things out, a la Amrish puri in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DDLJ<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Here ditto Yash Raj’s script, how the solution appears does not matter.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Many times the all time hidden <!-- raw HTML omitted -->problem creators<!-- raw HTML omitted --> suddenly loom out of nothingness. Or at times the same components which were adamant on not working get a mind change and start working. You sit there dumbfound trying to grasp what happened. Worse is when all the twisted knots straighten up when a new person pulls a thread, making one look a complete idiot.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way today’s was the first case. The bugger emerged from the tonnes of characters and the problem got solved. Time was 7:02pm. Felt i was destined to solve the problem, but not before 7:00pm 28th May.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A new problem, as usual, has come into existence tough. Yashji’s planning a magnum opus this time, i guess. So awaiting another day of head banging for a solution which i know i won’t get before <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the time gets right<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nothing actually goes wrong, it is always wrong. What is worth mentioning tough is when it goes right!!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Another day spent with hardly any interesting updates in life. Truly speaking many things happen. Mind wanders around, surfs over various topics instead of diving deep into a single significant job at hand. Result is i am unable to get attached to any of the things happening around me.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The question arises what really does one need to make the mind notice what is happening around? Interest in what we do should be the first and most important thing. But what I don’t understand is why do i suddenly take raw interest in the same work which i wasn’t enjoying earlier. It must rather be something else .<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->According to me, they are the things that happen around me that actually decide if i notice what is happening around or not. If my mind feels they are worth noticing, it will notice them. Else it temporarily captures the images just to wipe it off the mind’s canvas, sooner rather than later. The problem is this “sooner” comes too soon for me to make even a slight impact.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Does this mean things around me are insignificant? I don’t thing so. Rather the things around me these days are like the monotonic long silences in Oscar winning movies; they are no way insignificant, however they hardly make any sense to me. I would rather prefer the insignificant, but joyous jabbers of Adam Sandler than Leone’s blunt eye shots. And i need to soon find these jabbers around me!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just watched this wonderful village lady, Susan Boyle, nailing another awesome of her performance.

			 <p>The title does sound, atleast for me, a bit self-boasting one. I dunno about others for whom &lsquo;being mysterious&rsquo; may quite well turn out to be &lsquo;yuck&rsquo;ish. (I know even my use of words sometimes is mysterious. You would surely have, if you have roamed round this blogosphere enough, come across many.)   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Anyway mysteries has always kept on the edge of my seat. I have cherished even the worst of the mystery movies ever made. I even have a darn respect (!!!) for the makers of few of the movies, whose reason for existence itself was a mystery. Same goes for books or for TV shows. But more than anything else, what turn me on are the mysterious real life experiences. I have spend lots of my network bandwidth digging through the news stories about however foolish but mysterious incidences that happen around us. And it was this interest of mine that led to the existence of another blog of mine. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Realm of Mysteries<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Along the journey there, I will keep on jotting few mysteries i, over the net, bump into. The stories may not be fully inclusive of all details as I have no intention to &lsquo;wikipedia&rsquo;ize the blog. Though they surely will provide required links for fully understanding them.</p>

<p>But before moving straight to the answer, let me take you through the line of thoughts my mutable mind followed along. A plain look at the title and it made me think &lsquo;Damn!! How on earth did they find that? Were they running around, scissors in hand, chopping each and every frog they cross, looking for their bloody bellies (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->pun intended<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) for any abnormalities in them? And what did they think of as an answer they would provided to all those normal, but with a robbed sac like belly, frogs? Would a &ldquo;Hey sorry mate! We are searching for your deviant buddy. By the way, do contact a doc soon.&rdquo; do? Nah it won&rsquo;t. How can they be so irresponsible towards the nature. They indeed are answerable to the frog fraternity.&rsquo; Now i don&rsquo;t think this path is too abnormal. Any sensible one would have thought on the same lines. I felt mighty of myself for being so empathetic and felt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that this needed to be blogged<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But that feeling wasn&rsquo;t there to last for long.</p>
<p>As i strolled through the story, the reality came into picture. The answer for &ldquo;what was it that they have&rdquo; earlier arose. It takes loads of  patience, time and prolonged interest for hitting something so uninteresting and so &ldquo;evolutionarily unique&rdquo;, as they call it, head-on. How else can you explain the fact that when the friends of this enlightened scientists were busy lurking  behind the materialistic pleasures, his majesty was busy searching for this mighty frog community, one of whose member he saw when he was 30 years younger. It required a mind full of unsatisfiable quests and determination not to find solution. How else would you explain the fact that once he did find one of them, he continued his quest to find 8 of their kinds and tore their lungless tummies apart before going &ldquo;EUREKA&rdquo;. I thought this answer that i mined was &lsquo;pen&rsquo;able and again felt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that this needed to be blogged<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I wish this was enough. But they went on to explain how their closest relatives had lungs and what that really means. Finally they didn&rsquo;t even forget to connect this with manly attempts to ruin the mother earth and a need to stop doing the same. Also a call at the end to protect earth from  facing this &ldquo;huge impact&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now all this was enough to make me feel <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that this needed to be blogged<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And hence this attempt. Anyways now their&rsquo;s some other line my thoughts are following. It is after i saw few similar titles that read &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Man charged with theft left his son<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;,  &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Robber left name on job application<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; and &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Suspect took cab to and from the bank he robbed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;. Let me know your line of thought. I will post mine soon. Think&hellip; Think&hellip; Think&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>All of the above, though being pretty random, just couldn&rsquo;t motivate me. But as i was bluntly looking at my blog today, few striking facts about my previous post held my attention. First, my post was on Feb 14th, Mr.Valentine&rsquo;s &lsquo;some&rsquo;day. And topic was &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Earn Security, but at a price&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ldquo;. Though quite unintentional, but see what great sense it makes. Its this rosy day, that if you enjoy, you have to lose your liberty (control myself?? forget&hellip; ), equality (how dare one asks to be equal with the almighty partner), justice (when i know i have to agree that the person in front has to be right, whats the point asking for justice), freedom (what freedom can a criminal expect when he sentenced life imprisonment for himself). You do this and you sure will earn security, security for commitment. Just make sure you do burn your entirety.</p>

<p>Answer: When the chunk of metal that serves as the official international standard for the kilogram, under triple lock-and-key in France since 1889, inexplicably sheds a little weight.Very little, though.

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I always come up with a statement &ldquo;Sachin is not a Match Winner&rdquo;. And if you try to go to the depth of the statement, you will find that the people mainly complain about following issues:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) He never sails india to victory.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) He is never there till the end.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3) He never strikes in a crucial stage.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4) He never plays well in finals.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->5) He plays only on the Batsmen Friendly Indian Pitches<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->6) He is not like Lara, Steve Waugh or Bevan.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Before we start looking at each issue, lets try to answer a couple of questions first:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) Who is a Match Winner?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) Can a single person win the matches for a country?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ok so lets move to the first question. So is &ldquo;Match Winner&rdquo; the one who stays till the end? If that&rsquo;s the case then Srinath and Kumble were the match winners in the 3rd match of Titan Cup played against Australia on 21st October 1996. But still the man of the match award was given to the Sachin. Because he was holding one end of the indian innings when the greats like Dravid, Ganguly and Azar were making their way to pavalion. He was sailing India home with a great victory but for a good ball which he just happened to misjudge. This was the innings that created a base for the &ldquo;rare&rdquo; nice flicks from the two Bangaloreans and made them to take India to a fantastic win and they get full credit for doing it with perfection.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now lets consider a Test Match. Take the 2nd test of the Border-Gavaskar trophy played against Australia on 26-30 December 1999. The first innings of Australia saw 405 runs. Thanks to great innings by Slater, Langer, Gilchrist and even some fine knocks by Fleming and Lee down the order. India&rsquo;s 1st innings score was 238 which had a fine inning of 116 from the Little Master. He was the 9th man to get out. Then Australia scored 208 runs before declaring their second innings. In the responce, India just managed to score 195 runs again having an inning of 52 from Tendulkar. But then he could not sail india to victory at last. Still the man of the match was given to him. Can we imply from this test that Sachin was not a match winner as he didn&rsquo;t won the test for india? No we can&rsquo;t!!!!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But then you again can&rsquo;t say that Sachin was the match winner in the First match we discussed. No he wasn&rsquo;t. On the contrary, no one can be a match winner in a team game like Cricket. You cannot neglect the support he got from Jadeja and Mongia that helped him to to take india on the verge of a win and then the nice flicks from Srinath and Kumble that sailed India to victory. You cannot forget even a small contribution of 30 odd runs in Cricket because that, with a partnership, counts big. Even in case of the test discussed, same thing would have happened if sachin would have got some support from his fellow teammates. The fault was not Sachin&rsquo;s — it was just that India could not find a Fleming/Lee who could score some runs down the order in the first innings.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->People may query &ldquo;why are you just considering these two innings?&rdquo; Or may be something like &ldquo;You are getting biased&rdquo;. But then I am not discussing the greatness of Sachin. I am just trying to judge the statement about match winner concept which I totally disbelieve exists. I think these facts are good enough to prove that the fist two issues can be discarded when you say he is not the match winner and very well answer the two questions we developed.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So lets move to 3rd and 4th issues. I think these don&rsquo;t need to be discussed seperately as they are too similar. No situation can be more crucial than the final of a series. Here i will just like to ask one simple question. How many of these finals would india have reached but for Sachin? Does it not take some fine performances to win the matches which take us to the final? C&rsquo;mon man. After all he is an human being who too has got limits. Nobody in the world can be perfect and neither is Sachin. But the mere fact that he doesn&rsquo;t play in finals unlike few others (not Indians offcourse because i guess no indians play well in finals) doesn&rsquo;t reduce his briliance.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Or it can again not imply/disprove that he is not a match winner.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The fifth query can be considered in two parts. 1) On Batsmen friendly pitches: Ok then i think this is a part of the game. Sachin is a batsmen and every batsmen is considered to play well on batsmen friendly pitches. But it will be wrong to say that he plays only on batsmen friendly tracks. Because he do have a few innings under his belt to disprove this statement including the ones at bulawayo and johannesburg against Zim and SA. Lets move to second part.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2)On Indian pithces: This statement will be best judged by few statistics which I will soon come up with.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lets move to the last and the most important comment. He is obviously not like Waugh, Lara, Inzi. He is far ahead of Waugh and Inzi and in case of Lara, I will just say its better not to judge one greats performance in the vision of the others. But I can say one thing. Sachin may not be a Steve Waugh but then he does not have a Warne, Gillespie or Lee who could win a match by hitting the last few runs after he scores a century. Lara and Waugh both had great teams to back their efforts, not just a few good players like what Sachin has. Tendulkar has shone as the lone gladiator for India.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I think everybody should stop worrying about who is a batter match winner and enjoy the game of all the greats. One thing is for sure. Today, when Sachin goes out to bat, he has over a billion people praying for him. So, whether he is a MATCH-WINNER or not, who cares: he is a HEART-WINNER. Today&rsquo;s great moments are tommorow&rsquo;s sweet memories. Though Dravid might be &ldquo;the great WALL of India&rdquo;, if you look beyond the wall you can see a monument, an &ldquo;Unconquerable Everest&rdquo;, in Sachin Tendulkar.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the end, I would just like to put a plain request to all those who debate on this topic. Just leave the man, who has given 14 years of his life to his passion, alone and don&rsquo;t put him under a microscope. This will sure help you enjoy the numerous innings he had played and the numerous he is yet to play. I CONGRATS THE LITTLE MASTER for all the fine innings he has played and wish him all the best for his remaining carrier. So bowlers beware. SACHIN AALA RE!!!!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
