			 <p>Learnt a new word today, &ldquo;inchoate&rdquo;, while reading Writing Is My Drink - it means &ldquo;rudimentary&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>I realise it&rsquo;s not easy to take sketch notes. I usually do not take too many notes. And when I do, I am always in rush. I need shorthand, something that takes less time. Sketches don&rsquo;t do that for me.</p>
<hr>
<p>I tried the Artifact app today - TikTok for text. I don&rsquo;t get it. It&rsquo;s a terrible experience, full of ads, because apparently, news portals deliver ads sprinkled with the news. And the app opens the portal&rsquo;s original pages. No way to default to reader mode. Even sharing is painful as there&rsquo;s no way to share the original URL but the Artifact one. Basically, the app is a ploy to beef up engagement. Another disappointing news take.</p>

<p>When spectacle and larger-than-life characters are ruling the movie screens and box offices, such a heartwrenching yet endearing story shouldn&rsquo;t be missed. If you have read the book, watch it for Hanks&rsquo;s portrayal of Ove. If you haven&rsquo;t, you <em>must</em> watch it for everything.</p>

			 <p>I watched <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kuttey">Kuttey</a> yesterday &ndash; what a terrible letdown. Given the list of artists as part of the cast and crew, I had such high expectations. But the skill of being a competent storyteller cannot be faked. It tried too hard to be cool, &ldquo;new age&rdquo;. Every frame screamed that it was inspired by the style of Guy Ritchie or Tarantino. Or even Bharadwaj&rsquo;s own Kaminey.</p>
<p>What the Jr. forgot is it isn&rsquo;t the style that made these directors what they are.</p>
<p>Everybody was trying too hard &ndash; even the seasoned actors looked uncomfortable playing the part. A short run-time of 90 minutes felt too long, even though the screenplay was fast-paced. I kept moving ahead scene after scene because I knew exactly how it would play out.</p>
<p>Barring the last 15 minutes, hardly any part catches your attention. Sigh! Such sheer waste of talent.</p>

			 <p>I attempted to watch Netflix&rsquo;s new docuseries &ldquo;MH370: The Plane That Disappeared&rdquo; - and it&rsquo;s absolutely terrible. It gives focus to too many characters, goes all over the places and never returns back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s the story they want to tell. It&rsquo;s not what happened to the plane or who is responsible or even how it affected the people related to the passengers on-board. It tries to do all of it and does half-assed job at each.</p>
<p>I would recommend listening to the podcast episode on this topic by <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1oWeqQp4wW88wGD6ka8fqa?si=9LAZb3LYQrSs_kWdIfbvlg&amp;app_destination=copy-link">Stuff You Should Know</a>.

			 <p>I have stopped using YouTube on my phone for quite some time now. Even my iPad and laptop, I use it very carefully. I do not like what it has become, especially the home page. Google&rsquo;s aggressive recommendations and creator&rsquo;s ability to game it have made it home to clickbaity and idiotic content.</p>
<p>Google wants to make YouTube addictive, and I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2019/12/26/070000.html">want to fight back</a>. Here&rsquo;s the way that worked for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I either access the video directly (if I know what I want to watch) or browse my Subscriptions page (when I don’t know what to watch). The home page is useless without history turned on. And so are other recommendations. Trust me; you do not want them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, Google has managed to ruin the subscriptions screen too.</p>
<p>As if the recommendations for sensational videos weren&rsquo;t bad, Google found another way to spike engagement or our addiction to the app - shorts. I have been vocal about <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/07/15/as-far-as.html">my dislike</a> for this form of content.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that Google seems to be aggressively pushing it on creators, making it more profitable in some manner. Now my subscription page is full of short videos, with no way to filter them out.</p>
<p>The high-quality videos are getting lost in this drivel of mindless shorts, even from the creators I respect. I do not know how some of the most intelligent minds are ok with this. I have seen this play out to written words &ndash; the long-form essays are lost amidst the hot takes and rants on social timelines.</p>
<p>Google has done the same to the last sane space on the platform. I can now simply get rid of my usage of this platform altogether.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Google, and thank you!</p>

			 <p>I thoroughly enjoyed <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt24516518/">Vaalvi</a>, a Marathi dark comedy thriller. I don&rsquo;t remember the last time I laughed out this loud while the characters in the movie handled one serious situation after another. I wasn&rsquo;t laughing at the idiocy of the film or the characters; rather, <em>the movie wanted me to laugh</em>. Therein lies the brilliance of this film.</p>
<p>Is it perfect? Absolutely not. But it&rsquo;s an intelligent film. Sure, it has moments where it leans towards absurdity. But if you recognise the tight budget for Marathi movies and ignore such rare moments, you can enjoy even the absurdity thoroughly.</p>
<p>I wish this movie was more readily available. Do watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm0s7r3kRKw">the trailer</a> &ndash; I am sure you will enjoy it.</p>

			 <p>I watched all four episodes of <a href="https://www.netflix.com/in/title/81617079">The Romantics</a> today. I loved the first two that documented the early life of Yash Chopra and the Yash Raj Films. I especially enjoyed the references to the early 90&rsquo;s movies &ndash; especially the music. That was also my biggest gripe with the docuseries &ndash; it just didn&rsquo;t speak enough about Yash Chopra&rsquo;s taste in music. And <em>his love for lyrics</em>.</p>
<p>I remember listening once to Javed Akhtar on how valuable the lyrics, the words, and the poetry was to Yash Chopra. &ldquo;If music is the body of a song, lyrics are its soul,&rdquo; Javed Akhtar had said. Yash Chopra understood that.</p>
<p>So as I got nostalgic while listening to all the songs from the yesteryears &ndash; Waqt, Kabhi Kabhi, Silsila, Chandni, Darr  &ndash; play in the background, I wished the makers of The Romantics had spent a whole episode just on his appreciation and quest for good music. There are so few Indian directors left who still value music as a core identity of movies. Yash Chopra was one of them.</p>

<p>YouTube sucks away time without you noticing. The best way I know to control this beast is to not be available to you. The web app is a pain enough to not be distracting. So just get rid of the app from the phone and get your time back.</p>

			 <p>While responding to an observation from Ben Werdmuller, Om Malik <a href="https://om.co/2023/01/25/is-stream-as-a-design-paradigm-over/">asks</a>, &ldquo;Is reverse chronological &lsquo;stream&rsquo; still a valid design principle?&rdquo; I believe the answer is complicated.</p>
<p>As with most folks commenting on Om&rsquo;s blog, I have been a follower of his writings for a long time. And also been a blogger since updating one&rsquo;s blog, and visiting others to look for inspiration was a multiple-times-a-day activity. It still matters for all of us who have consumed the stream of blog posts. Or at least we understand it.</p>
<p>I generally follow blogs through RSS, where a stream is meaningless. But I would still follow a linked post to a new blogger that I don&rsquo;t know about. I then browse through the stream of posts to see if the blogger&rsquo;s topic and writing interest me. If it does, I subscribe to his RSS. So the stream is important for me for discoverability.</p>
<p>But the people who haven&rsquo;t ever consumed such a stream of blog posts may not find it helpful. The algorithm has spoilt us with the &ldquo;recommendations&rdquo; &ndash; the links to the other stuff on the platform.</p>
<p>So we as bloggers should serve the same. Recommend stuff to the reader on <em>our platform, our blogs</em>. On our home pages. And around our posts. But instead of letting AI decide, let&rsquo;s curate these recommendations manually. We have all the tools that we need. Tags/Categories. Let&rsquo;s add a few layers if required.</p>
<p>I have already started doing this with my blog. I have modified my home page to take readers to specific sections of the blog. I have separated posts prominently. I want to introduce a few more sections on blog and around posts. This is all still a work in progress, though.</p>
<p>Another tangential thought. We have stripped our blogs of all the fun in our quest to get minimal. Do you remember the tag/word clouds? Posts by date? By category? Or most commented? Let&rsquo;s bring them all back. We had more than one way of presenting our blogs to the readers. Why did we stop that?</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780307463746">Rework</a> by Jason Fried today 📚</p>
<p>I loved the simple, usually apparent suggestions. Most go against the proven and often advised business best practices. I love the bold ideas and the no-nonsense way the suggestions are delivered through simple short chapters. But, I am afraid I will not be able to benefit from most of them. Jason targets folks like him who are in positions of decision-making regarding how their businesses are run. Not many are in that position. So, as much as I would love my organization to follow even a few of Jason&rsquo;s suggestions, I am afraid I cannot influence that.</p>
<p>That said, though, I will keep the book close so that I refer back to the clarity of thinking that Jason has lived his business career with. I hope it comes in handy someday.</p>

			 <p>My family and I watched <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/strange_world_2022">Strange World</a> yesterday. I don&rsquo;t remember when I was this unimpressed with a Disney movie. The makers attempted to hit a lot of big ideas but forgot what story they wanted to tell. The world-building is half-baked and foolish. The emotional parts bore you. The climax is dull.</p>
<p>My wife quipped, &ldquo;Disney doesn&rsquo;t know how to make a movie with a male protagonist.&rdquo; After all, when did Disney last make a movie with a strong father-son dynamic? Maybe Nemo?</p>
<p>This comment from <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/strange-world-review-disneys-audacious-new-animated-film.html">Alison Willmore&rsquo;s review</a> of the movie resonated with me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So much of Strange World’s audaciousness is front-loaded into its concept, and so little of it comes through in the execution. Its themes linger in the mind longer than any line or emotional beat in part because those elements feel so rote and secondary.</p>

My current listen, <a href="https://www.audible.in/pd/B07HB4ZXTT?source_code=ASSORAP0511160007">The House of Silk by Anthony Horowitz</a>, narrated by Derek Jacobi, is one such book. With a good intriguing plot and wonderfully involved narration, I am having so much fun listening.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781781251485">The Obstacle is the Way: The Ancient Art of Turning Adversity to Advantage</a> by Holiday Ryan today 📚</p>
<p>Laced with real-life examples and a corresponding lesson in each chapter, Ryan Holiday presents valuable insight into handling obstacles. Nicely structured in three sensible parts &ndash; perception, action and will &ndash; this is a good, practical guide to staying balanced without getting bogged down by roadblocks and failures in life. Ryan doesn&rsquo;t want to make this a guide for stoic philosophy. Instead, he sprinkles the best of the lessons throughout the book. That helps keep things simple, which most books on Stoicism fail to do.</p>
<p>As he mentions towards the end, many people he tells the tale of &ldquo;embodied the best practices of Stoicism without even knowing it&rdquo;. Ryan recommends that just doing matters more. For his intention to not complicate the philosophy, he deserves credit.</p>

			 <p>My aversion for the concept of timezone is not hidden - I probably have an yearly post begrudgingly accepting the fallout of this weird phenomenon.</p>
<p>What makes it worse though is how each region is allowed to select their own timezones. This makes the situation messier than anything to do with time should be. Just search YouTube for weird timezones. There are ample examples of how we have screwed this up.</p>
<p>I read about another such <a href="https://www.howderfamily.com/blog/australias-weird-little-time-zone/">weird little timezone from Australia</a> - given the size and nature of the region involved, this has to be amongst the craziest.</p>

			 <p>I love taking portrait shots of my daughter. Her expressions are the focus, and everything blurs away in the background. Anyway, what matters to me is my daughter&rsquo;s smile or the lack of any. Each expression more priceless.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2022/ddc631a7ca.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>I hope to live my life in the same manner, in portrait mode. Put things that matter to me in focus. Blur the sidelines into the background. It might be messy around me. It always is. But to let it impact my perspective towards the moment or not is my choice.</p>
<p>So a friendly reminder for myself - put what matters in focus. Make the ugliness that surrounds me the blurred background. It may only heighten the charm of the moment.</p>
<p>And as with photography, not all perspectives can be portraits. But <em>some certainly should</em>.</p>

			 <p>Since I moved microblogging to my blog, I have always focused on getting the look of the short posts right. I didn&rsquo;t want them to be lost amidst the prominent titled posts. Nor did I like it the other way around. That meant I never had either looking how I wanted them. Well, that&rsquo;s not the case anymore.</p>
<p>After a long time, I am finally happy with how my <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/post/">long-form articles</a> and <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/notes/">short-form notes</a> sit distinctly together. The setup took time and some <em>crazy personalization</em>, but I had to shake a few things just for the sake of it. I had started taking my blogging too seriously, and I didn&rsquo;t like that. I work better when it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>The only downside is that it is an entirely custom and personalized theme. And for now, I am okay with that. Plus, it&rsquo;s still a work in progress.</p>

			 <p>Every service wants to be everyone&rsquo;s favourite. But what the makers are working towards is being favoured. Or popular. There is a minute but significant distinction between those two.</p>
<p>It is easy to market something subjective, which is what the latter is. &ldquo;Best&hellip;&rdquo;. &ldquo;Most liked&hellip;&rdquo;. &ldquo;Hottest&hellip;&rdquo;. How often do we hear those words in advertisements? The former, on the other hand, is binary. Objective. You are either someone&rsquo;s favourite, or you are not. More often than not, people won&rsquo;t know what their favourite something is. Ask someone for their favourite movie or a book, and she can&rsquo;t put her finger on one.</p>
<p>Being a favourite is also singular. What point is being just one person&rsquo;s favourite? You can&rsquo;t market that. Of course, as long as the someone in question is not famous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder if seeking to be someone&rsquo;s favourite is more satisfying than trying to be popular to everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seth Godin made this observation in <a href="https://seths.blog/2022/10/americas-favorite-pie/">one of his latest posts</a>. Well, it&rsquo;s not about satisfaction but the ease of selling.</p>

			 <p>I have never had the dark mode turned off since the option was made available on my devices. I did today. After an initial bout of pain, things don&rsquo;t look too bad. Instead, they look cleaner. The whole experience - the platform, the apps, the websites - is so very different.</p>
<p>One thing is pretty apparent - all the interfaces look better in the light mode. As if the apps are designed for the light mode first. The setting, the interface elements, and the colour palette look ingrained. With the dark mode, all apps look the same &ndash; white text on limited shades of dark background. Maybe that is the reason many people prefer this mode. Irrespective of the app, it looks the same.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind a diverse collection of interfaces. So against the wishes of the techie in me, I will extend this experiment for a bit longer on my smartphone. I will use it with the dark mode turned off. It can&rsquo;t be too bad, right?</p>

			 <p>Choices are abundant these days - more variety of cuisines, more brands of clothes, more range of devices, more solutions. More of the same, yet <em>different in imperceivable ways</em>. More is good, right?</p>
<p>Not when the dread of choosing paralyses me. Making a selection demands brain cycles, both while and after choosing. It needs time from you. If there is real money involved, the process is even more demanding. Fear of regret kicks in then.</p>
<p>Is the other one better? Cheaper? Would I hate this later? Will my family hate me for choosing this? Will this improve my life? Each question is more complex than the previous one.</p>
<p>In the false hope of &ldquo;saving&rdquo; time and money, I postpone choosing. My unmade decisions pile up, and so does the burden on me. It is a vicious cycle – I delay choosing because I feel vague pressure, a choice that only adds to my burden.</p>
<p>Not choosing is a choice too. Make it your default, and it will only make you weaker.</p>

			 <p>Ever since I published the Paper theme to Micro.blog, I wanted to port one with multiple columns and yet stay minimal as possible. I&rsquo;ve found one, and today I managed to port it to and customize it for Micro.blog. The theme, called <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/79">Anatole</a>, is a beautiful minimalist two-column theme. You can check for yourself in the screenshot below or see it live on <a href="https://amit-test.micro.blog/">my test blog</a>.</p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/am1t/microdotblog-anatole/master/images/screenshot.png" width="760" alt="Anatole theme screenshot" />
<p>The theme is <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/79">available in Micro.blog&rsquo;s Plug-ins directory</a> and can directly be installed from there. Note that <strong>the theme is compatible with Hugo 0.91</strong>, which is available as a setting on Micro.blog. You can follow the below general steps to install the theme.</p>
<ul>
<li>Uninstall any theme that you have installed as a plugin.</li>
<li>Set your current theme to blank and Hugo Version to 0.91 in the design section of your blog.</li>
<li>Make sure there are no other conflicting custom CSS configured for the previous theme.</li>
<li>Install the &ldquo;<a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/79">Anatole theme</a>&rdquo; plug-in from the directory.</li>
<li>Once the theme is successfully installed, you can configure the social icons displayed in the header by modifying the available options as plug-in settings.</li>
<li>Additionally, you can configure parameters to display full post content on the homepage, disable animations and provide a path to a custom favicon.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was fun to bring another option to Micro.blog&rsquo;s already brilliant collection themes. I hope you like this and that a few folks benefit from it. If you do, I would love to hear from you. All feedback is welcome.</p>

<p>Whenever I watch my dad live as he excitingly shows me a new shirt or a new faucet, I am happy.</p>
<p>I am happy when my phone guides me around a place, known or unknown. Alerts me of road closures or diversions. Reads the text in front of me. Or helps me with my quick queries or requests.</p>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>And I am only talking about the capabilities of the devices on me. I am surrounded by technology that brings a smile to my face every day throughout the day.</p>
<p>I can be frustrated by the things these gadgets cannot do well (or can&rsquo;t do at all). Or I can be angry with them when they alter my habits against my will.</p>
<p>But just as the technology is at fault for not acting responsibly, so am I for not using it sensibly. When <em>I wish</em> the technology to alter itself to not burden me, <em>I share</em> the responsibility to find ways to not be controlled by it.</p>
<p>Do I have enough levers? That&rsquo;s debatable. What isn&rsquo;t, though, is my love for technology.</p>

			 <p>If you write a blog and are interested in conversing with your readers, do include a link for the reader to do so right below your every post. I would love it if every blog post had a way for me to respond. A comment form. An email address for me to mail the writer at. Or even a link to the social media where the post is syndicated. Basically, redirect me, the reader, to any place where the conservation is taking place. I can, of course, theorise why most people have stopped doing that.</p>
<p>First, the spam industry has dampened one of the promises of the internet — having open connections with people on the web. We are afraid now that we will be bombarded by comments and messages that we have no interest in sifting through. Second, most blogging platforms have stopped providing an easy way to enable conversations, which came built-in with WordPress and others. It’s an added decision (and even a cost in some cases) for the writer to provide such an option to its reader. A trouble that many folks just don’t want to sign up for.</p>
<p>I wish that wasn’t the case. My conversations with people around the words I write have been an essential aspect of my blogging for the past many years. If you haven’t tried that, or you did but aren’t doing it actively anymore, give it a chance again.</p>
<p>You take the trouble so that your user doesn’t have to.</p>

			 <p>Our species' collective common sense is on a downward trend; my movie theatre experience yesterday proved this again. With mobile phones in their hands, they kill the vibe with the ringtones and flashes. A few pick up the calls in the middle of the movie. Some peek at their phones out of habit just to check the notifications. So what&rsquo;s fricking wrong with these folks? Can you not stay away from the dopamine-inducing notifications even for a couple of hours?</p>
<p>There is also a crazy trend on the rise recently. People are creating reels of theatre response — a highly anticipated scene begins, the entry of an important character or a dialogue or a fight sequence, and people have their smartphones out recording the screen. What the fuck, man!</p>
<p>I am ready to pay extra for watching a movie at a theatre with a &ldquo;no smartphone allowed&rdquo; policy. I know it&rsquo;s near impossible, but a guy can dream, can&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p>A sidetone, the movie I watched was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikram_Vedha_(2022_film)">Vikram Vedha</a>, and I absolutely loved it. I don&rsquo;t care that it&rsquo;s a remake. It is <em>remade</em> well, in the right spirit, and backed by solid performances.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781526647115">Stolen Focus</a> by Johann Hari today 📚</p>
<p>I loved the premise of this book but found the second half unconvincing. Sure, lack of sleep or hunger or extended work hours does lead to loss of focus. But they do harm our society in a lot of other ways. We can&rsquo;t point to every problem that plagues the world today and say it affects our focus. Similarly, ridding ourselves of the focus problem can help us solve even more significant issues. But without concrete actions, it is all talk.</p>
<p>The extent of topics that Hari wants to cover with the book is too spread for my liking. I wished it was more focused on the subject.</p>

			 <p>Even though I knew deep within that it was coming, the news of <a href="https://www.espn.in/tennis/story/_/id/34596649/roger-federer-announces-retirement-play-laver-cup-final-event">Federer&rsquo;s retirement</a> saddens me. Being an Indian, I never thought I would watch any sport as intently as I watched Cricket. Or cheer for anyone as loud as I did for India. Federer made me do both &ndash; this man is why I fell in love with Tennis.</p>
<p>I cheered every time he effortlessly hit those winners <em>precisely where he wanted</em>. There was some elegance to his aggression that always attracted me, something that the ferocity in the play of his competitors lacked. As his rivalry with Nadal grew, so did the craze amongst us tennis-crazy friends. The respect for both lived through many heartbreaks, one particular during undoubtedly <a href="https://youtu.be/f8YEiCAPAbg">the greatest match</a> of all time.</p>
<p>As the sport moved on, leaving the beauty of the master&rsquo;s gameplay behind, I moved away from the sport. I have never enjoyed the game since. Yet whenever Federer participated in a tournament, I refreshed the scores during his matches. I hoped that he managed to swat a winner against his tiring, ageing body. Just as he did through his graceful backhands over the years. Alas, it wasn&rsquo;t to be.</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing cheer to millions of faces. We <em>and the sport</em> will miss your game, GOAT.</p>

Though the answer to that question usually is &ldquo;well, it depends why you need it&rdquo;, I agree with all of the must-meet criteria that she lists down &ndash; good RAM,  good display, good keyboard (<em>with backlight</em>), good connectivity and good battery life.</p>
<p>In addition, portability and form factor matter to me. Too thick, large or heavy, and it no longer is a laptop in my eyes.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t get Apple&rsquo;s iPhone 14 lineup. Let me be upfront and say I have no intention of being an asshole. Or to troll Apple. I am genuinely curious if Apple has improved iPhone 14 (non-Pro) in any significant way over the last year&rsquo;s model. Even S models from yesteryears had more significant upgrades. If I am wrong, I must have missed reading something between the line.</p>
<p>If there ever was a generation of iPhones that the previous year&rsquo;s model could be recommended over, this lineup has to be the prime candidate.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780753553909">Think Again</a> by Adam Grant today 📚</p>
<p>Though the book is in no way short, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Grant presents numerous ideas across sections and chapters &ndash; some focused on individuals, others on teams. Some on one&rsquo;s personal life, others on the professional one. Given the recent trend of expanding trivial ideas into a book, I admire the depth Grant attempts with this book.</p>
<p>Sure, not everything works for me. Not all suggestions are practical. A few chapters and their conclusions contradict the more significant point being made. Some sections just have no relation to the central premise of thinking again. The conclusion sounds weakest as if it was added after the thought (something that Grant acknowledges in the Epilogue).</p>
<p>As I struggle today with forming opinions amidst the information overload, this was an essential read. Every help I get to <em>think better</em> is welcome.</p>

			 <p>I have been using a MacBook with Touch Bar for the past couple of weeks. I used this panel regularly for the first time. I can see why Apple wanted this to stick &ndash; when it works, it works well. For example, Zoom puts the buttons for full screen, mute, and video on/off front and centre. It, no doubt, speeds up the flow. But searching for the escape button is an absolute pain!</p>
<p>Apple screwed up the execution. Instead of <em>replacing</em> the row of function keys, this should have been an additional panel above the keyboard. It was ok even if this was available on the larger MacBooks only. But, alas. Apple knows better.</p>

			 <p>I wonder if no one on Micro.blog creates any type of long-form posts using the web editor. I can&rsquo;t be the only one who finds this interface too limiting. It is suitable only for short updates. The goal of keeping things simple shouldn&rsquo;t hamper the experience of writing posts. Whenever I attempt to write a long post with this interface, I instantly look for other options. Sure, I don&rsquo;t switch. But I would <em>love</em> to avoid having this feeling.</p>
<p>Saving and building on a draft is unnecessarily complicated. Keyboard shortcuts do not work consistently &ndash; undo/redo often messes up the post. This is exasperated by the already small editor window. In addition, the experience is not consistent between writing a new post and editing a draft.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time I have complained about the writing interface. I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/08/06/231037.html">wrote this</a> almost a year ago (and that wasn&rsquo;t the first either).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The editing experience remains poor for long-form posts – both from a desktop and a mobile device. It&rsquo;s a great system with a promising base, but still has a long way to go before I can use it for the longer form content.</p>

<p>Neither <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/the-web-new-post-page-needs-basic-features-please/1090">am I the only one</a> with the request. The editor is the most essential part of any blogging system. I hope Manton gets time to work on fixing it, an ask that&rsquo;s pending for too long now. Without this, the platform isn&rsquo;t fit for the blogging needs of full-length posts.</p>

			 <p>There was a time when I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2019/04/24/105500.html">listened to podcasts</a>. Then I stopped doing that. There was a time when I scrolled through Twitter and Facebook, and we all know that story. Eventually, I also <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/07/15/as-far-as.html">stopped watching YouTube</a> videos. I detached myself from every form of passive consumption. I came to this realisation, and here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/01/10/what-about-social.html">what I wrote</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All my concerns stem from this &ldquo;user-engagement-at-all-cost&rdquo; business practice. Irrespective of how pleasing this interaction feels in the moment, it leaves me furious for the time wasted. Twitter timeline is prone to do that. YouTube&rsquo;s homepage does that, and so does its recommendation engine. Instagram and Facebook feed do that. For me, even Reddit forums tend to do that. Debatable, but Podcasts do that too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I am either listening to audiobooks or reading books, newsletters or articles from the subscribed RSS feeds. Yet, I still feel I do not have enough time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have time to watch that 10-episode TV series. I don&rsquo;t have time to read the list of articles I have saved to read later. I don&rsquo;t have time to play games or read comic books. And I have accepted that I cannot consume these forms of content, for the lack of a better word.</p>
<p>But, it saddens me to realise I don&rsquo;t even have time to read everything I want. And I am not even looking at the growing list of to-read books.</p>
<p>How does one find the time?</p>
<p>I could read a book or keep up with my RSS subscriptions on a particular day. But unfortunately, I cannot do both. Maybe I don&rsquo;t know how to stop myself in time or structure my day in a routine.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, I don&rsquo;t have enough time to read all that there is to read. I have read a few articles and books that address this problem of the apparent shortage of time. But I haven&rsquo;t found a solution that works for any meaningful period.</p>
<p>Maybe, I need to make peace with the fact that I cannot keep up. I cannot keep up with the growing list of brilliant books. I cannot keep up with the gifted writers churning beautiful essays. And, with a heavy heart, accept that I am okay with it.</p>
<p>Disengaging from passive consumption has helped me. But there&rsquo;s too much good content that I can&rsquo;t keep up with.</p>

			 <p>I am not a horror movie fan. I have seen a few over the years but do not enjoy them. With age, my patience with them has further gone down. I do not watch this genre at all anymore. Or so I thought.</p>
<p>I was recently reminded of my dislike as I read <a href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-horror-movies-of-all-time/">this list</a> from the editors at Rotten Tomatoes. I realized that there <em>are</em> few movies in this genre that I have enjoyed. Or I do still enjoy. The likes of The Mist or Jaws Or The Shining. Or the number one on the list, Psycho. Or the one I thoroughly enjoyed recently - Get Out.</p>
<p>Basically, I don&rsquo;t mind psychological thrillers. Or ones with creatures. But I am done watching haunted houses and ghosts and unnecessary gore.</p>
<p>That said, I do enjoy reading the plots of the movies, predominantly from the horror genre, that I have no interest in. I have read so many movie plots on Wikipedia. I was anyway not going to watch the movie. By reading the plot, I at least know that the one twist the movie was sold on is shit.</p>

			 <p>I watched <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_batman">The Batman</a> today &ndash; I am glad that after a few terrible few showings, we have a good setting again. It&rsquo;s not a perfect movie &ndash; it&rsquo;s too long and too thin. But I loved the way it&rsquo;s shot, it does &ldquo;look and sound brilliant&rdquo;. The first half is particularly gripping. I didn&rsquo;t like the Riddler though, his eccentricities felt forced.</p>
<p>That said though, the first thing this movie made me do was rewatch a few sequences from The Dark Knight series. The heights that Nolan took this superhero to is hard to scale.</p>

			 <p>I no longer am the prolific blogger that I once was. I won&rsquo;t comment on everything that I read these days. Or post every thought I have.</p>
<p>I read what a few people write and realize maybe I am not as natural a blogger as I thought at one point. Writing doesn&rsquo;t come <em>naturally</em> to me. Knowing that English isn&rsquo;t my primary language, I knew what I write in the language won&rsquo;t sound natural either. In my school, even my English teacher didn&rsquo;t speak in English. English became my primary communication language pretty late in my life. So I am aware that the way I use some words or the structure of my sentence must sound wrong to English-speaking readers.</p>
<p>Not that I blame my struggle with this foreign language for my recent slump in writing. It&rsquo;s true that I never wished to write perfect prose. The recognition that it conveyed what I wanted was good enough for me. But it&rsquo;s equally true that writing is not easy for me. It takes effort.</p>
<p>I would love to believe that my writing has improved over these 15 years. But I am also conscious that my desire to write frequently, differently, hasn&rsquo;t improved. Instead, it has been impaired recently.</p>
<p>I feel bad when I struggle to garner the drive to word my thoughts and I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/07/20/there-are-times.html">wrote about</a> <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/07/21/i-find-and.html">my frustration</a> <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/07/24/an-unpopular-opinion.html">a few times</a> recently. Looking at my blog without anything meaningful added newly makes me feel worse.</p>

<p>A short, but brilliant read. Housel writes in an easy-to-follow manner even though the topic he talks about is not. Some might say this belongs to a series of blog posts. But the chapters and respective takeaways sound coherent.</p>
<p>As Housel mentions, there cannot be a single investing strategy for every person out there. Each individual&rsquo;s background is different. Their goals are different. And so are their perspectives. In the same spirit, two individuals cannot have the same set of takeaways from this book.</p>

			 <p>I have been a PC guy since I was 10 years old. The first version that I used was Windows 95. I stayed the longest with Windows 98. I fell in love with Windows XP even on my PC hardware that didn&rsquo;t support the OS well then.</p>
<p>However, what I had for this platform wasn&rsquo;t love. For the small town I am from, Windows was the default platform. At home, in school and at work. Mac OS wasn&rsquo;t a name anyone had heard. Linux was limited to textbooks.</p>
<p>I dabbled with the latter during my bachelor&rsquo;s and the developer in me was instantly captivated. It wasn&rsquo;t ready to replace the default OS on my desktop though. There was still some time to go before it could go mainstream. So like most folks around me, I dual-booted Windows and Linux.</p>
<p>However, I believe things have improved since then. There are many &ldquo;flavours&rdquo; of Linux today that target users beyond developers. Why not then should I give them a try again?</p>
<p>So I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/05/30/i-have-replaced.html">have been running Linux</a> as my primary OS for more than a few months now. I haven&rsquo;t missed my default platform yet. It may not still be ready for all the people that Microsoft targets with Windows. But it is ready to be the default platform for many tech-minded folks out there.</p>
<p>I am not going back to Windows anymore. I don&rsquo;t have any incentive,</p>
<p>PS: I am trying <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/google-chrome-os-flex-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-use-it/ar-AAZrwUy">Chrome OS Flex</a> currently. I am pretty impressed with this flavour of an operating system. It&rsquo;s light and fast. Plus it also runs Linux now. Except for the fear of Google, this platform has a lot going for it.</p>

			 <p>I find and read a lot of brilliant articles/essays throughout the day. Most are shareworthy which I freely do. But I have realised too much reading is unfavourable for my writing. The mind gets inundated with others' thoughts. I tend to first be affected by them, then overanalyze them and soon get paralysed by them. It&rsquo;s not a healthy chain of events.</p>
<p>I am reading a lot more than I am writing. I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind yet that it is bad. But I need to balance them both.</p>
<p><em>Garbage in, garbage out</em>. Sure. But <em>only in, nothing out</em> is equally bad &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t matter that it&rsquo;s only the best that goes in.</p>

			 <p>My daughter regularly uses the assistants at home &ndash; for timers, for reminders. To play songs that she loves. She even asks questions about things she gets curious about. She loves Alexa and talks to her as if talking to a friend. She can work with Google Assistant &ndash; it always gets the job done.</p>
<p>However, she doesn&rsquo;t like Siri. I set a timer for her with Siri today &ndash; it didn&rsquo;t take her long to move it to Echo. Well, I can&rsquo;t blame her. She asked Siri how much time was remaining on her timer. Siri replied, &ldquo;I am sorry, I can&rsquo;t do that here.&rdquo; <em>How can you not do something so basic?</em></p>
<p>Once my daughter was done, I asked Siri to cancel the timer. Well, she repeated that she can&rsquo;t do that. Sigh!</p>

			 <p>I suck at emojis &ndash; I don&rsquo;t understand this language. Why are there so many representations of the quality of laughter? Grinning, Smiling, Beaming and whatnot. I understand each word means something different, but conveying that through the right emoji is a task in itself. I mean seriously, what&rsquo;s the difference between emoji representing &ldquo;Grinning Face with Smiling Eyes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beaming Face with Smiling Eyes&rdquo;? I will never know that.</p>
<p>We have around 3600 emojis (<a href="https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-counts.html">3633 to be exact</a>), which include gender or skin tones. Isn&rsquo;t that number too large? Plus it keeps growing every year. Sure, add new emojis that people want and anticipate. But remove a few tens that get hardly used. Who uses Dotted Line Face 🫥? What does it even mean?</p>
<p>Emoji is a powerful language &ndash; fastest growing at that. But it need not grow meaninglessly.</p>
<p>Side note, did you know 😭 is <a href="https://emojipedia.org/stats/">the most used emoji</a>? It represents the pain that is using the right emoji.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday, I ranted about <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/07/15/as-far-as.html">how Youtube is aggressively pushing Shorts</a> in their feeds and recommendations. Of course, the quality had taken a huge nosedive. Well, just look at the explore tab of YouTube. I very rarely do, that section always had poor-quality videos. But at least they were full-length ones. Now it is full of shorts with each having millions of views.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so much collective time wasted. We need to move on from shaming social media and its addictive nature. These short videos are ruining our habits and I see very few are complaining.</p>

			 <p>As far as time wastage goes, short video services are the new social media. YouTube Shorts, Reels whatever. I have realized this mindless format of the content is eating up too much of my productive time. YouTube, in itself, was bad. But at least there was a chance that I would learn something. With Shorts, it&rsquo;s a total waste of hours, a minute at a time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t watch Reels because, well, I don&rsquo;t use Instagram. Or Tiktok. Or <em>whatever app that&rsquo;s trending now</em>. But I keep going back to YouTube often when I have short time to pass. I hate that the app is aggressively pushing the Shorts nowadays.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that the videos are trash. They are neither fun nor informative. They register only as much as a dented luxury car would &ndash; I go &ldquo;huh, that&rsquo;s odd&rdquo; and move on.</p>

I relive the charm and the excitement of spending time with a growing child.</p>
<p>There are no notifications that I look forward to more than the ones from Day One. This is a worthy investment, both the subscription cost and the cost in terms of time to note the entries. The words I might have found meaningless then read like a heartfelt memory today.</p>

			 <p><em>I</em> don’t write a newsletter well. <em>I</em> don’t understand this medium. I have tried it a few times now. The first time, I published it as a links log, sharing links that I found useful. Then I made it personal, a letter about what’s up with me. It could well have been a blog post, every time. A weekly digest of my posts was a good tradeoff between a mindless link log and why-can’t-this-be-blog-post thought. But it felt meaningless.</p>
<p>To be frank, I don’t want to sign up for the added dance around subscribers and their numbers. I like it when I don’t know anything about who reads what I write. Also, I enjoy it when I am not forced to stick to a schedule of any sort. There are periods when I am highly active, writing, and sharing regularly. But then there are times when I don’t.</p>
<p>Newsletter wants to force a schedule onto me. Without a schedule, a newsletter is just another outlet for my blog posts.</p>
<p>I am an instinctive writer, my writing does not have any structure. Or nature. I write about anything and everything that interests me now. Because I <em>read</em> anything and everything that interests me now. My blog serves me best for the form of writing I do. Newsletters work for many — I enjoy reading them. But the form is not a natural fit for me.</p>
<p>So, I  am done with my newsletters experiment. Every issue I have published <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/categories/essays/">is available on my blog</a> as an essay. I intend on keeping it this way. <a href="https://amitgawande.com/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> continues to exist.</p>

<p>The sense that one has become the instrument of invention is so satisfying that I find it truly stupefying that anyone would claim that artists are motivated to create primarily by the money they might get from such miracles. Not to say they shouldn&rsquo;t be paid. Paying them provides them with more time and liberty to channel art. But it&rsquo;s a rare artist who&rsquo;s in it for the money. A real artist creates because he has no choice. He is pressed into the involuntary service of art, and thereby, humanity.</p>

<p>When writing, and also when doing research for writing, it’s important to get the details right, but that doesn’t always mean what you might think. Economy of detail is usually better than excess, which raises the critical question about which details matter most.</p>

<p>An insightful read this, <a href="https://mattgemmell.com/verisimilitude/">Verisimilitude by Matt Gemmell</a>. I found this suggestion really on the mark.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research is a distillation. You’ll spend two hours reading, to get four paragraphs of notes, which provide eight words of story — but those eight words will take the reader into the world you’ve created, and create the impression that your character really is there, or really knows about this topic. Just make sure it’s either unremarkable that they would know those things, or that their knowledge has been explicitly accounted for.</p>

			 <p>A smartphone with a case is just not the same device. I have never used a device without a case ever. A slippery slab of fragile glass just doesn’t feel comfortable sitting in my hand. So, I just wrap it in a case and carry it along. It gives the device a physical and me a psychological cushion against any accidental falls. But every time I take the device out of the case for cleaning, putting it back in the case feels like a crime. It loses all its charm. Every device looks the same with a case on — the camera bump, the notch, the punch-hole fail to help.</p>

You write not what you like, you write what you think your reader likes.</p>

			 <p>I have come across many guess-the-word games recently, mostly after Wordle. <a href="https://semantle.com/">Semantle</a> is another one, but is different in many ways. It&rsquo;s not limited in number of attempts. The help page says, &ldquo;You will need more than six guesses. You will probably need dozens of guesses&rdquo;. Sounds about right. Plus it has hints. Yet it feels difficult and exciting. Do give it a try when you have some time.</p>
<p>PS: It took me 21 guesses, 3 hints to get today&rsquo;s word.</p>

			 <p>I have released an upgrade (v1.1) to Paper theme for Micro.blog today that allows modifying the default behaviour of the homepage. It includes a setting now to display full post content on the homepage of the blog. Here’s how the homepage with this setting on will look like. You can also check the same on <a href="https://amit-test.micro.blog">my test blog</a>.</p>
<img src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2022/paper-update-1.1.png" width="600" alt="Paper Theme 1.1." />
<p>This is one of the most asked for features since the first release. I could never get the look right without ruining the spirit of the theme. Or so I like to believe because the change isn’t too significant in itself. So, irrespective of which option you decide to go with, the homepage should feel as part of the original simple and clean theme.</p>
<p>If you are using the Paper theme, look out for the upgrade option in Plugins. It should be enabled soon. As always, if you find any bug or want any improvements, kindly let me know either as <a href="https://github.com/am1t/microdotblog-paper/issues/new">GitHub issue</a> or connect with me on <a href="https://micro.blog/amit">Micro.blog</a> / via <a href="mailto:reply@amitgawande.com">email</a>.</p>

			 <p>I read a lot many long-form posts that are published with Substack these days. I know that’s anecdotal, but I wonder if Substack is becoming a blogging platform of choice for folks now. Or newsletters are newsletters no more? Well, what is a newsletter?</p>
<p>I like when a newsletter is more than just a list of links. Or a bowl of jumbled, unrelated recommendations. Not that I don’t enjoy them — I appreciate the effort that goes in curating these best-of reads. I have found them useful many a time. But deep down, I <em>love</em> reading letters. It reminds me of the days when I used to post handwritten physical mails to my family and close friends. Those words had an innate charm and closeness. I enjoy a newsletter that’s a letter first.</p>
<p>That tangential thought aside, I believe Substack is a publishing platform for newsletters first. But given the way it is set up, it is also a publishing platform for the long-form posts. If you don’t subscribe to a publication, most probably you are going to read it as a blog post. That’s what seems to be happening to me.</p>

			 <p>With many avenues of tracking and improving my well-being already around me, I have decided to make the best use of them. I know I am not good at maintaining a healthy routine for any meaningful duration. Yet, I want to give myself another chance to succeed at forming one by constant nudges and tickles.</p>
<p>A reference to <a href="https://www.wholelifechallenge.com">Whole Life Challenge</a> (h/t <a href="https://www.cygnoir.net/2022/04/16/i-made-it.html">Halsted Bernard</a>) with its pointed question “What is healthy to you?” front and centre came in handy. The tagline, “don’t try to fit health and wellness into your life. Fit your life into the context of health and wellness” resonated with me. I always had the tools that allow me to track my progress towards a healthy lifestyle; with the recommendations from this challenge, I know what I need to track. I am not undertaking any challenge, but I am going to follow along.</p>
<p>So, I am tracking the seven habits – nutrition, hydrate, exercise, mobilise, sleep, well-being and reflect. With health apps from Samsung and Google, I make note of everything I eat, being cognisant of my diet. I don’t want to cut down on anything yet, but just understand what goes in. Keeping myself hydrated is not a problem I face, I drink enough water regularly.</p>
<p>Though I already do the running and stretching pretty regularly, I am now consciously walking while carrying out the daily chores instead of riding my motor scooter. Though I can’t sleep with a watch on, I now manually enter my hours of sleep. Sure, I miss out on the detailed reports of my sleep pattern, but this is better than nothing. With the bedtime mode scheduled on my smartphone, the screen goes greyscale, reminding me to rid myself of the clingy device. It helps!</p>
<p>Building a habit for well-being has been difficult for me. Meditation, the only well-being activity that I know of, never stuck. I can meditate, but I don’t do this with the right spirit. A constant thought of “am I doing this right” keeps pestering me throughout, and I know I’m <em>not</em> doing it right. Well, who knew there are other well-being practises too – picking up a book, reaching out to a friend or organising a disheveled space. Ah, now <em>that</em> I can do. And do well.</p>
<p>All said, these are early days. I am just a week into tracking these habits and I have already missed out on a couple each day. (I am using a wonderfully simple app, Loop Habit Tracker, to track these). But I am allowing myself the leniency.</p>

<p>We just had the last IPL some 5 months back, didn’t we? And here we go again already. The lust to milk the most out of the hottest property on Indian television had to come back to bite them in the bums. They are killing the sport for generations, old and young. 🏏</p>

			 <p>I have been pretty happy with <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/03/27/i-upgraded-to.html">Galaxy S22</a> that I recently purchased, and yet, I find it surprising that my friend’s circle chose it over iPhones everytime to click pictures. This choice is driven by Samsung’s preference to make the pictures look better, clearer over Apple’s to make them look close to real. People who understand photography will always prefer the latter, the most of the mainstream will prefer the former. No surprise, some unknown Android devices keep winning the blind smartphone camera challenges that tech reviewers carry out, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp4nWm59esI">one Marques Brownlee does</a>.</p>
<p>A tangential thought, what do you call the folks that are not experts? The non-reviewers. The enthusiasts. Or the nerds? These are the folks that form the majority market, ones that most companies target. I always struggle to find a term that isn’t derogatory to either side. I at times call them common folks, but it doesn’t sound right to me. Neither does “normal” — that makes the tech enthusiasts, the group I belong to, non-normal? Again, doesn’t sound right. I recently heard someone call this section “muggles”. Yuck! Have people even read the books?</p>
<p>Anyway, back to my device selection. I have been part of the Apple ecosystem for a long time. When I recently switched to Android with a OnePlus device, I was worried that I may miss the benefits of the ecosystem. Well, I did. But not enough to make me go back to the Apple devices. With a Galaxy smartphone now, I had a chance to get back to an ecosystem of sorts again. Samsung has over the years build a viable alternative for each Apple device. A shameless copy initially, now all of them have an identity of their own. One such device is Galaxy Watch 4 which is different from Apple Watch, yet equally powerful when paired with a Galaxy smartphone. For the past week, I have been enjoying how both these devices work together. Samsung’s strategy looks to be working.</p>

			 <p>I had no idea Pebble (or at least part of it) was purchased by Fitbit. Almost 6 years back. So unfortunate we didn’t see any launches of inspired products from Fitbit. One with an e-paper display and good battery life. I would have loved such a device.</p>

			 <p>I can’t remember the last time I enjoyed listening to a book as much as I did <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary">Project Hail Mary</a> by Andy Weir. Of course, Weir deserves a lot of credit for writing such a smart book. But I am equally impressed by the performance, the voice acting by Ray Porter. I have rarely listened to an audiobook where I can’t separate the narrator and the central character in the book. Most of the folks read the book, performing the dialogs by characters differently every now and then. That wasn’t the case with Porter — he became the character Ryland Grace. The experience it leaves the listener with is absolutely brilliant. I could ignore many of the faults of the book, the plot because I was completely engrossed by the performance.</p>
<p>Sure, even the book is good. I can’t say the same for the writing. But who cares. There’s an innate charm with the way Weir writes his books. Or the way he structures his plot. There’s a lot of science that’s hard to swallow, at times almost at the verge of being stupid. Yet, it doesn’t come out as lazy to me. And I am not alone to feel so; Brandon Sanderson <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/project-hail-mary-review/">writes this in his review</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, what I love that Andy does is he shows that optimism can be compelling as a narrative. I don’t mind the grimdark movement. I think there’s lots of great books that have come out of it. And I like dystopian science fiction quite a bit. Some of my favorite stories are very depressing dystopian stories, such as Harrison Bergeron. But there is a certain electric-fun to optimism. And Andy Weir writes optimistic science fiction, optimistic hard science fiction, even when terrible things are happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I can word the way I feel about Weir’s writing any better. He did that successfully with Martian. And he outdoes himself by being even more audacious with Project Hail Mary.</p>
<p>The book gets four star from me. And an added star just for Roy. No surprise, it’s rated (almost) five star on Audible. Absolutely brilliant!</p>

			 <p>This week saw the schools and offices welcoming the students and employees in-person, and I realised I have entered the post-lockdown phase of the pandemic now. For a body and mind that has gotten used to the sluggish at-home routine, the rush-filled days are exhausting. I haven’t gotten used to this routine yet.</p>
<p>It isn’t as if I am working more. Rather, I must be working a lot less than what I was when I could focus more at home. For the majority of the times, that is. But the mere fact that I am at the office floors surrounded by the buzzing coworker space makes the stay tiring. I can see the same behaviour in my daughter. She was extremely pumped to join the school, and still is. However, even she is drained once she arrives home from the school. Well, her reason might be different – surrounded by friends new and old, she is bursting with energy. She has missed her classrooms. And the busy routine. There’s satisfaction on her tired face.</p>
<p>Is it all bad for me? Well, to be frank, not at all. I have enjoyed the company of coworkers in the last week. The way we work when we can interact face-to-face is very different from when it is all virtual. We take many decisions without planning and booking a time on the calendar; as a result, we close more discussions. The virtual mode of working restrained us through the need to over-plan. Over-schedule. It’s surprising how free I felt when I could simply walk to a person and talk.</p>
<p>Sure, the away-from-home routine has impacted my reading and writing habits, too. Well, to be frank, those habits are impacted for quite some time now. I need to get back, find a window to think in this hectic, unsteady life. It’s not new to me, but it’s funny how a couple of years at home has made me forget the office lifestyle. What was the work-life balance that we talked so much about, again?</p>
<p>Well, that’s a thought to ponder over some other time.</p>

			 <p>iPhone SE is a lazy upgrade — Apple is a boring company. If there is one thing that will dent the juggernaut that is Apple, it is their tendency to play safe to cater to the majority. <em>We need to sell in millions, so we can’t experiment too much on design.</em> I understand the why. Consumer aren’t supposed to care.</p>
<p>The strategy might work in US. Apple might throw numbers to prove that SE sells well worldwide. But all they are doing is to keep a manufacturing unit running since last 2014.</p>
<p>India is an extremely competitive market on price and I am tired of waiting for Apple to price their low end devices well.</p>
<p>SE needs a better, modern design. Be bold and make one custom for smaller devices. Or stay lazy and make iPhone 12 mini your new SE. Or if that&rsquo;s too premium, make iPhone 11 the new SE. But kill those bezels already.</p>

			 <p>I have recently been a lot picky about the stuff I buy. Or the subscriptions I sign up for. Or the projects I undertake. I was never good at it. And I don’t claim that I have mastered the skill now. I still struggle to recognise the price that I would eventually have to pay. First look, the listed cost looks cheap. But I have started asking now, “<a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2022/01/everything-must-be-paid-for-twice/">can I pay the second price</a>?”</p>
<p>The answer is usually <em>a big no</em>. David Cain succinctly words the reasons behind this problem of mine (the above linked essay is a must-read).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe this is one reason our modern lifestyles can feel a little self-defeating sometimes. In our search for fulfillment, we keep paying first prices, creating a correspondingly enormous debt of unpaid second prices. Yet the rewards of any purchase – the reason we buy it at all — stay locked up until both prices are paid.</p>

<p>I could also closely associate with the side effects of this problem, as David lists them. This made me acutely aware of the gravity of this pilling debt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This scarcity feeling creates one of the major side-effects of our insurmountable second-price debt: we reflexively overindulge in entertainment and other low-second-price pleasures –- phone apps, streaming services, and processed food — even though their rewards are often only marginally better than doing nothing. This stuff is attractive because it takes little effort (and we’re tired from working to pay for so many first prices) but it can eat up a ton of time, depleting the second-price budget even further.</p>

<p>The guiding philosophy is “Go deeper, not wider.” Drill down for value and enrichment instead of fanning out. You turn to the wealth of options already in your house, literally and figuratively.

			 <p>Whenever I wake my daughter up in the morning (thankfully, I don’t have to do it every day), she has this habit of pushing her face further deep into her pillow and just raising her one finger.

<p>It doesn’t matter for how long she has been in the bed. She may have slept a good 10 hours of good night’s sleep, she still has her finger up when I go and wake her up. It is the sleep that she gets in the extra minute that’s dear to her.</p>
<p>We love this little game of ours. When I <em>knowingly</em> wake her up early, and she <em>knowingly</em> raises her finger up. When that minute is up, I act tough and pull her out of the bed. She knows I am acting. I know she knows. Both of us wear a smug smile on our faces.</p>

			 <p>Last week was about hope and shattered dreams. It was a lesson in staying positive amidst all the roadblocks and pushbacks. It began with, on the personal front, hopes for a better, different tomorrow — but as the week drew closer to the end, I was made aware that there’s still a lot of work to do. That I am not “worthy” of this better tomorrow yet. I know I am. But after a point, all you can do is stay positive. Stay prepared for the time when the tide invariably will turn.</p>
<p>Staying prepared is all we did. I wish I could dwell more into details. But I cannot.</p>
<p>Talking about the week, my daughter had her culmination day in her school. She was already saddened that it was online, not in person. Online schooling has overstayed its welcome now; she longs to visit the physical school. She misses her friends and her routine when she is surrounded by a learning environment. Staring at a computer screen with teachers and friends peering back at her is not her definition of involved learning. I am proud of how effectively she has managed schooling for the past 2 years. But I feel for her.</p>
<p>Anyway, she had to talk about a topic which she prepared well for and yet was extremely nervous about. The ill-timed power loss and resultant network drop made it even more terrible experience for her than what she feared. She stayed positive, joined from an iPad with a mobile hotspot. She gave her best, but she had already lost half her interest. All I and my wife could do was to explain how it was nothing to get disheartened about, to make her look at the positives. But I knew deep down that she is no longer enjoying this digital form of schooling.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>This post was sent as an introduction for this week&rsquo;s issue of <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/subscribe/">my weekly newsletter</a>. I have realized the updates I begin my newsletter with every week get lost once it is out. So I publish these as individual posts.</p>

			 <p>Micro.blog is a blogging platform built over Hugo, a fast static site engine. Given the way it is structured, every theme created for Hugo can potentially work with the blog hosted by Micro.blog. However, there are a few aspects added to Hugo that are specific to the way things work in Micro.blog. These need to be included as part of the themes to make the most of the features of this platform.</p>
<p>This article presents a non-extensive list of things that should be evaluated and included while porting a theme that is made for Hugo to Micro.blog. I have written this as I dug into the existing themes <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/01/23/paper-a-clean.html">while porting Paper theme</a>. As of this writing, a theme is considered as a plug-in in Micro.blog. Hence, many references link back to the way plug-ins work with the platform.</p>
<p>To reiterate, this is not an extensive list. Based on how a theme, that is being ported, is set up, one may need only a few of these steps or may need a few more than those listed below. However, this should be a good start to get a working version of the theme out for testing. If there are any issues or concerns, please reply to our email addresses.</p>
<h2 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h2>
<p>Of course, the article assumes that you have already identified the theme that you want to port. The <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io">Hugo theme Showcase</a> is a good place to check for all the wonderful themes available.</p>
<p>Though you are not required to have a detailed understanding of Hugo to port a theme, the knowledge on the below aspects should be handy.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-themes/59">Custom Theme support in Micro.blog</a></li>
<li>A basic understanding of <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/">Hugo templates</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/">directory structure</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>The first step to get started is to access and clone the repository of the theme to be ported. You can either do this offline on your desktop or directly create a new theme in Micro.blog with mentioning the theme repository URL as Clone URL. You could then select this newly added theme as a custom theme for your <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/09/04/microblog-test-blogs.html">test blog</a>. This allows you to find out what breaks and also validate the additional modifications that you make to the theme.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2022/7fde8afe70.png" width="600" height="188" alt="" />
<p>For a theme to work, you only need a few folders and files — a typical Micro.blog theme directory structure is provided below for reference.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">.
├── theme.toml
├── config.json
├── plugin.json
├── layouts
└── static
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li><code>theme.toml</code> - Contains bare meta information about the theme, like name, description, license, features, author.</li>
<li><code>config.json</code> - Contains any properties required and referenced by the template files of the theme. If the property is to be provided by the user, typically it should be taken as a setting, defined in a separate file.</li>
<li><code>plugin.json</code> - Contains meta information about the custom theme to be displayed as part of plugin repository. It also defines the feature settings that can be provided by user while plugin configuration. Refer to <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/plug-ins/104">official guide on plug-ins</a> for more details about this file.</li>
<li><code>layouts</code> - A folder that stores <code>html</code> templates that defines how views of different content types will be rendered on a website with the style.</li>
<li><code>static</code> - A folder that stores all the static content like CSS, JavaScript, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get rid of all the other unnecessary files and folders and only keep the above-mentioned ones. This will keep the list of files in which changes are to be made manageable.</p>
<p>Before we move ahead, here’s a list of basic template files in the <code>layouts</code> folders that one would modify typically to port a theme.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/_default/list.html</code> - A template that renders pages with multiple pieces of content, this includes the homepage. A homepage can also be independently styled by defining a template <code>index.html</code> in the root directory.</li>
<li><code>/_default/single.html</code> or <code>posts/single.html</code> - A template that renders a page for a single post.</li>
<li><code>/_default/list.archivehtml.html</code> - A template that renders the archive page of your website.</li>
<li><code>/partials/head.html</code> - A template that defines the <code>head</code> section of your final rendered HTML.</li>
<li><code>/partials/header.html</code> - A template that defines the header of your blog. This typically includes the site title, subtitle, navigation menu etc.</li>
<li><code>/partials/footer.html</code> - A template that defines the footer of your blog. This typically includes the copyrights, author information etc.</li>
<li><code>/_default/baseof.html</code> - A base template that stitches all the above defined partials together, including the main sections defined in list and single template pages above.</li>
</ul>
<p>A theme might have all the above files, or have just a subset of these. In case a theme does not provide a particular template file, one from the basic theme (which forms the base of every theme) of Micro.blog is used.</p>
<p>Moreover, make sure you configure the appropriate Hugo Version to be used for your blog. Micro.blog allows two versions of Hugo to be used, 0.54 and 0.91, the latest being relatively new. Many themes may not work with the older 0.54 version of the Hugo, typically indicated by the <code>min_version</code> configuration in the <code>theme.toml</code>. If the value is above 0.54, set the Hugo version to be used as 0.91. This can be done via Design → Hugo Version.</p>
<h2 id="fix-the-broken-pages">Fix the Broken Pages</h2>
<p>Usually, the home page might not render the list of all the posts with the ported templates. This is often due to the wrong selection of the posts. To check the selection, visit the list template mentioned above and fix the file which is fetching all the posts. It should typically look like below where you pull all the regular pages where type is defined as post.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">{{ $pages = where .Site.RegularPages &#34;Type&#34; &#34;post&#34; }}
</code></pre></div><p>A similar fix would also need to be applied to the archive page’s template, if it is defined custom. The archive page would also need styling the components appropriately, as these are all Micro.blog specific classes, not part of the default styling of the theme.</p>
<p>Next, you will have to fix the templates to handle the title-less posts. Most posts published with Micro.blog are, well, micro-posts with no titles. So, wherever a Title is referenced, it should be wrapped in a <code>&amp;#123;&amp;#123; if .Title }}</code> condition. So, the title reference at every place should read like below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">{{ if .Title }}
	&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">h2</span>&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">h2</span>&gt;
{{ end }}
</code></pre></div><p>The title-less posts might also need minor styling fixes. A typical pitfall is when a post permalink is only available with title. So, a micro-post requires a different element to carry the permalink, mostly the date-time of the post.</p>
<p>Another aspect that is typically broken is rendering of the taxonomy. Most of the themes in Hugo use tags to define the taxonomy. Micro.blog uses categories and hence need to fetch them differently. So at every place a template mentions tags, mostly on list template, archives template and single template, replace them with categories. This primarily involves replacing all the references of <code>.Params.tags</code> with <code>.Params.categories</code>.</p>
<p>With these changes handled, you should have a working website that renders correctly. However, it is still not customised to include the benefits that Micro.blog brings to the table.</p>
<h2 id="add-microblog-specific-tags">Add Micro.blog Specific Tags</h2>
<p>Micro.blog packs the key IndieWeb principles, like IndieAuth, MicroPub, Webmentions, out-of-box for all websites hosted with the platform. However, this does involve defining a few relevant aspects at appropriate places. In addition, the platform is also rich in the ways a user not adept with coding can customise their website to their liking, with support for providing custom CSS, footer and plug-ins. Enabling these also need relevant components to be defined.</p>
<p>The changes to be made are in two files. First, modify the partials template that defines the head section of your website, <code>/partials/head.html</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">link</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">rel</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;stylesheet&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;{{ &#34;</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">custom</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">css</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">&#34;</span> <span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">|</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">relURL</span> <span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">}}?{{</span> <span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">Site</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">Params</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">theme_seconds</span> <span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">}}&#34;</span>&gt;

<p>The difficulty involved in porting a Hugo theme to Micro.blog depends completely on the complexity of the original theme. Though it is difficult to extensively cover all the changes required, fixing the things that are broken and adding support for the Micro.blog specific features and tags is all it takes. This article attempted to list down the majority of the identified changes.</p>
<p>In the future, the way of including the Micro.blog specific changes may be simplified significantly. This article would be updated accordingly to reflect the same. However, the awareness of the changes being done allows one to appreciate the hidden complexity and beauty of the platform that is Micro.blog.</p>

			 <p>I find <a href="https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/historyculture/douglas-corrigan.htm">the story of Douglas Corrigan</a> pretty fascinating and inspiring. Sometimes the wrong way is the right way. All that matters is your intention and people’s perception.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having flown his nine year-old, $900 Curtiss Robin to New York, Corrigan fueled up and took off after announcing that he planned to return to Los Angeles. When next heard from, Corrigan and his old plane were in Dublin, Ireland, where he said, &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Corrigan. I left New York yesterday morning headed for California, but I got mixed up in the clouds and must have flown the wrong way.&rdquo; And so was born the wry legend of &ldquo;Wrong Way&rdquo; Corrigan.</p>

			 <p>I am on a #30day challenge of not accessing any of the social timelines and have signed out from them in all my browsers. I will continue to post to my blog, and hence cross-post to Twitter. But to aid myself to stay away from timeline, I won’t access the mention page either. So, no replies.</p>
<p>I want to understand what impact the timelines have on my focus — I have been struggling with that since the last few months. It’s time to take some action.</p>
<p>Are social media timelines the only cause? I’m sure they are not. But my intension is to find out if they are <em>one of the causes</em> and to what extent.</p>
<p>I do intend to catch up on the blog feeds though, and for the next 30 days, I will have to use emails to both send the responses. You, too, can send any responses to my posts <a href="mailto:reply@amitgawande.com">through email here</a>.</p>

			 <p>I have settled on a platform for my blog which works the best for me — Micro.blog. There are reasons why the other platforms don&rsquo;t interest me. And I want to talk about them. Why now, you say? Well, recent and sudden interest in the Write.as platform among the folks I follow the words from made me momentarily pause. So here&rsquo;s the write up, first on why what in Micro.blog works for me.</p>
<p>For starter, it suits well for both the micro and long-form posts. It has apps for all platforms that I primarily use Mac and Android (Web is good for Windows, though I would still love an app there). Quick notes are best made with the apps, especially so from smartphone. For such posts that are long, titled, Ulysses works perfectly well for me. No other CMS can ever work as well as a native application.</p>
<p>The platform is built on Hugo. And I <em>love</em> Hugo. I hosted my blog for the longest with Hugo. I love the submodule systems with Hugo. Building extensions in your templates is so easy, and I have gotten comfortable with it. For a few, it might be <code>PHP</code> and WordPress. However, I could never get comfortable with that.</p>
<p>Manton has added just enough around Hugo to make it even more useful — the APIs, the apps, the social aspects, the open plug-in and theming systems and, the most valuable, its community. I visit the platform for inspiration, and many posts start right there. All this makes Micro.blog a lot more powerful, getting rid of the issues I had with Hugo, mainly the editing workflow with the static site. And I am not even talking about the smarter features life filters, bookmarks, microcasts, newsletters and bookshelves.</p>
<p>Do I use all of them? Of course, not. But the fact that one plan provides me so much over and above the basic blogging functionality is priceless for me.</p>
<h3 id="but-what-about-other-platforms">But what about other platforms?</h3>
<p>I have hopped through a lot more platforms than what I am proud of. So, I know what works, and doesn’t work for me. Let me be brief and focus only on what doesn’t work for me with the most frequently talked ones. I don’t want to consider the costing aspects — I can work a way to use them so that they cost effectively the same.</p>
<p>The below notes also give me a ready reference when I get lured by a new platform next time.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress</a> is too busy, too bloated for my liking. I don’t like the CMS. I don’t like the themes. For my style of blogging, frequent quick posts than scheduled thought-out essays, the options and features become a hinderance. I don’t want to think about the title or the tags or the categories or the url. Or excerpt. Sure, I can customise this system just to get it right. But I don’t know (neither do I like) <code>PHP</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> blog looks pretty. Polished. Majority of my posts aren’t that. And again, it bundles too many features that I just can’t connect with. I am not a media publishing house trying to build a business with my blog. I am a dumb person with very basic needs. No “audience”. No business.</p>
<p><a href="https://blot.im">Blot</a> is brilliant. Another of those services I have a lot of love for, driven also from my respect to David, the mind behind the service. A brilliant guy, just like his service. But my editing workflow is just not files driven. When I write, I don’t always do that in my text editor. I want a web editor. I want apps. And, having said that, I also want text editors. Not something that Blot supports currently. For some, that’s the ultimate selling point of the service. Not for me.</p>
<p>What about <a href="http://write.as/">Write.as</a>, the recent entrant? Well, I like the service. I like the simplicity of the editor (I wish Manton got inspired from this one). But it feels far too fragmented. Each feature is a different product. I had noted this recently about the service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I land on a page which is a blank one with a blinking cursor. Brilliant! But what next? There&rsquo;s nothing else if you don&rsquo;t know where to go. I can see my blog posts, edit them. Do you want the community? There is a different product. Pictures you say? That&rsquo;s another different product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The workflow is not natural to me. It is a nice, easy service. But it doesn’t work for me. Plus, it lacks the app support. Without mobile apps, I just can’t publish those quick notes anymore.</p>
<p>Of course, I could pick and choose, make multiple platforms host different types of posts for me. I have done that. But I have realised, after a lot of pain, that it’s another hurdle in my posting workflow. Any decision my mind is to make before publishing slows it down, killing my writing productivity completely.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it’s a wonderful time to be blogging again. There’s such a rich set of platforms that can suit every writer’s style. For me, though, Micro.blog works the best, and I am going to stick with it for now. Does that mean I will <em>never</em> consider new or even the above platforms? Well, knowing me, I can never say never.</p>

			 <p>Last week, my whole family, near and distant, got together for my cousin’s wedding, and it kept me completely exhausted throughout this week. The venue for the wedding was unfamiliar to me and I am never comfortable at such places. I can never settle into any routinue of sorts, messing up my eating and sleeping habits, and invariably my body. The journey with a train to and from the destination, though, was wonderful. I have always had a fascination for the train rides, especially ones overnight. To be a resident of a world on wheels for a few hours is welcome — it distances you from all your regular thoughts. Each station the train halts at exhibits a different personality, lays out its own unique beauty for the traveling strangers. The <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/02/05/a-morning-during.html">skies in the dawns remain beautiful</a>, the vacant stations late at nights are equally mesmerising.</p>
<img src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2022/journey-in-the-night.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" /> 
<p>All said, notwithstanding the tiredness the event left me with, the train ride gave me enough memories to remember the two nights of the journey by. The week also saw me complete another of my <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/categories/30-day/">#30day</a> challenges. I am proud of this one, I learned so much. And I might have continued the challenge if it wasn’t for the hectic week. I will not, however, take photo-a-day as a challenge now. I want to make it regular, part of my blogging habit.</p>
<p>What #30day challenge should I sign up for next, then? Anyway, last week was a slow writing week in terms of number of posts. But in terms of number of words, I wrote more than what’s usual for me.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Respected Mr. Gaitonde,</p>
<p>I have reached Tikwadi. As I had promised you in our last meeting when you had unnecessarily criticised me for the lack of seriousness, I have taken this job extremely seriously. Let me be extremely clear; your ultimatum that if I do not work sensibly very soon will lead to me losing my job had nothing to do with the deftness with which I have decided to travel.</p>
<p>Anyway, things are absolutely fine here in Tikwadi. There have been no untoward events until now. I think the villagers had unnecessarily raised an alarm. A day comes. The night follows. And days go by so without anything eventful happening. No murders, no aliens, no ghosts. Not that I am afraid of any of these. For that matter, I do not even believe in such laughable charades.</p>
<p>Overall, the town is beautiful. The people are also beautiful. Not the women &ndash; I mean, I am not saying the women are not beautiful. I mean, that does not matter to me. Undoubtedly, though, each one is uniquely crazy. Again, not that it matters much to me &ndash; I mean, the job matters to me. But the fact that the town is batshit crazy does not affect me.</p>
<p>I hope you know what I mean. I will report when something eventful happens. The people are waiting for me for a game of cricket. Football is with me.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity you gave me. Agent Raghu signing off.</p>
<hr>
<p>Dear Gaitonde,</p>
<p>Here I am, reporting to you again from Tikwadi. I will be very crisp this time, as you had said in your letter. I know I wrote numerous unnecessary things in my letter the last time. But my only intention was to let you know how normal the things were. There wasn’t any other hidden agenda. I won’t say your quip that “you are not on a picnic there” did not hurt me. It did … I mean just a bit. Not enough to impact my job. You can be assured about that.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the town does not seem as normal as I had reported the last time. There have been some sightings. Or so the crazy, frightened villagers say. I &ndash; let me assure you again &ndash; am not afraid at all. Just to be absolutely safe, I am just avoiding going to the areas from where the sightings have been reported. It is not because I am afraid. It is just to make sure you continue to get the reports from Tikwadi that you so dearly look out for. If something, anything, happens to me, I do not think it would be straightforward to find an equally qualified agent. I know you told me the last time to not call myself that. But this time it is not the post I am referring to. I use it as a common noun, and it is in that respect I call myself an agent. I am sure the kind heart of yours wouldn’t mind that.</p>
<p>Anyway, there is nothing to get very excited or scared about. Sure, the villagers are lunatic. I have no second thought in my mind about that. Furthermore, the town is not at all beautiful; it is miserable rather. The streetlights have no lights in them. The fans leak more noise than the air. Of course, both are true when there is electricity. Can you do something about these power cuts? I know I am an essential part of your team, and you respect me immensely. So, I am sure you would do that much for me. On a positive note, nature is, no doubt, beautiful. And some people are beautiful, beautiful as in not crazy. I only talk to these people regularly. I want to make sure I do not lose my smartness here.</p>
<p>Anyway, I will keep reporting if there are any more sightings or events. Gauri is calling me. She is beautiful. I mean, not that it matters to me.</p>
<p>Signing off. Raghu.</p>
<hr>
<p>Gaitonde,</p>
<p>I hate you. Why the bloody fuck did you send me to this idiot town. I am no agent. You should have told me that in extremely clear terms. “You are not an agent, but only our representative” is not clear enough. I checked the Webster dictionary; one of the synonyms of agents is “representative”, you moron.</p>
<p>I do not know if it is the town that makes people crazy here, or it is the people who make this town crazy. The dimwits continue to run at me wherever they see me with the reports of the sightings. Some see ghosts. Some see aliens. The idiots tell me the most terrifying tales and leave me alone. They do not even realise I need to live alone after they go.</p>
<p>There is nothing worth reporting from this windswept town. Have you ever seen a ghost, Gaitonde? I am sure you won’t know if you have; because they bloody look the same. The Gauri I mentioned in my last letter? They tell me there never was any Gauri in the town. I was naively planning to propose to her very soon; of course, once I complete this job for you. Now I don&rsquo;t even know who is real and who is ghostly. I keep getting slapped as I pull on their moustaches and their hair, just to confirm.</p>
<p>I am done being your agent. Call me back. If you can’t get electricity to this town, a request that you so mercilessly thwarted, at least get me a car.</p>
<p>Raghu</p>

<p>And shopping for the eyeglass frame then is <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2018/10/07/131400.html">shopping</a> <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2019/10/05/234000.html">for fashion</a>, which I have no sense for. What I like, I am told, doesn’t look good on me. It’s either too big. Or too small. What I am told looks good, I am not comfortable wearing that. Tired, I purchase one from whatever remains. <em>What are clothes for if not just for covering my body</em>, my brain consoles my crying mind each time.</p>
<p>That’s how my shopping for a frame for my glasses goes. <em>What is the frame for if not just for holding the lenses within</em>.</p>

			 <p>I have settled onto an easy workflow for publishing newsletters with Micro.blog. Another issue for <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/subscribe/">Excursions Weekly</a> went out today and the editing process was the most frictionless till date. I do wish though that there was an archive of the issues that I could share with the subscribers so that they know what they are signing up for.</p>
<p>Also, unfortunately the issue with the replies bouncing back has still not been fixed. Without that, I have no way to connect with the readers.</p>
<p>The way things stand, the support for newsletter in Micro.blog is extremely bare today. But the workflow remains one that I am most comfortable with. I just wish a few things were different and better.</p>

			 <p>I have been busy tinkering with many things these last few days. I don’t like when this happens because I halt everything else. I don’t read — that invariably leads to me writing less. My routine is completely messed up. <em>No early to bed and early to rise</em>. I stay awake unnecessarily, and when I eventually sleep, it is with a mind full of thoughts, working on stuff yet undone. No surprise, the sleep is not peaceful.</p>
<p>I cozy up to all the bad habits. No control on eating or control on my smartphone usage. Every good habit that was picked up is forgotten again. Yikes!</p>
<p>I find it curious that being productive mars my health more often. I need to learn to shut myself down on time. Learn to say no to additional work, notwithstanding the fun I am having.</p>

			 <p>I have released a new <strong>version 1.0.2</strong> of the <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/43">Paper theme</a> today, which addresses the reported issues and suggestions <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/01/23/paper-a-clean.html">since the first release yesterday</a>. Here are the changes, in brief.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support to include replies on individual posts</li>
<li>Added the configuration of social icons as plug-in setting</li>
<li>Updated the styling to display categories along with posts</li>
<li>Updated documentation to include installation steps</li>
<li>Fixed styling of images on smaller screens</li>
</ul>
<p>You can go to the Plug-ins section in Micro.blog and click “Upgrade” once the option is available. You will have to reconfigure (<em>for the last time, hopefully</em>) the social IDs in the settings of the plug-in. No need to modify the <code>config.json</code>, anymore. This also means the configurations will not be lost during the future upgrades.</p>
<p>I am thrilled with all the feedback that I have received. Paper is a beautifully designed theme, something I can take no credit for. At the same time, I am glad I could make it simpler for others to adopt it.</p>

			 <p>After playing around briefly to understand how to bring a theme made for Hugo to Micro.blog, I have finally ported one that I love. Today, I am ready to share it with the Micro.blog community. The theme is called <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/43">Paper</a> and goes with a tagline “simple, clean, flexible”. You can check for yourself in the screenshot below, or see it live at <a href="https://amit-test.micro.blog">my test blog</a>.</p>
<img src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/static.amitgawande.com/images/2022/paper-screenshot.png" width="760" height="404" alt="" />
<p>I am a big fan of clean themes that are minimal, yet impressive. Paper is one such theme — I had used it earlier when I was hosting this blog with Hugo. Although it looks minimal, it isn’t so in the way it works. It has a simple, yet signature header, a built-in dark mode support with a beautiful toggle and a clean <em>black &amp; white</em> look.</p>
<p>I have added the first version of this theme to the plug-ins directory so that you can <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/43">install it directly as a plugin</a>. <del>It works with both Hugo versions that Micro.blog supports (0.54 and 0.91)</del> [<strong>Update</strong>]: An issue was reported while using the theme with Hugo version 0.54. <note>So, until further update, the theme supports only version 0.91 of Hugo</note>. However, here are a few points to remember before you install the theme.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uninstall any theme that you have installed as a plugin. Set you current theme to blank and Hugo Version to 0.91 in the design section of your blog. Make sure there are no other conflicting custom CSS configured for the previous theme. Then install the Paper theme from the plugin directory. Once the theme is successfully installed, you can configure the social icons displayed in the header by modifying the available options in <code>config.json</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s already a brilliant selection of themes available for Micro.blog and I am excited to see the support grow further with every passing day. I hope you like this and a few folks benefit from it. If you do, I would love to hear from you.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Everything, some might say. But such barbs might not help identify and address the core issue.</p>
<p>For the past few days, I have read a lot of posts where people describe why they are quitting social media — Facebook, Instagram, and the peskiest of all, Twitter; I empathise with the stories they are narrating. The wasted hours or the effects of doom-scrolling or an overall sense of negativity, helplessness. Colin Devroe <a href="http://cdevroe.com/2022/01/05/bye-social-media/">describes well</a> how these platforms have affected his ability to focus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]hen I’m still, when I’m idle, when I feel like I could be bored at any moment I grab my phone and scroll through Twitter which sends my mind into overdrive on a million topics, timelines, thoughts, and emotions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I get all of that. But my train of thoughts takes a slightly different turn, and I am left pondering what exactly do I find problematic about social media platforms.</p>
<p>Is it the timeline? If that’s the case, why is YouTube a concern? Is it the recommendations feed? If that’s the case, why is the chronological timeline on Twitter still pesky? Is it the trends? Well, why is the curated Instagram an issue? None of these is problematic in isolation. The effect that all of them put together have on me is the concern.</p>
<h3 id="passive-consumption-hurts-me-more">Passive consumption hurts me more</h3>
<p>I have realised that social media platforms lead users towards passive consumption. They benefit from their ability to make meaningless interactions pleasing. Or at least engaging. All the concerns I have stem from this “user-engagement-at-all-cost” business practice. Irrespective of how pleasing this interaction feels in the moment, it leaves me furious for the time wasted.</p>
<p>Twitter timeline is prone to do that. YouTube homepage does that, and so does their recommendation engine. Instagram, Facebook feeds do that. For me, even the Reddit forums tend to do that. Debatable, but <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2018/10/15/230500.html">Podcasts do that</a> too. And to top it all, my smartphone does this to the worst effect.</p>
<p>In short, meaningless interactions with any service or device is a problem. Passive consumption it leads to leaves me exhausted, feeling shit.</p>
<p>That is why a community like Micro.blog is not generally on such lists. The timeline component of Micro.blog, even though Manton has designed it to be different from Twitter and its ilk, is social media. But given the nature of the community, the interactions tend to inspire me to create, to act. Be opposite of passive. Even then, the timeline on my smartphone still causes me to waste time. It makes me pull down incessantly, subconsciously, and refresh. To check for more posts to interact with. <em>The pull-down-to-refresh has to be the most unhealthy use of our thumbs.</em></p>
<p>I had this issue identified some time back. It quit the social media that was useless to me, Facebook. I put control on those I use, Micro.blog and Twitter. It is their hunger to make me mindlessly scroll that I had to stifle. Most often, they do that via their apps on my smartphones. So, they don’t get space on my phone anymore. I access all the timelines on my computer. I follow the RSS feeds for many blogs to avoid visiting the timelines frequently.</p>
<h3 id="not-a-problem-for-all">Not a problem for all</h3>
<p>That said, I don’t judge others who continue to benefit from social media platforms. Get happiness out of using some or all of them. What’s hollow for me might be meaningful for them. This thought was one of the reasons I didn’t post when I quit social media for the first time. I wanted to avoid sounding preachy. Plus, the resolve to not use the platforms at all didn’t last for long anyway. I share the dilemma that Cheri puts down in <a href="https://hypertext.monster/2021/07/17/no-social-media.html">her brilliant essay</a> aptly named No Social Media Club.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My feelings are true to me, but I don’t want others to feel judged for what they choose to do. There was a time when our messier feelings were shared in certain contexts. At home. With family. With friends. With a therapist. Not online. Not like this. Not where someone who recently shared a donut photo might feel momentarily stung by my essay. You see my dilemma, no? What is currently truth for me might be a hurtful barb to someone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely. I am no one to judge other people’s choices. In response, they might judge me for such posts I write on my blog that I have no clue if anyone is reading at all. I have no likes or re-shares to show for them. I do this because I get clarity, happiness out of writing this, sharing this. As they say, you do you.</p>
<p>In short, in the strictest sense, I am not “quitting” social media. It’s not the platforms in themselves that I have a problem with. Any interaction that leads me to consume meaninglessly, passively or makes me feel shit is what I am quitting.</p>

			 <p>I am happy with the second issue of <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/subscribe/">the weekly newsletter</a> that I sent out today. The <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/01/03/styling-newsletter-digests.html">minimal styling</a> that I had recommended last week seems to have helped it. Sure, it was still some work to restructure a few things. But it was worth it. I also fixed a few minor issues.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>“Do what you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life,” goes a mantra for success – an adage that is unfortunately overrated, though. A person can’t always do what she loves to do. Rather, there are very few fortunate folks who do just what they want to do in their life. An extension to that adage is <em>love what you do</em>. Well, nor can one always love what she does. Rather, most folks hate what they do. They do it because they <em>have to</em> do it.</p>
<p>“Passion is the genesis of genius,” says Tony Robbins. Aha, that is precisely the reason we aren’t surrounded by geniuses. The majority of us are stuck doing something for which we have no passion.</p>
<p>That is such a cynical attitude, you say? Sure. But, it also is the reality of our world. Should we then give up? Far from that, actually. What one should do is to find out <em>why</em> they are doing what they are doing. For some, it might be the money. Or a sense of comfort. For many, it might be the best among the available options. Find peace with what you do. That is the first step to reach a phase in your life when you can do what you love to do.</p>
<p>There is also the fact that what you love can very well be temporary. It takes time to find your passion. What you think is your passion may very well be a fleeting interest. As Derek Sivers <a href="#">reminds us</a>, we can’t always depend on our current opinions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Our) former self is not always right. We shouldn’t preserve our first opinions as if they reflect our pure, untarnished, true nature. They’re often just the result of inexperience or a temporary phase. Old opinions shouldn’t define who we are in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the contentedness, though passing, that matters the most. Do what makes you feel contented, what gives you a good night’s sleep.</p>
<p>That said, there is, of course, another way. Stick to what you are passionate about. Switch paths when your passion changes. There will be hardships because doing what <em>you think</em> you love is not easy. But being satisfied never is. Be firm, stay strong.</p>
<p>So, which way do you prefer?</p>

			 <p>What is a productive day? Well, when it is closer to your bedtime, and you feel good inside for the day gone by, you have had a productive day. It doesn’t matter then how much you achieved in the day. Or how many of the planned tasks you ticked off. What matters is how the waking hours make you feel.</p>
<p>Plans are like the lane markings on the roads. It is beneficial to stick to them, follow guidelines around them. But often <em>to move ahead</em>, you have to put on the indicators and cross over such markers. You can’t let them become hinderances that slow you down, hold you back.</p>
<p>Plan. But move ahead.</p>

			 <p>Ben wrote <a href="https://werd.io/2022/everyone-should-blog">a wonderful post</a> suggesting, <em>reminding</em>, that everyone should blog, should write. I always connect, and have done so for long, with this specific sentiment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s no such thing as writing too much: your voice is important, your perspective is different, and you should put it out there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminded me of <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2018/02/13/215000.html">a post I had written</a> that shared a similar sentiment — we all can, and should, write. This particular passage that I had written, unfortunately, still holds true for many.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s saddening to see people resist the efforts to pen the words they think of. They go after what others have written, beautiful nevertheless, but at the cost of it being not real, fake. They underestimate the power of conveying one’s own feelings in whichever way possible. The words, their structure won’t matter much then. And that is one way one can start writing.</p>

			 <p>I recently changed the newsletter to a weekly digest instead of every long-form posts with Micro.blog. A fixed schedule is better for me than thinking about whether to include as part of the newsletter every time I post a post with a title. Until there is a better control (via categories) on what posts I can schedule for delivery, I want to avoid risking this particular setting.</p>
<p>That said, I didn’t really like the way the first digest looked. It was… mhmm … messy. Maybe a bit more control over the elements, like title etc. would be good. Without that, to make the digest look slightly better, here’s the custom CSS that I have added currently.</p>

Prone to miss at least a day occasionally, a streak of any kind is always difficult for me. Plus, a good thing is that I didn’t have to schedule any posts just to make sure I don’t skip a day. I had written all the posts on the day they are visible on the blog. Well, in Indian Standard Time, that is. Even the long-form essays.</p>
<p>With post-a-day done, can I take up another 30-day challenge? I always wanted to post at least a picture every day. But, I am not too much into photography. Or rather, I am not good at it. Plus the worsening environment outside with Omicron in the air, it becomes a tad more difficult to find different places every day. What else?</p>

<p>Since my niece was born on this day three years ago today, the new year celebrations have been quite unfamiliar for us. The whole world celebrates along with us as she grows a year old, every year. Or so we have convinced her and her parents. This year is no different, albeit a tad muted. But still, the folks all-around plan to celebrate.</p>
<p>Knowing how all my plans for 2020 were mercilessly crushed by the pandemic, I had no expectations from 2021. I knew it was going to be more of the same dreadful cycle of panic, despair, and hope. At the same time, I also wished I and all my dear ones sail through, see the end of the year.</p>
<p>As I sit here today, looking at the year gone by, all I can do is smile. It began with a phase as dark as my family had ever seen. But it brought us all close, gave us the courage to stay strong. We got back on our feet, stronger. We learned to live with the virus, masked whenever outside. Vaccinating ourselves. Slowly, gradually, we wandered, unhesitant, outside our homes. Each one of us established our own new rules, routines, and traditions around travel.</p>
<p>We met our friends, got nostalgic for the days that we had left behind. We got hungry, got drunk and laughed our hearts out. I witness my office welcome my colleagues, the floors, and pantries reverberating with grumbles again.</p>
<p>I am fortunate I could do all of that. And a lot more. That I watch my crazy friends share their plans for celebrations with booze and snacks. That I would watch the skies light up with fireworks one more time. I am fortunate that I am about to get ready and join my family to celebrate my niece growing older by another year.</p>
<p>And if you are reading this, know that, in one way or the other, you are too. Just look back and find out why.</p>
<p>Resilience. And <em>kismet</em>. The two words I would remember 2021 by. Wish you a happy new year, you all!</p>

			 <p>It has been the third day in a row today that I decided to sleep early, get back to routine and failed. I just can’t stop myself from doing what I am doing at my system. Until last week, I used to lay down onto my bed with my Kindle and was sound sleep at the same time every time. That hasn’t been the case for this part few days.</p>
<p>I know what I need to do. I can’t make myself do it. Sure, I have my reasons why I am going late to bed. Nonetheless, I don’t like that a bit.</p>
<p>Sleep routine is a flaky thing — disturb it ever so slightly, and it absolutely falls apart. And takes down the whole next day with it.</p>

			 <p>I decided against <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/12/29/an-inner-monologue.html">replacing my theme</a> with something entirely new. I have too many custom components baked in currently that <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/09/09/interesting-but-i.html">I don’t have time</a> to replicate afresh. Plus, all the feedback from folks helped me convince myself that what I have is good enough.</p>
<p>But, I have refreshed a few aspects in the existing theme. As advised by Khalid, I started with a typeface and replaced it with a serif one. It looks a lot bolder to me. A few clean-ups around accent colours. And a lot of moving stuff around.</p>
<p>What I have, thus, is something that looks different, yet is the same. The journey is incomplete yet, there are many ugly corners that need clean-up. But I will get to those as time permits.</p>

			 <p>An inner monologue around my site’s theme to follow. I have grown bored by looking at my current theme. Not that I don&rsquo;t like it, it just needs a reset. This has been how the site looks for a couple of years now. It looks so bland. Not playful. Not <em>personal</em>. There is no character.</p>
<p>Over the year, I have added so much stuff to the theme. It does not, at all, resemble what I started with. It feels hacky all around. I have realised I can’t create anything polished, so I prefer not to build something totally custom. I prefer anything that comes ready-made. But that’s tricky as these are still early days for theming with Micro.blog. I like a couple, but neither is perfect. Shall I start with one and personalise in limit? Do I want to take the project up?</p>
<p>I know, I know. “It is the words that matter and not what’s around.” &amp; “Make the content beautiful, not the container” &amp; blah blah.</p>
<p>I get it. That’s the writer in me speaking. But <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/08/16/i-am-a.html">the developer in me</a> is craving for change. Can I hold him back?</p>

Simple, yet so poignant. I wish I could live my life being aware of this somewhere at the back of mind. It’s not the most efficient way to get the results every time. Being cognisant however that halting is an option always helps.</p>
<p>Our society does not look at “giving up” respectfully. Especially if one does so without being successful. But cashing out early, accepting the failure, is always a sensible option.</p>
<p>Giving up early is problematic. But hanging on just to delay the inevitable is foolish.</p>

			 <p>I love emails, sending and receiving them. In today’s world of social timelines where you shout into a void and expect an echo back, the medium of email feels a lot more personal. Drafting a long email to a friend today reminded me of the time when I wrote letters to my family, a few pages long. When we carefully selected and penned the words to convey the emotions we were living through. Physical letters were replaced by their digital form, the email, but the manner we communicated didn’t change.</p>
<p>With email, there’s no urgency, no pressure of read receipts and associated expectations for response. And when the response does arrive, there’s a feeling of connectedness. Instant messages, those words we spurt in burst, don’t exude that sense of affinity. A well-thought email does; it makes you mindful of the fact that someone cares.</p>
<p>One is a letter, another is messaging. It’s unfortunate that we have forgotten how to draft the former. I wish I knew more people who shared my liking for this medium.</p>

<p>If we publish a post, we still haven’t participated in a social community we are part of. If we finish reading a book, we still haven’t read those newsletters or RSS feeds.</p>
<p>If we complete a task list at the office pending for weeks, we still haven’t spent enough time with our child. And the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>To everything that we do, there is always something we haven’t. Time is like a balancing scale. When balanced, more things are not on it than there are. To add anything to such a scale, we need to remove something first. The heavier the thing we put in, the more we extract.</p>
<p>We are balancing our time day in, day out. Acknowledging that we can’t do it all on a given day, we have to let a few things off our schedule for later. Why, then, ruin our days with something we didn’t do rather than celebrate it for something we did?</p>

			 <p>Now that there is a better support for drafts and scheduling posts in Micro.blog web interface, I can’t believe it didn’t exist till now.

			 <p>I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/12/10/after-a-welcome.html">recently cribbed</a> about how my smartphone was becoming the pesky little distractor again. I was planning to go back into a shell, keeping the device away from me for longer durations. However, I realised I may change the way and try being mindful this time.</p>
<p>I was hit by this thought during my guided meditation session today, when I came across this insightful observation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In trying to bend our will to that which is helpful, we strengthen our ego. In letting go of the things that are unhelpful, we free ourselves of our ego. Same intention. Different outcome.</p>
<p>We depend on our willpower to control our situation. We achieve the results but don’t train our minds. As a result, we harden our habits and behaviour. What if we change our approach. What if we acknowledge the unhealthy thought. But rather than becoming more rigid, we become softer. Rather than rejecting, resisting, we let go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting. I tend to depend on my willpower to not fall for the poor habits. That hasn’t worked well for me — I avoid the habits for some time, but soon am back to natural poor state. My problems with my smartphone are an example of this behaviour. So, why not accept that my device is a bugger? Be mindful of the fact that my subconscious reaches out for the device frequently. And when it does, acknowledge it and let it go.</p>
<p>Be mindful of the attraction, but not be burdened by willing self into resistance. Remind self of the negative outcome and detach. Can I train my mind to not fall for the attraction but ignore it naturally?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One approach is rigid, based on will, based on control. Other approach is based on awareness. Recognising the thoughts that are helpful and engaging with them. Recognising the thoughts that are unhelpful and letting them go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no idea if this would work for me. Who do I trust more, my willpower or my ability to be mindful? I have seen my willpower falter. Maybe I should give mindfulness a try this time. That’s what I have decided to do.</p>

			 <p>I love Pringles <em>crisps</em>. But the way they stack up, I could never eat them in a bunch — I feel guilty to eat more. As if I am emptying the can sooner and denying others of this wonderful cooked Potato. Fascinating how the container impacts your behaviour. Equally fascinating is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pringles#History">the history of this brand of snacks</a>. For example, the attempt was “to develop a new kind of potato chips to address consumer complaints about broken, greasy, and stale chips, as well as air in the bags”.</p>
<p>Well, chips haven’t changed much. And they didn’t even want to — as if they wanted to make the greasiness their identity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The product was originally known as Pringles Newfangled Potato Chips, but other snack manufacturers objected, saying Pringles failed to meet the definition of a potato &ldquo;chip&rdquo; since they were made from a potato-based dough rather than being sliced from potatoes like &ldquo;real&rdquo; potato chips.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the technicality aside (yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_paraboloid">the shape of the crisp</a> has a name), they just don’t taste like chips. They are different. And yet, “no one can eat just one”.</p>

			 <p>After a welcome phase of independence from my smartphone, I am back to fidgeting unnecessarily with the device. I keep it close to me when I shouldn’t. Notifications have started pestering me again. They hack my focus away. I know the reason, I have given up on my resolve to not hand over the control. It didn’t happen instantaneously. It happened gradually, over time. Now I feel the burning sensation like a slowly boiling frog.</p>
<p>There was a time when I used to go to any extends to stay away from the device. Keep it in the next room. No apps. No notifications. <em>Never</em> next to the bed. YouTube disabled. And on and on. Eventually, every time I picked it, a bulb lighted in my brain reminding me to not surrender.</p>
<p>And the pesky device conquered those defences one by one, without me realising. It started with a few apps. Then their notifications. Then a need to watch and share a YouTube video from the device. Before I realised, I was wishing good night to my phone lying in the bed.</p>
<p>Today, I was on my computer, the powerful personal computer which can cater to all my commands. But I reached out, as if out of habit, to the smartphone just to peek at those apps, the web versions of which I had just visited. I knew I was sick again.</p>
<p>My smartphone has become the most personal thing I own, but also the one I need to frequently stay away the farthest from.</p>

			 <p>As much as I love Ghost as a blogging platform, I hate maintaining an additional platform. I needed to keep it on because it provided a wonderful way to deliver newsletters as an extension to a regular blog.

I use Ulysses for all forms of writing, and <em>I love it</em>.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/12/07/an-easy-upgrade.html">Micro.blog supporting the email newsletters</a>, I can <em>again</em> bring all my writing to a single place.

			 <p>Assuming Manton is <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/12/04/putting-the-final.html">about to announce</a> some way of emailing posts or digest of post to the subscribers of Micro.blog hosted blogs, here’s how I wish it works. Email is just another cross-posting option. I know it’s tricky, and it will not work that way given Micro.blog, as timeline, also supports feeds from external blogging hosts. But here’s how I hope it works for it to be useful for me.</p>
<p>The writer selects a category (or a group of categories) for emailing. The posts she publishes under those categories are emailed to the subscribers. Subscribers decide whether they want an email for every post or for a digest of the posts (on a defined schedule — daily, weekly).</p>
<p>This would be a good start, everything else can come later. I have no idea if this is even a feature Manton is working on. But he says it’s “totally unique”. So, I am hoping it works very different from typical newsletter services.</p>

			 <p>I am back to using Mach3 by Gillette. Having tried everything, this razor still gives me the most comfortable shave. I don’t love money-hungry tactics of Gillette, but am glad they made this model.</p>
<p>There was a time when I used single blade safety razors. When Gillette launched the dual-blade razors. I thought <em>it’s double the blades, this has to be better</em>. It wasn’t. Later, I could finally <em>afford</em> Mac3, and I used it for the longest period of time. There was no need to shift, it suited me.</p>
<p>Then the craze for Indie, hip brands with products targeting “bros” engulfed India too. Search for a razor on Amazon and you will be bombarded with a slew of funnily named brands selling grooming products for mens. All claimed quality and affordability. Most targeted Gillette. Feeling burdened with guilt of not supporting newer brands, I switched. I started using a 5 blade razor from one such brand. And then kept hopping for a couple of years. Razor shopping soon became a hobby, and then slowly turned into a nightmare.</p>
<p>Eventually, I gave up and went back to Gillette. First to their pricey 5-blade razors and finally to Mach3. I realised something after this period. A razor with more blades doesn’t always mean better shave. <em>More doesn’t always mean better.</em></p>
<p>So in short, I am done feeling guilty for using a product from a brand that’s hated a lot. It works for me, so I use it.</p>

He gave a new meaning to carrying the team on one’s shoulder. Bowling almost half the team’s share of overs is no small feat. 🏏</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54785515-four-thousand-weeks">Four Thousand Weeks</a>, a philosophical guide by Burkeman about time. This one is the best time management book that preaches one should not fret too much about managing time. Live life being aware of its finitude. Doesn’t matter how much we try, we can never master time. It reminds you throughout the book that you don’t <em>have</em> time, but time is what you <em>are</em>.</p>
<p>Just like Burkeman did with his previous book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13721709-the-antidote">The Antidote</a>, he left with so many profound observations and thoughts. This is not a practical guide of hacks that you could try to follow to improve your life. Rather, it lends an opportunity to reflect on at least a couple of ways you perceive the concept of time, and consequently, lead your life.</p>

			 <p>Every time the grinds of the daily life take toll over me, I travel to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabaleshwar">a place close by</a> with my family and friends. The last weekend was another such occasion.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2021/db1204c1ca.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>I love this place not because it is a perfect family getaway (that it is), but because it is easy to travel to, and so there is not too much planning needed. Most trips get burdensome by the sheer pain of planning so much, so ahead of time. I enjoy the travels where that’s not the case, especially when I have no interest to be a typical tourist and go spot hunting.</p>
<p>The purpose of one’s visit is what matters at the end. If it is to find out everything of interest in a place, sure, go sign up for a hectic few days. Even I do that at times. But, why do that when irrespective of how much you roam around, you can never cover all the interesting places, anyway? The tourists flocking around an attraction kills it for me. It is just a place of business. I prefer the turn en route where no one halts. Or the point which hasn’t got any fancy name yet.</p>
<p>Anyway, I know every nook and corner of this resort I stayed in. My family and I have visited every spot of interest in the place, and so can selectively just visit those that <em>affect us</em>. We did just that this time, too. Maybe, I am different. I am glad that my family is just like me. Crazy different “tourists” that travel <em>for</em> the experience, not <em>with</em> a checklist!</p>
<p>Here are a couple of more pictures from the relaxing trip.</p>

			 <p>While on my morning walk today, I came across a kid who was cycling around our gated community. I see him every day, alone, free — every time I see him, I know he’s enjoying his cycling. Today at a turn, I saw him sitting on the ground, his tumbled cycle next to him. I could see a lady with headphones and a couple busy with their chatters pass by him. The kid was staring down, scratching his knee, focused within.</p>
<p>I felt he wasn’t looking at anything particular, but rather was sad. Maybe he did look at a few people, with expectations, as they passed him by earlier, wishing someone to help him pick his cycle up. Maybe he had his expectations from humanity broken.</p>
<p>Anyway, as I came close to him, I asked him he was fine. All it took was my first word, and he was up on his feet, trying to pick his cycle. Once he gave me his permission to touch his cycle, I helped him get it up on its wheels. He adjusted his tiny spectacles over his nose with his wrist, mumbled a few words and paddled along. I soon saw him chasing pigeons with his cycle, the birds not flying away but hopping around. It looked as if the friends often played this game. In my opinion, his tumble today was a test that we adults failed.</p>
<p>What have we become as a Soceity that we prefer to remain plugged in to our digital worlds, that we don’t even acknowledge a saddened kid who simply needs a nudge to get back to enjoying the realities of life?</p>

			 <p>I feel I have been struggling to find quiet time to read and write recently. I can blame it on many things, but I know within that I am to blame for this feeling. When I get time, I waste it. I convince myself that I need to relax first to get in the groove before I can write or read. I have been relaxing for a few weeks now, and it has only made me more tired.</p>
<p>This leaves me frustrated. Lazy consumption of other’s work is meaningless if it does not trigger any thought. I do that the most these days. I read, but I do not think. I write, but they are shallow thoughts. When do I spend time to churn a few ideas? To word them into something profound? You should write what feels right, I understand. But if it is only the deserts you chomp on, you won’t feel satiated after a point.</p>
<p>I need action, both to my mind and my body. Isn’t it curious that long phases of inactiveness can slowly wear them down? Both readily slide back to their lazy defaults. I need to be strong to push back and to make them move their asses.</p>
<p>Without that, what I have is a dull mind and a couch-clinging body.</p>

There are times when I invariably want the power of Markdown while writing some long posts. It&rsquo;s good that Drummer has that option now. I also like how Dave is implementing it &ndash; it&rsquo;s just a new node type. More I think about that, it feels very similar to WordPress' block-editor, but much better and simple. Even with this though, here&rsquo;s how I summarize my thought.</p>

<p>I do not want to unnecessarily hamper the simplicity of posting with Drummer. That lack of complexity is this system&rsquo;s USP.</p>

			 <p>Festivals are tiring, sipping away mental and physical energy. There's so much to do. <i>And then some more</i>. It feels as if there is no end to all the grind, the "festivities".</p>
<p>But when it all ends, albeit always abruptly, I wait for the next one.</p>
<p>
  Because festivals are necessary. They break the mundane, pause the regularities. I am surrounded by things deemed special, of different nature and scale. 
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  For some, it is the dim lights in the porch. For others, it is the sparkles in the sky.
  <br />
</p>
<p>For some, it is the loud chatters. For others, it is the silent smiles.</p>
<p>For some, it is the crowd. For me, it is <i>the family</i>!</p>
<p>
  Here's to another year of togetherness during the few months of the biggest festivals around the world.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  It was a wonderful festive time for me. And I wish you all a very happy Diwali!

			 <p>Thanks to <a href="https://microthreads.herokuapp.com/discover/user">Micro.Threads</a>, I discovered and followed a couple of folks that I thought I was already following. Fascinating how much the interactions in one&rsquo;s timeline can unearth!</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780446670111">Einstein&rsquo;s Dreams</a> by Alan Lightman today. This is a wonderful collection of thought experiments around our perception of time. The summary of the book says it&rsquo;s a collage of stories &ndash; but there aren&rsquo;t stories. With each &ldquo;story&rdquo;, the author <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8933.Alan_Lightman">Alan Lightman</a> instils a fascinating possibility for the concept of time being something uniquely different. What if everyone settles on their view of time? What if it is always in the past? Or always in the future? Or with just a day of life? It&rsquo;s a thought-provoking list.</p>
<p>All these 30 dreams are poetic vignettes that paint the varied interpretations of time. They evoke emotions through vivid narration of people&rsquo;s lives in such a world and their surroundings. I paused after each chapter, pondering over the impact existence of such realities could have.</p>
<p>At the surface, sure, these are just fictional stories. But dig deep, and you may be able to draw a parallel with realities of our world. With our perception of time. This is a beautifully written, short but profound read! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 📚</p>

			 <p>I call things that I can&rsquo;t put any name to as &ldquo;meta&rdquo;. I already have too many posts that are categorised as #meta. They have nothing to do with Facebook.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meta">how Meta is defined</a> &ndash; all so apt for what Facebook is going for in varying degree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>showing or suggesting an explicit awareness of itself or oneself as a member of its category</i>&rdquo; - Lol! A good joke</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>cleverly self-referential</i>&rdquo; - a lot less clever, a lot more self-referential</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>concerning or providing information about members of its own category</i>&rdquo; - Information-shinformation, bruhh!</p>
<p>So, what is it. Facebook has gone Meta? Meta has engulfed Facebook? Or Facebook <i>is</i> Meta now?</p>
<p>The new name for Facebook is as vague as the future they plan with it.</p>

			 <p>When I published <a href="https://essays.amitgawande.com/goodbyes-are-hard/">the final issue of my newsletter</a> last week, I had promised I won’t send another letter to anyone, even if they stay subscribed. Even if I continue writing the essays. Here’s what I had said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I prefer not to break your trust. You had signed up for something which I no longer intend to deliver.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted the reader to provide me <em>explicit</em> permission to mail the essays. Today, I received the first one, with a really wonderful feedback on my writing. I am so glad the message wasn’t lost.</p>

			 <p>I finished listening to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37786022-storyworthy">Storyworthy by Matthew Dicks</a> and I instantly wanted to purchase the eBook version of the book too. This is one of those few books that are best read as both audio and text version. The audio brings out Matthew’s expertise as a storyteller — you realise how powerful the medium of storytelling is. However, <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com/2021/10/26/104336.html?title=audiobooksAndEbooks">as I had recently complained</a>, it doesn’t give me enough chance to make notes from. Or to go back to those key sections and read them again.</p>
<p>I am not a storyteller by profession. I don’t get on a stage to narrate a story from my life to a group of strangers. Rather, I can’t even do that if I wanted to — the introvert in me shudders even thinking about it. But I do like to tell stories to the people I am comfortable with. To my family, my friends, my colleagues. And what Matthew attempts to narrate in this book is how to do that better.</p>
<p>But it’s not the “how to tell better stories” part that I found helpful. It is how to find those story-worthy moments from your life that had me excited. Matthew has a very natural, effortless way of conveying the methodical ways to identify, prepare and tell your stories easily. You would expect that, he is a teacher first, after all.</p>
<p>At the same time, he is also a writer and a renowned storyteller, though. So, listening to him tell his stories and use them as a tool to teach the process behind was fascinating. He has mastered the art over his many shows, and he lays out everything he has learnt through his experience for his readers to benefit from. He holds back nothing.</p>
<p>I have made so many notes, and I will make a many more when I <em>read</em> this book a second time. One thing, I have got homework for life now. And I don’t complain.</p>
<p>You should read this book even if, like me, you have no intention ever to tell your stories to strangers. Because, as Matthew says, there come moments in our life when we do tell our stories. So, instead of being terrible at it, we can attempt to do slightly better. Maybe we will not bore a few people the next time we ramble along in front of them. A must-read for me. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t remember the last book before <a href="https://sive.rs/h">How to Live</a> by Derek Sivers that made me contemplate so many times while reading. The moment I was done with the last page, I had my diary out to capture my understanding from each of the 27 answers to that one principal question, <em>how should I live</em>.</p>
<p>As Derek says in the subtitle of the book, they are all conflicting answers. But the conclusion is not weird at all — for one, Derek is a masterful and a deep thinker. Each short chapter has most knowledge presented in the least number of words possible. Wisdom to words ratio is pretty high with this gem of a book.</p>
<p>At the surface, the book is pretty straightforward to read. Short chapters. Short, easy sentences. But, dig deep, and it is one of the most difficult books to fathom. It will force you to question what you have believed throughout your life, and it’s that questioning that will leave your mind unclouded.</p>
<p>It’s easy to write long, elaborate prose. But it takes time to shorten it, and I am glad Derek took that time. In his words, it took him four years, often writing 16 hours a day, to condense it down from the first draft of 1300 pages to 115.</p>
<p>What results is one of the most powerful and important books ever written. Take time and read it slowly. ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p>

			 <p>I enjoy writing posts in Drummer. One of the <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com/2021/10/21/163615.html?title=BenefitsofWritingwithDrummer">many reasons</a> for that is I can see all my posts in the same editing space. It is so easy to scroll through all your posts and find reference to just that one old post.</p>
<p>One thing that missing, though, was there was no easy way to get the <code>url</code> for that post right in Drummer. So, I got scripting. I have <a href="https://gist.github.com/am1t/c1a1d37af7cd33aedc9e1263888a70e0">created a script</a> which does just that. Select any node, run the script, and it will present the URL for that post in a dialog box. Here’s how you enable it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy the below Drummer script and paste it in your special <code>opml</code> file for <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml">Scripts menu</a> (File ⇾ Special files ⇾ Scripts menu…)</li>
<li>You will see a new entry in Scripts menu</li>
<li>Select any node, even the headline (a titled post), and select the newly added script menu item</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get the URL for the selected node.</p>

			 <p>I wish there was another view for the timeline at Micro.blog that displays just the long-form posts one after another. The way the timeline is currently, it is always too busy with micro posts, replies and especially images. The updates with just a link in them tend to get lost. Ideally, what I would want is 3 views minimum &ndash; the current one can stay the default. But original posts only and long-form only would be good filters to have.</p>

			 <p>I recently <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/10/12/of-course-i.html">started blogging with Drummer</a>, a new Outliner made public by Dave Winer. It has been a wonderful experience. I don’t know what it is about a single outline as a base for your blog, but it feels natural. I have been enjoying writing and playing around with <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com">my Drummer blog</a>. However, it is not easy to fathom the simplicity of the whole system just through words — only trying it out will make you appreciate the ease. I wanted to capture what it is and how to quickly get started with it for myself and others to follow.</p>
<p>Drummer documentation captures most of this information. But for someone, like me, who’s new to the concept of outliner, the whole stuff can be pretty overwhelming. So, here I capture what I learned and liked so that it helps other newbies like me.</p>
<h2 id="whats-an-outliner">What’s an Outliner?</h2>
<p>An outliner is basically an editor that can edit an outline. What is an outline, you ask? Well, outline is text items represented in a hierarchy, with each item having a parent (typically a title) or multiple sub-items (typically related points). There’s a lot more to know, but I am more focused on drawing a parallel with regular blogging terminologies.</p>
<p>You can think of a first parent item as a title of your post. Each sub-item that follows is like a new paragraph. You can further divide the items into sub-items, that’s grouping related points into a subtitle for example. The only difference is instead of it being represented as a header and list of paragraphs, it is a tree-structure of points, closely related and unrelated.</p>
<p>If a post doesn’t have any child, it’s a titleless post, a micro-post — something like a tweet.</p>
<p>Dave Winer is the strongest proponent of using the outlines as the base for the blogs, he uses them for his blog, <a href="http://scripting.com">Scripting News</a>. The basic hierarchical structure of an outline, makes using outliner for blogging powerful. Both the types of posts, long-form and micro, sit well together. After all, it’s just one long list of text items one after another. Whether they have a sub-item or not define how they get represented. Or that’s how Dave likes them represented.</p>
<p>Drummer is one such outliner that benefits from the years of Dave’s experience. He has understood all the nitty-gritty of blogging through this form. So, once you overcome the initial struggle of unknown, the experience is pretty smooth.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-a-blogging-cms">Is it a Blogging CMS?</h2>
<p>Not really, Drummer is just a web application that can edit outlines. These outlines are typically represented as an <code>OPML</code> file. Basically, all you do with Drummer is edit <code>OPML</code> files of different forms. It wraps a few special <code>OPML</code> files — mainly <code>blog.opml</code> — to give them specific meaning while using them as base for blogging.</p>
<p>But, all we do is edit these <code>OPML</code> files then, what builds the blog?</p>
<p>Well, the software that runs Dave’s blog does that job. It is called <a href="https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog">Old School</a> (because Dave believes this is the old school way of blogging) and is hosted by Dave. In a way, Old School is the blogging CMS and not Drummer.</p>
<p>So, from my understanding, the way the thing connect is as below.</p>
<ol>
<li>You sign in with your Twitter account and that creates the necessary backend — basically a S3 store for your OPML files — based on your Twitter username.</li>
<li>You create, view, edit the <code>OPML</code> files using Drummer. The special files like <code>blog.opml</code> and <code>about.opml</code> hold special meaning for Old School. (<strong>Update:</strong> In fact, <code>about.opml</code> is just used for representation. You can name it anything.) So, you update them and through a command in Drummer (Build my blog), you communicate to Old School server to refresh your blog.</li>
<li>Old School receives the communication and based on provided inputs, it identifies the files to use for building the blog. It reads the <code>OPML</code> files from the backend store for the files and converts them to static files that get served as your blog.</li>
<li>Old School also serves you blog at the <code>http://oldschool.scripting.com/&lt;your-user-name&gt;</code> URL. So in a way, you don’t need to host any additional software.</li>
</ol>
<p class="post-note"> In a way, then, Drummer and Old School together act as your blogging engine. Drummer is your editor where you write your posts. Old School acts as a CMS to build and serve your blog.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-get-started">How do I get started?</h2>
<p>Dave has a got a handy documentation in place that you can follow. I will point to the relevant parts in the documentation so that you can follow along and get started.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Main blog:</strong> Follow the <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628692121000">getting started guide</a> to get a blog up and running with Drummer. In short, create a <code>blog.opml</code> outline file. Make the outline public. And finally, build the blog using <code>Tools &gt; Build my blog...</code>. This should open a new tab with your blog rendered with Old School. You can customise your title and description of your blog and a few head-level attributes.</li>
<li><strong>Title and Description:</strong> Modify/add the head-level attributes <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> and rebuild your blog.</li>
<li><strong>Header Image:</strong> Add a head-level attribute <code>urlHeaderImage</code> pointing to the header image of your choice and rebuild your blog.</li>
<li><strong>Copyright:</strong> Add a head-level attribute <code>copyright</code> with the text you want to appear in the footer and rebuild your blog.</li>
<li><strong>About Page:</strong> If you want to create a new tab in your blog for <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1633177951000">your About page</a>, create a new <code>about.opml</code> outline file using Drummer, make the outline public, add a head-level attribute <code>urlAboutOpml</code> pointing to this public outline and build your blog again. (<strong>Update:</strong> In fact, <code>about.opml</code> is just used for representation. You can name it anything, as long as you configure the value for <code>urlAboutOpml</code> accordingly.)</li>
<li><strong>Link Blog:</strong> If the concept of linkblog excites you, you <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1633177803000">can use another software</a> by Dave, <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a>. Just add a new head-level attribute <code>urlLinkblogJson</code> pointing to your linkblog JSON file, which would look something like <code>http://radio3.io/users/&lt;your-user-name&gt;/linkblog.json</code>.</li>
<li><strong>TimeZone:</strong> To make sure the dates are rendered correctly on your blog, add a head-level attribute <code>timeZoneOffset</code> for the place where you would be blogging from. The value should be the offset from UTC — for example, <code>+5:30</code> for India or <code>-4</code> for New York.</li>
<li><strong>Creating Post:</strong> Head over to your <code>blog.opml</code> file in Drummer and click on the <strong>+</strong> icon (for New Note), write what you want to write and rebuild your blog. Your post should be up.</li>
<li><strong>Adding Links:</strong> Select the text to which you want to add a link, click on the “Link” icon (the second icon from top in the icon bar that sits on the left of the editing area) and insert the URL.</li>
<li><strong>Adding Images:</strong> This one’s slightly tricky. First, have your image hosted on some place where it would be accessible publicly. Get the URL to your image. While on the item you want to associate the image with, click on the “Edit attributes” icon (the third icon from top in the icon bar that sits on the left of the editing area). Now you can either create an inline image (with attribute <code>inlineImage</code>), right-margin image (with attribute <code>image</code>), title image (with attribute <code>metaImage</code>). I wish this work was simpler.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, you should have a well-configured blog up and running. Keep Drummer interface open in tab and keep adding entries. This method of updating your blog will soon grow on you.</p>
<h2 id="what-else-can-i-customise">What else can I customise?</h2>
<p>Even though you have all the basics covered till now, there is still a lot that you can and should do. But I would recommend get comfortable working Drummer and check for yourself if the workflow fits your routine and liking. If it doesn’t, these additional configurations are just a distraction.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you find out that you are enjoying this system of blogging, here are links to a few additional configurations that you can perform.</p>
<ul>
<li>Customise the styling using the custom templates <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628776805000">1</a>, <a href="http://ol.amitgawande.com/2021/10/13/170912.html?title=customTemplateWithDrummer">2</a></li>
<li>Build your blog <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628861390000">with one-click</a> using dedicated icon</li>
<li>Using Custom Domain for your blog. <a href="%20%20https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/#Using%20a%20custom%20domain%20with%20Drummer">PagePark</a>, <a href="https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/#Using%20a%20custom%20domain%20with%20Drummer">NGINX</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1629212543000">Create a Glossary</a> — a text replacement/substitution/expansion list</li>
<li><a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628781021000">Embed Tweet</a>. <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628781065000">Embed YouTube video</a>. <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628781273000">Emoji Short Codes</a>.</li>
<li>Enabling <a href="http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2021/10/15/203642.html?title=https">HTTPS for Drummer Blog</a> (evolving)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-few-additional-notes">A Few Additional Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li>There’s a Mac app (electron based) called <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml">Electric Drummer</a> that can act as an outliner. However, you should avoid using it for blogging if you intend to blog from multiple systems. Changes made through the app can overwrite ones as done on the web Drummer. So thread carefully.</li>
<li>Drummer is evolving. Dave is working hard to make sure all serious reported issues are resolved. Early adopters are trying out a hundred things independently. If that sounds fun, the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues">Drummer support issues page</a> is the place to go.</li>
<li>You can stay-to-date with all things Drummer by following <a href="http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/">this official blog</a>.</li>
<li>How does Drummer cost zero? <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/12.html#a114128">Dave answers</a>.</li>
<li>Why is Drummer, and other software from Dave, so tightly coupled with Twitter? <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/13/140500.html?title=whyWeUseTwitterIdentity">Dave answers</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>—</p>
<p>I intend to use Drummer as a place where I form my thoughts over the time. The ease of the updating process makes posting unformed thoughts a breeze. So, in a way, this space represents the most raw me. You can follow this me as he experiments with <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com">my Drummer blog</a>. And of course, there’s an <a href="http://ol.amitgawande.com/rss.xml">RSS feed</a>.</p>

			 <p><em>Don’t write for others, write for yourself.</em> Most long-time writers give this advice to someone who is just getting started. Actually, screw that. Every person who does any amount (and form) of writing gives this advice to every other person who wishes to do some form of writing.</p>
<p>Easy advice for others, but very difficult to follow oneself. To be frank, what does “not to write for others” even mean? Or write only for yourself?</p>
<p>I write when my mind blanks out. I write when my mind gets crowded. Most of the time, I write as I comment on something I read or listened to. At times, a thought makes me go, &ldquo;Hmm, that&rsquo;s curious. I should write more about it.&rdquo; Occasionally, I write because I want to force myself to write.</p>
<p>Writing something, anything, makes me focused. It calms me down. “I write because I have an innate need to write,” says Orhan Pamuk. More often than not, I share his sentiment.</p>
<p>But I am not perfect. I also write because I want others to read my writing. Trigger a conversation. Read what others think about my thoughts. As an introvert, that’s my only way to open up to others. I don’t care how many people read what I write. As long as I know that some do.</p>
<p>Numbers don’t matter to me. Conversations do.</p>
<p>On a philosophical level, everybody understands this belief of “not writing for others”. Write what your mind wants you to write, don’t write what others want you to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You write because your thoughts are important. You write because you are brave and willing to expose those thoughts. But, most importantly, you write because you have something to say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/live-your-life-on-purpose/why-do-we-write-89e56c069933">A fascinating perspective</a>. It is worded succinctly, but it still is philosophical. Everybody has something to say. But not everybody writes. So, what motivates you to put your thoughts in words?</p>

It’s remarkable how time can’t slacken some threads, lost possibly in the dull grinds of the life. You pick these threads from where you left them. As you remember the memories of yesteryears, you can laugh at them — or be affected by the updates from people that are not around you at this moment.</p>
<p>You know your bond with a few folks is strong when they can lend the present moment innate warmth. You feel a deep kinship, regardless of how much time has passed since you last met them. Yesterday evening was one such occasion, when we tickled many old memories and made a few new ones.</p>

<p>The break also made me realise that I have made a few new friends online, especially from the wonderful community at Micro.blog. I missed the interactions with these folks. Each one of them is a brilliant creator in his or her own way. Bloggers. Photographers. Writers. They all are natural. They all inspire me.</p>
<p>I feel at home here, feel am part of this community. Not a feeling many platforms online can cultivate within you. It’s wonderful to be back and read through the lively discussions. The growth hasn’t dented the warmth, something that is pretty palpable here.</p>

			 <p>Gabriel wonders <a href="https://gabz.org/2021/09/15/on-writing-emails.html">how all write emails</a>, specifically two questions — where to draft and how to review.</p>
<p>I love writing emails, I wish I knew more folks who enjoy my enthusiasm for emails. But my process of doing so is simple. I use the email client to draft the email. If I ever want to get it reviewed from someone else, I will just mail them with the draft or temporarily share the device.</p>
<p>There’s another reason why I don’t use any text editors for emails. Because if I do, I will start writing in Markdown and eventually hate my email client for not growing up.</p>

<p>In 2009, a satellite circled Earth, scanning and sorting the wavelengths reflecting off the planet&rsquo;s surface. Researchers noticed something baffling: an unexpected wavelength of unknown origin. They tried looking at Earth with only this wavelength, and saw the planet covered in a red hue of varying intensity. So, what was going on?</p>

			 <p>Why’s the colour of everything marked unisex so bland? Who decided that mens don’t like any colours other than black or grey or silver? Or who decided that women will only like pink or purple? Why can’t I go on to a street carrying any non-black coloured umbrella and not get stares that judge me?</p>
<p>Some might say it’s trivial, yet I find this behaviour extremely frustrating. We claim we are making progress on multiple levels, yet we continue to stick our age-old presumptions of choices among sexes. And you know what, I have a theory why the choices of colours specifically are advertised in a way they are.</p>
<p>Professional places are bland — colours aren’t professional. Life and playfulness is colourful. So, who do we see as a professional? Well, of course, men. And who’s all about play? Right? <em>Right?</em></p>
<p>Do you want to test this hypothesis? Here are Google Image searches for “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=man+with+umbrella">man with umbrella</a>” — how many blacks do you see there? Now, here’s the results' page for “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=woman+with+umbrella">woman with umbrella</a>”. Same question, how many blacks do you see there? Plus, what other commonality do you see among the images that are on the page? What’s the look that men are flaunting? And what about women? The industry is infuriating. Sigh!</p>

			 <p>Why’s there a fascination among the devs to <em>reinvent</em> the old tech that isn’t broken? Maybe the reason that the tech has stayed the same isn’t because no one attempted to change it. Can you fathom the possibility that the tech might be fine, as it is, to most common folks? Or perhaps it might not be one of those things that most give a hoot about? Yeah?</p>
<p>The two prime examples I see many developers take a go at are browsers and email. Please, both work fine as they are. Don’t try to reinvent them. They have reached a state in which they are open and standard enough already. Most people know the functionality they can expect while using it.</p>
<p>Stop reinventing it. Improve it, no doubt. Make it faster, simpler. Cleaner. But don’t <em>change</em> the definition of what that tech represents. Don’t mar the traits that make the tech great in the first place, universal accessibility.</p>
<p>Don’t attach a lot of muck around the fundamentals of the accepted tech and call it “2.0”. I will suggest call it “1.0” of whatever the heck you want to name it.</p>

			 <p>Kids are free, untouched by the necessities of the life. The concept of “necessary” doesn’t register itself with them.</p>
<p>For a kid, everything is necessary and, at the same time, nothing is. Is it necessary to eat? Sure, if he is hungry. Otherwise, it isn’t.</p>
<p>A kid does nothing because <em>it</em> is necessary to do it. He does it because <em>he</em> wants to do it.</p>
<p>In that sense, a kid always emphasises inwards, focuses on what is important to himself. As we grow, we forgot what matters. We emphasise what’s external.</p>
<p>The societal pressures. The fear of missing out. A kid knows none. <em>I like this</em> is all he cares about.</p>
<p>Listen to the kid in you, he sits closest to your heart. And if you can’t hear him, life’s going to a difficult journey, my friend. Be quick and wake up that kid within you.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780393609394">Astrophysics for People in a Hurry</a> by Neil deGrasse Tyson. In a way, it&rsquo;s a must read for a lot many people 📚</p>
<p>I am certain it isn&rsquo;t for dummies neither does it claims to be so anywhere. It is for folks in a hurry, sure. I can&rsquo;t remember the last non-fiction book that read so easy for me. This feat is even more praiseworthy, given Neil deGrasse Tyson attempts to touch upon some of the most complicated and <i>buzz-wordy</i> topics from the past 13 billion of existence of this universe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them. In other words, after the laws of physics, everything else is opinion,&rdquo; says Tyson. I have rarely heard someone be so calm, yet extremely badass at the same time.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Seth Godin <a href="https://seths.blog/2021/08/the-inevitable-decline-of-fully-open-platforms/">talking about</a> how open platforms are always in risk of becoming spammy and losing the trust of the users. I entirely agree — it’s a path that most platforms, open and closed, follow.</p>
<p>They enjoy the carefree attention from the excited early adopters who associate with the core values of the platform creators. But as the platform grows, it attracts users which would neither share the excitement nor the patience of the early adopters. They get noisy — they want to use the platform like their old one they are comfortable with. They <em>need</em> features that they are used to, not what the platform provides.</p>
<p>So, eventually, the tension that Seth refers to above gains prominence.</p>

			 <p>It’s crazy how one’s mind works. Here are two posts separated by 4 years. I recently <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/08/16/i-am-a.html">published one a couple of weeks back</a>. I had <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2017/09/01/160500.html">published another in 2017</a>. Both the posts talk about a similar observation, about the constant fight between the coder and a writer in me. It reads in such a similar manner. The choice of words, the structure, the flow. It should be pretty apparent to anyone who reads it that both the posts come from the mind. From the same author.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, when I wrote the recent post, I had no clue that I had written about the same topic earlier some time. In a way, then, the adage that “there’s no original work being written, but just rewrites” is not that far off.</p>

			 <p>Now that <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/08/31/googles-inability-to.html">I think about it</a>, the overall messaging space is a mess and personally it’s a frustrating issue for me. We are so close, yet so far. Here’s what I want.</p>
<ol>
<li>A service for messaging folks, share text and images</li>
<li>A service for voice/video calls</li>
<li>A service that does both 1 and 2 with apps across platforms - mainly iOS, Android and Web</li>
</ol>
<p>This will allow me to not worry about device on which I am using it.</p>
<p>iMessage and FaceTime combination is brilliant, but Apple continues to see them as differentiators for its ecosystem. I don’t blame them — but it hurts me. I interact with only a handful of people that own an Apple device.</p>
<p>Google, well, decides to live in a fantasy world where there can exist no perfect messaging app. They get close to finding that right solution and throw it all away.</p>
<p>I had hopes from Microsoft. But for some reason they seem not to be interested in consumer space. Skype is ugly, its too bloated and the experience is terrible. It is not easy for families to join from.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, amidst all the mess, remains the only solution that does the required to any extend. It’s a terrible experience, but at least it works.</p>

			 <p>I came across <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/donelist">this suggestion from Oliver Burkeman</a> a few time in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if you worked on the basis that you began each day at zero balance, so that everything you accomplished – every task you got done, every tiny thing you did to address the world&rsquo;s troubles, or the needs of your household – put you ever further into the black?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, the idea is to keep a done list rather than a to-do list. I am absolutely certain that it benefits one&rsquo;s morale. I know that because I have been maintaining a form of done list &ndash; just that my method is different. For me, the two lists are complementary. I use a to-do list as a way to free my mind of the burden to remember things I need to do.</p>
<p>I do not set a target, an end date, for any of the tasks on the to-do list. So, they are not burdensome to me as my day begins. I look at the list, prioritize and just plan it through the day, if possible. A bullet journal helps me here - and also acts as a done-list. More the crosses on a page, more is the satisfaction.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading  <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781400064281">Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die</a> by Chip Heath. I wanted to love this book - the premise is brilliant. But it reads like a textbook, and that&rsquo;s no way to make a message stick with your readers. For that matter, that doesn&rsquo;t even look to be the author&rsquo;s intention.</p>
<p>To start with, the book lacks a clear, central idea that every chapter circles back to - it&rsquo;s all over the place. It digs into the history to find and describe every event, research or anecdote where a difficult message was conveyed effectively. Once it does that, the author summaries his understanding of why that worked.</p>
<p>First, the author nonchalantly tells you what the learning is &ndash; &ldquo;Which message do you think works best? Of course, second&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m sorry, but let the reader come to that conclusion. Don&rsquo;t beat him on the head till he gives up and agrees in frustration.</p>
<p>Second, each time the reasons that the message was effectively conveyed in each story are too varied &ndash; it references almost every phycological/managerial techniques - Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy and five whys and on &amp; on.</p>
<p>Finally, suggestions like be simple/concrete, don&rsquo;t bury the lead, capture attention etc are easier said that done. They are a set of skill that all understand they should have, but not every person has in equal doses. Please, your suggestion cannot be &ldquo;become a master public speaker or leader or designer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sigh, it was frustrating to read through this book. Ironically, it fails to follow the message it wishes to convey - talk about one message, be simple and concise. It would have stuck with me then. 📚</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I started writing actively on the web some 15 years back. As I look back today to these years gone by, I realize I have discovered a few ironies of life, a few lessons for the writer within me. Today, I want to evaluate where I am and share what I have learned over these years. But let me start with a fascinating Aesop’s fable, though — a tale about a man, his son and their hard-working donkey.</p><p>A man and his son were once walking to the market with their donkey along by their side. Neither of them was sitting on the donkey. A fellow countryman suggested, “Why don't you ride on the donkey? After all, what is it for but to ride upon, you fool?”</p><p>When the man put only the boy on the donkey, another person complained, “Look at that lazy youngster who lets his father walk. Yet, he rides.” Tired, when he got on himself, a woman scoffed, “Shame on that lazy person. He lets his poor little son plod along. Yet, he rides.”</p><p>Well, the man took his boy up before him on the donkey, and the passers-by started jeering and pointing at them. “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey of yours,” they said.</p><p>The man and boy, at last, lifted the donkey over their heads and carried him on their shoulders. They went along as all who they met laughed at them. The donkey, though, knew just one way to live — to do his thing. So, he was still flapping his legs in the air.</p><p>In short, everyone had laughed at the man and the son, whatever they did. It's an interesting tale of how criticism, if paid any heed to, would just make things worse for you. However, here's how I look at the story. </p><p>Do you know who was unaffected as the town was laughing along? Yep, the donkey. Do you know who didn't get any criticism from anyone? Yep, the donkey.</p><p>As I began writing more on the web and making it public, I realized very early on that I cannot let the criticism or the scoff that I will invariably receive from the ugly Internet affect me. I wrote on my blog. I wrote on Medium. Not only that, I shared my writings at many places, not being worried about what others will say. That was so unlike me, the introvert. But if I hadn't done so, I may have stopped writing a long time back.</p><p><em>Try to please everyone, and you will please no one,</em> the saying goes. So, be a donkey, stay unaffected by the criticism and continue your creative work.</p><hr><p>Through these 15 years, my productivity for writing has not been consistent, though. I have been super productive at times, publishing multiple posts in a week, and then there have been times when I did not post for months. I have blamed it on platforms, the editors, my lifestyle, my likings etc. But I have come to realize it is cyclic for me, these are all phases. I do want to compare two specific phases that I have enjoyed a lot. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586875103900-8291ee09d6fd?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHBoYXNlcyUyMG9mJTIwbGlmZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjkyOTMyMDc&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="5184" height="3888" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586875103900-8291ee09d6fd?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHBoYXNlcyUyMG9mJTIwbGlmZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjkyOTMyMDc&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586875103900-8291ee09d6fd?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHBoYXNlcyUyMG9mJTIwbGlmZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjkyOTMyMDc&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586875103900-8291ee09d6fd?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHBoYXNlcyUyMG9mJTIwbGlmZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjkyOTMyMDc&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586875103900-8291ee09d6fd?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHBoYXNlcyUyMG9mJTIwbGlmZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjkyOTMyMDc&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@molnj?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Jocelyn Morales</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>There was a time when was I was <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/categories/fiction/">writing fiction</a> pretty regularly. I made it a habit, a routine to write short stories and send them to publications on Medium. I was productive, and I had fun. But for some unknown reason, I had stopped reading. I now feel I had even stopped living, unaware of events that I was surrounded by.</p><p>That did not help. And I was reminded of another phase when I wasn't churning fiction from my mind. I just narrated things happening around me, and yet I was most creative and productive then.</p><p>I wrote posts about <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2010/02/04/230700.html">crappy elevator logic</a>, <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2010/05/15/191300.html">stupid bets</a>, <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2014/08/13/105900.html">my conscious subconscious</a> or the time when I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2009/09/27/202300.html">didn't claim my spectacles</a> because I preferred not to hurt my ego. Were these posts great? Who cares? I felt good. I could never weave a better story than what life was weaving around me.</p><p>Keep your eyes open. Some of the most amazing stories surround us. Stay inspired — because <em>life creates better stories than a writer's pen</em>. You just have to pay attention.</p><p>And don't ever halt for planning what you want to write. During each of these phases of my writing, I thought I knew where I wanted to take my writing to. A life journal. Fiction. Humour.</p><p>It was as if I was deciding for myself what I was <em>allowed to</em> write, what I would enjoy writing for the longest, or what I would be good at. That was senseless — I now know that would have never worked. But as Chris Crutchly said, <em>hindsight's never around when you need it</em>.</p><p>There is no point planning too much, too ahead. Just create. Do what your heart says now, without thinking where it will lead you. Don't try to connect the dots while you are planting them — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc">a genius once said</a> you can only do that looking backwards.</p><hr><p>Nonetheless, there are times when I do halt. After all, life does suck every so often. It has been doing that for the past 18 months. I was taken over by boredom, and yet didn't know what I could do with all the time I had at my hands. I was living through phases that weren't comfortable. And I followed the easiest path, I stopped writing. I have done such foolhardy multiple times in these last 15 years.</p><blockquote>Under heaven, all can see beauty as beauty, ⁣<br>only because there is ugliness.</blockquote><p>Lao Tzu, the famous Chinese philosopher, says while talking about the duality of life. It is so true. It's easy to forget that things will eventually improve. We begin to label things. Negative and positive. Right and wrong. Sad and happy. But, as the masters at Pixar once said, “<em>Sometimes the only way to really appreciate joy is to experience sadness</em>”. </p><p>Lao ends his verse with these lines.</p><blockquote>"When the work is done, it is forgotten.<br>That is why it lasts forever."</blockquote><p>Yep, don't halt. Create. Write. Get bored. Be surrounded by negative thoughts. Get bogged down by them. But don't stop writing.  Don't publish them, sure. Let them lie forgotten in the pages of your diary. But write.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490730141103-6cac27aaab94?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGluc3BpcmF0aW9ufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyOTI5MzQxMQ&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="Without wings I can feel free" loading="lazy" width="5184" height="3456" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490730141103-6cac27aaab94?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGluc3BpcmF0aW9ufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyOTI5MzQxMQ&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490730141103-6cac27aaab94?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGluc3BpcmF0aW9ufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyOTI5MzQxMQ&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490730141103-6cac27aaab94?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGluc3BpcmF0aW9ufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyOTI5MzQxMQ&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490730141103-6cac27aaab94?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGluc3BpcmF0aW9ufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyOTI5MzQxMQ&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@coopery?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Mohamed Nohassi</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>And definitely don't wait for the inspiration to come to you from outside. I have realized it's the worst way to get inspired to write. I read. I listen. I see. And that's when I write. I can't depend on others for inspiration. I need to seek it out. </p><p>Things tend to happen to you in life when you are not ready. So, I am always ready. I am always writing. What's written is not perfect every time. But when that one perfect thought does hit me, I am usually ready. And boy, I have written my fair share of imperfect posts. Stupid posts. When I read a few of these posts from the early days, I cringe. </p><p>I was told the tone of my posts is not right. Or the platform I am writing at is not right. Or my method of sharing is not right. But I didn't care. I was stubborn in what I wanted to write. It was OK if it came out stupid.</p><p>But you know what, at times I wish I could still be that same free self. The stupid one. I had the most fun then. I am a shadow of that person — but I have learned the lesson. It's OK to be stupid. Just be alive. I write what my mind wants me to write <em>now</em>. At this moment. I write what I want to read. It doesn't matter how cringe-worthy it sounds.</p><p>Be stupid. But then be playful. Be eager to learn.<br>Be stubborn. But then be cautious. Be friendly.</p><p>Do you know what other animal shares all these characteristics as per Wikipedia? A donkey. So be a donkey. But act. Write. Create.</p><hr><p>I had delivered a talk with this content as part of <a href="https://micro.camp/">Micro Camp 2021</a>.</p><p>Cover Artwork by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@cristina_gottardi?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Cristina Gottardi</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/creative?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

			 <p>I am a coder and a writer. And it is absolutely painful to have these two personalities live within you.</p>
<p>When the coder wants to code, the writer is checking his choice of words or the structure of comments. Or the depth of documentation -- the writer wants the coder to write an essay. The coder wants to bloody put bullet points, command followed by command. What ends up happening is I take minutes to name one method because the writer didn't like my choice of verb. Urghh!</p>
<p>On the other hand, the coder makes the life miserable for the writer in me. All the writer wants to do is focus on penning words together. Get coherent, and impactful. And all the writer is whispering in his ears is, "Look at that font and the colour scheme of the editor. That doesn't look nice, right? What if there is a better editor? What if <i>you</i> make one?"</p>
<p>All the writer wants to do is read intently, and there is the coder shouting at him, "Why isn't your website this beautiful? Look how efficiently it uses JavaScript? Or doesn't use it at all." Anything and everything can get the coder excited.</p>
<p>
  Boy, given the pain this causes, I'm surprised am still a coder by profession and a writer by hobby. I, at times, feel they could very well kill each other one day.

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/08/04/rating-the-film.html">Rating the film rating systems</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Isn't it odd that we can't decide on a consistent content rating system across all the countries? I know I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2020/11/12/i-dont-understand.html">have ranted about this</a> a many times before this. But I just can't wrap my head around the fact that we, supposedly smart humans, haven't figured out a way yet to addresses such a trivial aspect of our film watching experience.</p>
<p>
  How difficult is it to say that this content is made for children 6 years and above? Or 13 years and above?
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  I know. I'm ignoring the fact that all nations are not governed the same. They have individual definitions and expectations of freedom. Oversimplifying the problem at hand may not take us anywhere. The least I can do at least is to check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_picture_content_rating_system">which countries handle this rating problem the best</a>. 
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  I find it fascinating that Turkey has the simplest content rating system. These are the rating — <i>General Audience, 6+, 10+, 13+, 16+, 18+</i>. Austria is in the same league — <i>Unrestricted, 6, 10, 12, 14, 16</i>. Russia's not too far behind, too — <i>0+, 6+, 12+, 16+, 18+</i>. 
  <br />
</p>
<p>India has a simple range — <i>U, UA, A, S</i>. But those characters are meaningless. How is one to map them to the age of the child?</p>
<p>United States follows an even more muddled system — <i>G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17</i>. That's complication is unnecessary. It's unfortunate that those are the ratings that are most widely followed.</p>
<p>
  A couple of curious cases. South Africa has these categories — <i>A, PG, 7–9PG, 10–12PG, 13, 16, 18, X18, XX</i>. Plus these sub-descriptors — <i>S, L, V, P, N, H, D, SV</i>. Wow! I am sure a significant post-production budget goes towards arriving at the right rating for a film.
  <br />
</p>
<p>And finally, of course, China. It has no official rating system. There are only two categories — suitable for all ages and banned.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>
  Here are a few additional observations and a proposal. 6, 16 and 18 are the most commonly agreed boundaries for the films. Only a few countries have any ranges beyond 18.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  So, if we manage to find an agreeable boundary between 6 ad 16, we should be able to cover major countries with these ratings — 
  <i><b>0+, 6+, 12+, 16+, 18+</b></i>
  . I am sure folks smarter than me will find a better way of conveying all why this system should work. Or convince me why this will never work.
  <br />

<p>These methods of archiving are either imperfect, impractical, or both—and besides, even if I went through with them, chances are that decades from now, I’d just end up with a monster text file or a long-obsolete hard drive that would be a pain to sync up with some future listening platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I lost my music collection some 7 years back and I never attempted to build a personal music library since then. I have accepted the fact that the benefits of streaming services (mainly around discovery) are more valuable to me than my quest for a personal collection of my favorite songs. Unfortunate, but practical.</p>

			 <p>I am wary of using any Apple services as my default - they make it very difficult to use them outside of their ecosystem. I do not use only Apple devices. There was a time when I did. And then things slowly changed.</p>
<p>I use Windows at work. I use Android and iOS. I use iPad. Apple services rarely work well across all the platforms. <em>Just access then on web</em> is not an answer am comfortable with.</p>
<p>So as much as I dislike it, I am slowly using more and more services from Google and Microsoft. Surprisingly, Microsoft does well to fill the void between Android and iOS platforms with apps that work well on both platforms backed by Microsoft services.</p>
<p>I find it crazy that neither Google nor Apple are keen to address this key problem.</p>

  In the last three days, I have started reading three new books. It wasn't planned, people who know my likings recommended the books to me. And each read brilliantly in samples. So, I am reading five in parallel now - a humour, a mystery, a self-help, one on psychology and one fantasy. Now, that's a personal record. No harm doing that, right? <i>Right?</i>

			 <p>I am reading many people's writing process today and am absolutely stunned at how simple my writing needs are. I don't write drafts after drafts in any tool. All my drafts are one line ideas in my notebook or saved articles with tags "to-write". I find time for writing and complete a post about an idea or article.</p>
<p>
  For that matter, most of my posts are spontaneous -- I get a thought and I put it down into a post. I don't insert too many images, individual or as part of the posts. Sure, there are times when I need to spend time on researching or explaining some projects that I am working on. Or when I am writing a fiction. Such posts are very rare, though (and continue to become even rarer as the time goes on).
  <br />
</p>
<p>Plus, I like writing in Markdown. But I am not too attached to the language. I could very well go about writing posts after posts without using any of the Markdown syntax. The most I do is emphasize a word or a line. It won't matter to me how I do it. That said, I continue to enjoy writing my post in Markdown editors and would do that wherever I get a chance.</p>
<p>There was a time when all my posts originated in some text editor installed on my laptop. But that's not the case any more. Most of the posts that I write are in a portal of sorts hosted on web - mainly <a href="quill.p3k.io/">Quill</a>. (I wish Micro.blog had a better writing interface, though. The current one is too basic and doesn't work well for longer posts). On a mobile device, I only write microposts and I would post them from some Micropub client -- I use Micro.blog apps (Gluon or Dialog) or Indigenous.</p>
<p>
  All in all, I have realized I have a simple publishing workflow. I open a web or mobile app, put down my thoughts and hit publish. So, what use do I have for the text editors any more?

  I dislike the fact that I have published very few long form posts recently. It's as if I can only think in micro form. Should it matter? I don't think so. But I have slowly come to the realization that I am writing with one eye on the character count. It's really foolish of me to do that. But I do this subconsciously. 
  <br />
</p>
<p>Somewhere deep down, a thread also continuously evaluates how the post is going to look in a timeline -- the only one where I believe it matters would be Micro.blog. Again, it's foolish. But I have realized it affects me. If it didn't, I would be publishing more posts with titles.</p>
<p>
  I need to bring my mind out of the habit to character check my posts.

			 <p>OnePlus completely messed up my upgrade plans with its product launches this year.</p>
<p>I have been pleased with my OnePlus 7, it has worked brilliantly for the past two years. For that matter, the phone continues to work well for me. It hasn&rsquo;t slowed down. Battery still lasts me throughout the day. I just wish for better cameras now.</p>
<p>I had made my mind that my next phone was going to be the pro variant of next OnePlus. But somehow the company has managed to screw up its most valuable brand.</p>
<p>First, they priced the devices far too high this year. In itself, it&rsquo;s OK if you can match the offerings of the other flagship brands - mainly Apple and Samsung - beyond the device. OnePlus still has some work to do to reach that state.</p>
<p>Then, after unnecessary hype, they launched a product which has been <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/search/query?q=oneplus&amp;wm=false">marred by coverage</a> that they could very well have avoided. They mindlessly under-spec&rsquo;d the non-pro variant of the device. The pro variant is facing the outcome of overpromising and then deliver just on expected lines.</p>
<p>I could still decide to ignore the negative coverage and go ahead with the Pro variant. The reviews haven&rsquo;t been too bad, and I know what I can expect from a OnePlus device now. But I wish the company did not make the decision so difficult for me. I had just started warming up to the Android platform and its benefits.</p>

<p>All I do is focus my mind to nothingness - a soft focus, no thoughts, no plans. The regularities the life serves can wait.  Not for long, of course. But I breathe my calmest breaths in these short moments.</p>

			 <p>It was exactly a year ago that I had <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2020/04/26/214000.html">posted</a> my thoughts on <a href="https://qz.com/work/1836105/20-great-questions-to-ask-instead-of-how-are-you-doing-right-now/">a few key questions</a>. The idea was to capture how I was doing right then. It was a welcome and much needed introspection. I didn't want to miss on the opportunity to revisit the answers from the last year and see what has changed.</p>
<p>
  It was a nice exercise. My thoughts a year back were so quite unfamiliar to what I am going through today. So, here's an update to the same set of questions. Again, I would love to hear how <i>you </i>are doing.
  <br />
</p>
<p> <strong>How are you taking care of yourself today?</strong> </p>
<p>
  Regular exercise and daily meditation. Reading a lot more fiction and non-fiction. I'm still listening to music and many audiobooks. Staying far away from news.
  <br />
</p>
<strong>What part of your shelter-in-place residence have you come to appreciate the most?</strong> 
<p>
  Garden at my home. The wooden swing at the top floor that overlooks the garden. 
  <br />
</p>
<strong>What surprising thing have you been stocking up on (that isn’t toilet paper)?</strong> 
<p>
  Biscuits. Lots of them.
  <br />
</p>
<strong>What’s a story — from a book, a movie, an article, a conversation — that you’ve been gripped by recently? Why did it capture you?</strong> 
<p>
  Nothing grips me any more. Maybe I have grown numb?
  <br />
</p>
<strong>What habit have you started, or broken, during the quarantine?</strong> 
<p>
  I have stopped staying awake late into the Friday and Saturday nights. That was one habit I had, stay up late either mindlessly watching something or working on side projects.
  <br />
</p>
<p>As an effect, I am following a pretty routine. Get a calming and wholesome sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Which specific place in your neighborhood are you most looking forward to visiting once this is all over?</strong> </p>
<p>
  Again, every part of the neighbourhood. Especially malls and the restaurants.
  <br />
</p>
<strong>What’s the easiest part about the quarantine?</strong> 
<p>
  Getting bored. And getting creative.
  <br />
</p>
<strong>What are some things you have realized that you don’t really need?</strong> 
<p>
  Cash. And fancy clothes. What I wear at home is often good enough even outside.
  <br />
</p>
<strong>What’s something you own that feels useful?</strong> 
<p>
  Kindle. Headphones.
  <br />
</p>
<strong>What is your COVID-19 nickname/alter-ego?</strong> 
<p>
  Calm workaholic.
  <br />
</p>
<strong>What problem—either yours, or something more global —do you wish you could solve?</strong> 
<p>
  Global Stupidity. Political Divisiveness. Natural Selfishness.
  <br />
</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time">Make Time: How to Focus on What Matters Every Day</a> today. I cannot apply all the suggestions that the authors have to offer. But it&rsquo;s a fascinating list of a few easy to follow tactics, presented in a no-nonsense manner. The authors stay to the point; they don&rsquo;t ramble along as many authors of the self-help books tend to do.</p>
<p>I did find a few of the suggestions pretty useful and have already incorporated a couple. I can clearly see the benefit. What helped is that the authors worked in an industry and in roles that I can closely associate with. So, I could relate to many of the problems they talked about and was keen to hear what changes worked for them.</p>
<p>If you are at a full-time job and are struggling to get the right balance between work and life, this book would have a few strategies that you might find useful. 📚</p>

  Music is the only time machine out there. You come across a song or an album, and a flood of memories and emotions come rushing at you. You almost relive those priceless moments. Exaggeration? I think not.
  <br />
</p>
<p>You get transported back to the time when you listened to that song the first time. Or when you spent hours and days crooning along, the album on repeat mode. You vividly feel your surrounding from that time. The place you were at. The mental state you were in. <i>The happiness of loneliness</i>. Or the craziness with those few, old friends. You remember the moments that matter, the moments that are tucked deep within your heart.</p>
<p>I am not saying anything groundbreaking here. Each one of us has experienced this ability of music. Many have worded it a lot more beautifully even.</p>
<p>
  I consider this a superpower and am reminded of this every few months. Most often, the time I hop back to is the early 2000s, the time that I cherish the most. It was a new phase of my student life. A period with a lot more independence. A period when my thoughts were moulded. Today was one such day. 
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  A lesser-known <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2gh7v41s3eKkw5fTdfMEYR?si=m0cw1icYQM-Cvy67sPigOw">A.R. Rahman album</a>. It's not even among one of his best. But it's close to me, though. I can't explain why; maybe the feeling of the songs resonated with what I was going through in my life. I didn't understand a word of those lyrics; it was the first non-Hindi, non-English album I listened to. But as they say, music has no language. And good music doesn't need words to convey an emotion.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Sure, the album doesn't evoke the same feelings in me today. But I momentarily relive that unfamiliar phase of freedom every time. Just as I did today. </p>

			 <p>My family loves to watch singing reality shows. It's an opportunity for me to get some focused time when I read or write. I do join in occasionally, though. This weekend was one such occasion.</p>
<p>For one, A. R. Rahman was going to be on the show as a guest. I love this man and his music. I won't miss a chance to watch the people contending to be good at singing attempt the maestro's brilliant tunes. The episode did not disappoint -- a contestant attempted one of the trickiest songs ever composed by Rahman, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clVEQrCXocg">Satrangi Re</a>. </p>
<p>As the performance came to an end (and the director decided to stuff it with unnecessary stuff), a little dialogue happened at our home. The contestant mentioned the first album he purchased was Rahman's, and he wanted Rahman's autograph on the old audio cassette. My daughter looked on with her curiosity piqued by watching the object the guy was holding. She genuinely asked, "what's a cassette, dad?"</p>
<p>Boy, I had a nostalgic few minutes. I explained all about how I used to listen to songs when I was a child. I showed her the images of the audio cassettes, up close and afar. But you know what she was most interested in? Sony Walkman.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2021/de50c5fa3a.jpg" width="400" height="635" alt="" />
<p>I dearly wish I had not given away my Sony Walkman to one of my cousins. Sure, I had made her day by passing on the tech I did not need. But I loved my Walkman. And pleasing to see my daughter get fascinated by the beauty. And she has owned every type of iPod -- yet the retro-tech will always hold its charm.</p>
<p>By the way, the contestant I mentioned above, Ashish Kulkarni, is too good a singer. Just watch him nail a track I love, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-8B1PAxvSo">Alvida from Life in a Metro</a>.</p>

			 <p>I have been reading many books from Christie recently. Every time I get into a reading lull, I pick up a Poirot mystery and start reading. I was facing one such lull and Dame Agatha was to the rescue again. Her books always help me get back to reading more.</p>
<p>Anyway, after I read another of her wonderfully crafted mysteries &ndash; <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215492.Lord_Edgware_Dies">Lord Edgware Dies</a> &ndash; I wondered why are these books not generally adapted to TV series and films. Most of her books are perfect. Yet, we hardly see any adaptations. Is it due to licensing?</p>
<p>Anyway, the one attempt I had seen recently was the disappointing <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/murder_on_the_orient_express_2017">Murder on the Orient Express</a> from 2017. It was unnecessarily stylized, the adaptations need to let the story take over. The complex simplicity is the most important virtue of the Christie&rsquo;s stories. Then there is the old, yet long-running, TV series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094525/">Poirot</a> &ndash; again, enjoyable in parts but tries too hard. That said, I have liked whatever I have managed to see (mostly on YouTube).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much scope for something in the middle, not too stylized and yet, a modern adaptation. Preferably in the form of a film or a TV mini-series. I did come across one such adaptation, the 2015 three episode television <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Then_There_Were_None_(TV_series)">mini-series of And Then There Were None</a>. IMDB Plus has made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nh56fQe-zk">all the episodes available on YouTube</a>. I enjoyed this particular form. I felt it worked.</p>
<p>So sad that there isn&rsquo;t much readily available.</p>

When I first realized that this was happening, I would reread the paragraph or two that I’d missed, but my subconscious—or, more specifically, my third eye—told me that it wasn’t necessary, so I just kept reading and thinking and have now read more books than ever before.</p>

  I updated my <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/now/">/now</a> page today after a long time. I usually maintain a thought's archive as part of the page for the updates that are no longer relevant. The idea behind is revisiting
the thoughts that once were at the top of my mind is another way for me to retrospect.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  Today I've reset that section for 2021. And below is an unadulterated list of the thought archive from 2020 -- so in a way a snapshot (<i>incomplete, sure</i>) of the year that went by.
  <br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>I’m trying to get into a habit of regular meditation. I want to give it a chance again.</li>
  <li>I'm in love with the Hamilton soundtrack. I keep going back to it every now and then.</li>
  <li>Study Café Album on Spotify has been my go-to album every time I want to focus. If that fails, the real café ambient noise from Coffitivity does the job.</li>
  <li>I have started writing frequently now. The simpler writing workflow with WordPress is helping.</li>
  <li>Need to get the backup solution for posts (probably in WordPress) addressed.</li>
  <li>Focus on deciding on the format, the frequency and the tone of the newsletter.</li>
  <li>Where would my blog go next? Or will it stay here? It would most probably not be WordPress</li>
  <li>I want a better writing interface. Or maybe not? Why do I want to create something perfect myself?</li>
  <li>Need to get to <a href="https://github.com/davidmerfield/Wall/issues/7">the improvements planned for Wall</a>.</li>
  <li>Read. Read. Read. Write. Write. Write.</li>
  <li>I need to finish the couple of books I had <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/21425016-amit?shelf=currently-reading">started reading</a> in the last month</li>
  <li>Implement a micropub client. Get anything working. Without UI. Dropped the idea</li>
  <li>Getting used to <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/the-new-normal-covid">the new normal</a>.</li>
  <li>Write about and share details about <a href="https://wall.blot.im/">Wall</a>. Feedback and issues.</li>
  <li>Get IndieLogin working -- just been too long now</li>
  <li>Get distracted with the side projects, again. IndieWeb's done.</li>
  <li>Start reading and writing again</li>
  <li>Stop procrastinating items from *must-do* list</li>
  <li>Fix issue with webmentions from Brid.gy</li>
  <li>Send webmentions to target on replies/likes</li>
  <li>Support for updates in blotpub</li>
  <li>Decision on upcoming nearby travel</li>
  <li>Handle crossposting to Twitter and Mastodon for longer posts</li>
  <li>Style webmentions section to my liking. It is too bloated in the current form</li>
  <li>Start `\now` page to be updated regularly</li>
  <li>Consolidate all my online content onto a single place (*most probably blot*)</li>
  <li>Move old content from Hugo to archive (a Hugo site)</li>
  <li>Change stuff around</li>

  Dan Lewis recently made me aware of one of the most beautiful love story, that of <a href="http://nowiknow.com/long-distance-love-birds/">Long Distance Love Birds</a>. 
  <br />
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The story would have ended there but in 2001, something unexpected happened: another stork arrived. A male stork. The two mated and shortly afterward, the male stork left, as one would expect, being a migratory bird and all. But storks are also known for being serial monogamists; while they don’t mate for life, they tend to stick with the same partner so long as that partner is on the same migratory path. In this case, though, Malena had no migratory path, and the bird that happened across her nest seemed unlikely to return.</p>
  <p>Until he did, a year later. And a year after that. And a year after that, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Ah, love indeed is universal. And in this case, it literally has no boundaries. Such a pretty, happy story. To anyone who says long-distance relationship doesn't work, I have <i>another</i> real life story bookmarked now.

			 <p>It was a couple of years ago when I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2019/03/25/213000.html">had ranted</a> about how the alternatives to the popular social networks are not seriously considered. A discussion something on these lines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What all alternatives have you tried? Were there none that were good? If so, why? What is missing? How can they be made better? What is it that you are looking for in a social network?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s so frustrating to see the state hardly change. A call to <em>tell the makers of the service why you cannot use their service</em> is rarely answered. Sure, new social networks are launched, but they have the same underlying problems. They create unnecessary flutter and eventually die down. Why not create buzz for something that&rsquo;s not aiming simply for the acquisition?</p>

Sure, it gets safer as more people in the community get vaccinated. But starting to roam around getting rid of the masks and shaking hands is not the way. Am I being too cynical?

			 <p>My daughter has been reading short storybooks since she was 5. She likes to read &ndash; she would find a comfortable corner for herself and start reading her books. I was a bit cautious introducing her to a full-length novel, though. I didn&rsquo;t want to dampen her interest in reading by the usual wordiness of the novels.</p>
<p>But recently, she asked me for some big books &ndash; &ldquo;I am bored with these small stories,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<em>I know them by heart now.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, I did give her a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27558257-magic-of-the-lost-temple">couple of</a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6310.Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory">&ldquo;big&rdquo; books</a> last week, and she hardly goes anywhere without her book since then. She carries a pencil and an eraser, underlines words she doesn&rsquo;t understand well, bookmarks pages. Ah, I&rsquo;m so happy to see her so engrossed while reading. I wish I had started reading sooner; I&rsquo;m delighted to see my daughter has.</p>
<center><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2021/87b77d4b64.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="" /> </center>
<p>Oh, recently I have seen another habit of hers. She likes to copy small stories into her notebook, then read them in her handwriting and out loud in her voice. Yay!</p>
<p>I wish she keeps her interest in reading intact as she grows and would assist her in whichever way possible. To start with though, I need to choose the right books.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16366.Endless_Night">Endless Night by Agatha Christie</a> and am not at all impressed. This review might contain spoilers, but I can&rsquo;t help I have to rant.</p>
<p>Nah, I am not letting the ending influence the overall rating for the book again. It is easy to get wowed by the intelligent ending and rate this book highly. But it wasn&rsquo;t a good read for me.</p>
<p>Right from the start, I didn&rsquo;t trust the narrator. I guess I&rsquo;ve been fooled by many first-person narrations for my liking. Michael is a poor narrator - not sure if it was intentional on Christie&rsquo;s part. None of his actions, his reactions made sense to me, further heightening my suspicions about what I was being told by him. So the twist towards the end fell flat - it was as if I already knew deep down and was just waiting for it to be revealed.</p>
<p>Oh, and I was waiting a lot of time throughout the book. 2/3rds in and there is hardly anything that takes place. To me, the love story between Mike and Ellie was not interesting. The way it played out was dull. It got tiring at one point to read Mike <em>tell</em> what was happening. The suspense around Gipsy&rsquo;s Acre wasn&rsquo;t built at all. It was supposed to be a &ldquo;gothic story with gypsy&rsquo;s warnings&rdquo; - wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>This may have been a brilliant psychological thriller for its time. But a lot has happened since 1967 and too many have been inspired by the style of surpriseful narration from this mystery master for this style to create the necessary impression anymore. This read was so unlike any other from Agatha Christie and this time it is not in positive sense.</p>

			 <p>I have a pretty common first name (or given name as it is called at some places). It&rsquo;s so common that even the movie characters with my name have rarely had any significant part to play.

And has such a complex tone to it &ndash; it&rsquo;s new every time I hear it. And if I think I&rsquo;ve already heard it, they adorn the spelling with an extra &ldquo;z&rdquo;. Fantastic!</p>
<p>Having a common first name sucks. Having it end with an equally common surname sucks more.

<p>That also the reason why I respect <a href="https://micro.blog/amit">the service</a> where I could get that username with just my first name. Uhm!</p>
<p>Of course, if your aim in life is just to get lost in the crowd, be not know or just be, have a common name. But who wants that? <em>Right? RIGHT?</em></p>

<p>Not for me though - am not (yet) a paying Dropbox customer. I don&rsquo;t know till when that can last. Appears to me that all services I use are reconsidering their free tiers.</p>

			 <p>I know password manager's an important service and one shouldn't hesitate to pay for it. But LastPass's free tier was a good enough option for me; there was no feature that I needed to pay the subscription price for. That changed with today's modifications to that free tier.</p>
<p>
  That update also made me reevaluate my options. And I realized 1Password is a better option <i>for me</i> -- both in terms of the features and the cost it charges (especially in Indian market).
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  So I've ditched LastPass the moment they asked me to pay. Is that cheating?

<p>This one had a pretty interesting storyline with lots of twists and red herring peppered across the chapters. Having said that, I wish the writing in the middle third was a lot more crisp. It gets too simplistic, slips into a narrative style of <em>telling</em> what&rsquo;s playing out. I would have lost the patience, but it was the rapid pacing of the plot that kept me going. Also it has a few subplots and characters that should have been edited out - it becomes tiresome to follow towards the end.</p>
<p>With all said, this is a promising debut nonetheless by Raman with a welcome, quick read with an Indian setting.</p>

			 <p>I was fascinated to learn about the so called town under one roof - Whittier. It has to be one of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/heres-what-its-like-to-visit-whittier-alaska-the-town-under-one-roof/slidelist/51542206.cms">the most isolated places</a> <em>which people call home</em>. I have so many questions about how the residents of this town <em>make</em> this place a home, how the isolation, the sameness affects them. It mustn&rsquo;t be easy.</p>
<p>I was mesmerized by this how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLnEHiIMohM">Michael Stevens describes</a> what the town must represent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The earth around Whittier is not always a friendly place. But so long as people call it home, Whittier stands as a magnificent gesture of defiance. Of human engineering. And the strength of inertia, of our desire to stay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more I think about it, maybe the life of us city dwellers is no less isolated than the residents of Whittier. Sure, they are stuck in one same building, surrounded on all sides by rocks. But so are we - if not physically, mentally we have caged ourselves.</p>

It, for a long time, defined what a war movie is and had <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NXZr9exURTg">a song</a> that describes the pain of a soldier better than any movie ever could.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve got a few minor (?) feature requests for Micro.blog hosting based on my limited experience with the service. I think these features will further heighten and simplify the experience.</p>
<ol>
<li>I wish the edit buttons were available on the posts in the timeline, for example, right next to the remove option.  The availability of the remove option makes me believe the context is already available. Also, I understand an option to edit the original posts from blogs not hosted by Micro.blog might be tricky, but I hope Manton finds some simple solution, as he usually does.</li>
<li>I believe the edit for the replies is far simpler in comparison and should really avoid all the hoops one has to go through today, just for minor fixes.</li>
<li>Just the way, the whole site can be archived to GitHub automatically, I wish the custom theme can be too. It would help to track all the changes being made to the site design. Without the option, I need to manually set up and check-in the changes to the repository. And given how easy it is to update the custom theme from the browser, it just feels natural to allow backing up the theme as a git repository.</li>
<li>Currently, the spell checks and Grammarly plugin does not work in the post drafting <code>textarea</code>. I am not yet sure why, but it makes the posts very prone to errors.</li>
<li>This is way down the list (literally), but I wish the drafts are auto-saved while composing longer posts. I do not want to lose a draft just because I closed a window by mistake.</li>
</ol>
<p>Possibly these items are already on Manton&rsquo;s backlog list but just aren&rsquo;t prioritized. In which case, here&rsquo;s an added vote for these features.</p>

			 <p>With the way IPL has played out this year, I&rsquo;m sure the mood in many teams room is a tad dreary. Many performances picked up late causing reshuffle of the points table towards the later half. Though only Mumbai Indians have been consistent, I hope we get a new champion.</p>

			 <p>I just created an <a href="https://letterboxd.com/am1tg/">account at Letterboxd</a>, I&rsquo;ve been delaying this for no reason. I love Goodreads because I can track and get the recommendations for books. I&rsquo;m sure Letterboxd will do the same for movies.</p>
<p>I wonder though, can I <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/sairat/">rate a movie high, yet still not like it</a>?</p>

			 <p>I came across this <a href="https://www.baty.net/2017/wordpress-is-a-typewriter/">opinion from Jack Baty</a> about static sites and I completely agree with him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[P]ublishing a static site is like sending a document to a printer. I have to make sure everything is connected, that there’s paper in the machine, and then wait for the job to finish before seeing the output. If something needs editing, and something always needs editing, the whole process starts over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a time when I enjoyed building my site with Hugo, but I never got comfortable with the writing flow then. Once I got tired and moved away, I&rsquo;d made up my mind that I won&rsquo;t ever sign up for a static site for my blog again. I firmly believe that blogs aren&rsquo;t the right candidates for static site generators.</p>
<p>Blogging platforms need to be light, free - something that static site generators, with the way they are setup, can never be. Jack&rsquo;s got just the right metaphor to express my thoughts. Writing <em>does</em> feel like priting a document with static sites.</p>

			 <p>I really enjoyed Aaron Sorkin&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_trial_of_the_chicago_7">The Trial of the Chicago 7</a> - it was an absorbing account of an event I didn&rsquo;t have much information about. I usually like the well-made courtroom dramas and this one was no different. And I also usually <em>love</em> Sorkin&rsquo;s method of telling stories and, again, this one was no different.</p>
<p>Though debatable, Sorkin is a master of narrating true stories, keeping you glued to the screen as he unravels more details about the story. He has also mastered his signature style to blend varying and often opposing, narratives and perspectives without letting the drama drag any moment. Even though I didn&rsquo;t know much about the event, I was completely involved and moved at many moments.</p>
<p>Also, as I was watching the trial play out, I thought Sorkin must have taken a lot of liberty in presenting the facts &ndash; especially the actions of Judge Hoffman. <em>No human can be such an asshole</em>, I thought. So the first thing I did was to check how closely were the event and the trial presented. I was surprised to find that most of <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2020/10/trial-chicago-seven-aaron-sorkin-accuracy-netflix.html">the key moments shown were true</a> &ndash; even the judge&rsquo;s behaviour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As unbelievable as it seems, Judge Hoffman, born in 1895, really did act with the malice shown in the film, dismissing objections from the defense before they were made and arbitrarily excluding evidence, witnesses, and even jurors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Horrible!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The lady on the microphone announced in her squeaky voice, &ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Mumbai airport.&rdquo; Oas groaned, closed his eyes, and contorted his face like only an exasperated 75-year-old can. Having heard her numerous times in the last couple of hours, he was tired of listening to her any more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she think I&rsquo;ve never been to an airport before?&rdquo; he muttered under his breath. &ldquo;Bah. I&rsquo;ve been on planes for longer than she&rsquo;s been on earth!&rdquo; The staff was running helter-skelter on the airport with some angst that Oas couldn&rsquo;t fathom. &ldquo;<em>Freaks</em>,&rdquo; he sighed in disappointment.</p>
<p>The constant low hum of the music from the headphones of the young guy beside Oas didn&rsquo;t help his mood either. As the guy shuffled in his seat, the huge laptop on his lap brushed against Oas&rsquo;s arm again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want my lap too?&rdquo; Oas blurted out loudly as he knew the guy couldn&rsquo;t hear him. &ldquo;Take it, I am happy to help you save the world which is what I assume you must be doing,&rdquo; he continued muttering. The guy hardly budged.</p>
<p>Bored of the one-way conversation, Oas got up and stood gawking at the hustle-bustle around. He was a lost alien amidst the time-poor professionals. He walked to a television screen in the lounge playing CNN. A news scroll read about a novel disease spreading through China. The main news being run on the channel though was about a kid at the Mumbai airport traveling alone. Oas massaged his forehead in disdain, wondered why this was news, and walked away.</p>
<p>He began to stroll around the airport. He had to buy nothing, but he also dearly wanted to interact with another human being. He wandered through the Crosswords bookstore, hoping a salesperson would ask him if he needed any help. No one did. Lacking the patience to browse around the towering walls of disparate books, he walked straight to the bestseller section. He glanced at all the self-help books crowding the non-fiction racks. The fiction ones were full of tales from fantasy
worlds. Oas was fond of neither; so he strolled out. </p>
<p>He saw a deserted coffee stall. Hoping that the person selling coffee would be as bored as he was, Oas walked to him. The person was seated on a low stool chair; to Oas&rsquo;s disappointment, even he was lost in his smartphone&rsquo;s screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s hot?&rdquo; Oas asked the guy with a wish it would trigger some small talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We only sell coffee here,&rdquo; responded the guy without glancing away from the glowing screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you serve it hot?&rdquo; Oas quipped.</p>
<p>The guy hadn&rsquo;t looked at Oas yet; he didn&rsquo;t even now. He jerked his face towards the coffee vending machine and said, &ldquo;We serve it however this machine dispenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With all his hopes for even a meaningless interaction crushed, Oas ordered a cup. The guy shrugged in annoyance, got up and walked to the machine. He served the coffee with eyes as dull as sloth&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Sorry to put you through so much trouble, my friend,&rdquo; mocked Oas. The sarcasm in his voice was lost on the mindless guy. He responded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a bitter taste in his mouth, Oas walked back to the gate buzzing now with the regular pre-boarding bustle. A lot of people had gotten up in the anticipation that the queuing would start soon. &ldquo;<em>Would they prefer to stand up longer just to be ahead in the boarding queue?&quot;</em> Oas wondered. <em>&ldquo;Just so that they could sit inside the plane longer?&quot;</em> The rationality behind the thought had always stumped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Puri?&rdquo; Oas heard a soft voice calling for him. He turned to face a flight attendant, smiling a very plastic smile at him.  The nametag on her read &lsquo;Anjali&rsquo;. Oas stopped himself from telling her that she had unnecessarily puffed her face with makeup. She had helped Oas earlier at the check-in counter; he had stopped himself even then. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you please follow me?&rdquo; It sounded more like a command to Oas than a request.</p>
<p>He looked at her, puzzled. He couldn&rsquo;t think of any reason why he should follow her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok, Anjali,&rdquo; he said curtly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need any help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, we have a priority boarding policy for all the senior citizens,&rdquo; she spoke without letting her two pepper-red lips touch one another for long. &ldquo;We will get you on the plane first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oas stared at her like a child would at his examiner. <em>&ldquo;Why does the world make us elders feel a lot more helpless than we are?&quot;</em> He didn&rsquo;t have much choice though; the stewardess looked adamant. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine. But I would need to be taken care of. I don&rsquo;t want to get stuffed in and forgotten,&rdquo; instructed Oas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t happen, sir.&rdquo; The plastic smile didn&rsquo;t leave Anjali&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Oas followed her. He was stuffed into the plane. And forgotten.</p>
<hr>
<p>Oas looked at the kid from the CNN news report boarding along with Anjali. He wished the kid wasn&rsquo;t sitting anywhere close to him. Sure, Oas was yearning for interaction with another human being, but he was convinced that kids didn&rsquo;t fit that category. He did not hate them. He just believed they were dispatched by God to make people live through misery right on earth for the sins they have committed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kids are too clumsy,&rdquo; he used to tell his wife, Sara, &ldquo;and too stupid to spend any time with. All they can do is leave you more frustrated than you were before.&rdquo; Sara, on the other hand, believed they were godsent to spread joy amongst the grieving souls, to teach them valuable lessons about life. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why God sent us no child. We are not grieving, you see.&rdquo; She used to joke with tears soon shimmering in her eyes. Oas let her settle with her fantasy.</p>
<p>Oas saw the kid follow Anjali till they reached right next to where he was seated. She started pushing the kid&rsquo;s backpack inside the overhead compartment. Oas dropped his face in his palm; the kid saw him do that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avik, this is your seat, right next to nice Mr Puri here,&rdquo; introduced Anjali. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you would enjoy your flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oas saw the kid slide onto the seat next to him and blurt, &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Avik shuffled into his seat by the aisle. He looked towards the open overhead compartment. Then he stuck his neck out into the empty aisle. He wanted to see someone around; he didn&rsquo;t. Displeasure cloaked his innocent face. He then looked at Oas who had picked up a magazine and was clearly pretending to be engrossed in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you reading, Mr Puri?&rdquo; Avik was looking curiously at Oas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that will interest you,&rdquo; Oas answered curtly without looking at him once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you like reading Mr Puri,&rdquo; continued Avik. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look too interested in that book. My mum says if you enjoy doing something, you are always very busy doing it. So much that you won&rsquo;t even answer a question from someone else.&rdquo; Avik had pulled out the envelope kept in the seatback pocket and rummaged through what was inside. &ldquo;I never answer my mum when I am watching cartoons, you know, because I looooveee cartoons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Avik was doing nothing to thwart Oas&rsquo;s beliefs about kids, rather, he was only making them firmer. &ldquo;Why are you alone, kid? Why are you not with your mum?&rdquo; Oas asked while putting the magazine back into the envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in Bangalore. My father is also in Bangalore,&rdquo; said Avik while pulling out the printed safety instruction manual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are <em>you</em> not with your mum?&rdquo; Oas asked again, thinking, &ldquo;of course <em>kids never answer the question that&rsquo;s asked&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they are not in Mumbai?&rdquo; Avik shook his head a couple of times and continued staring at the pictures in the security manual. &ldquo;I was living with my grandma here. She is very old &ndash;&rdquo; Avik paused and looked at Oas&rsquo;s face again. &ldquo;Not as old as you, though. But she still says she can&rsquo;t fly; she says she is afraid.&rdquo; Avik wasn&rsquo;t accustomed to staying silent. &ldquo;I am not afraid at all. My mum says I am very strong.&rdquo; Oas himself had started rummaging through the envelope now, searching for
headphones that he could plug his ears with. &ldquo;She says I am stronger than all my friends in the school. Rohit, Sid, everyone. Neil does beat me sometimes, but I always hit him back. My mum says I am stronger than even my father. My father -&rdquo; Oas had found the headphones and had quickly plugged his ears shut. He looked at Avik; he could see his lips
move, but heard no sound at all. He breathed a sigh of relief. He was happy that he had booked a first-class ticket; at least they provided the customers noise-cancelling headphones.</p>
<p>Oas saw Anjali standing by the gate welcoming the other passengers that were boarding the flight now. He watched a couple enter the flight with a baby. The father was walking in front carrying all the luggage. The new-mom was struggling to carry the baby through the narrow aisle without letting even its sock touch anybody around. <em>&ldquo;That kid&rsquo;s going to wail throughout the flight now.&quot;</em> Oas let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>The guy with the huge laptop under his arm and headphones over his head walked in next. Oas smirked looking at him. &ldquo;The Avenger,&rdquo; he muttered and chuckled at his joke.</p>
<p>Oas felt a pat on his arm; Avik was gesturing at him to remove his headphones. Oas didn&rsquo;t want to, but Avik had shifted his attention to work the seat belt that was holding him in his place. Worried the kid would set himself free, he pulled them away and gave Avik a probing look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what I was saying, Mr Puri?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t. You see &hellip;&rdquo; Oas pointed at his headphones. &ldquo;&hellip; I was listening to music. Now that is something I like doing, kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you keep calling me &lsquo;kid&rsquo;? Everyone else calls me &lsquo;Avik&rsquo;. My mum says she spent many days thinking before she settled on that name. You know what it means?&rdquo; Without waiting for Oas to speak a word, he bent his arms, flexing his biceps. &ldquo;It means brave, just who I am, my mum says. But she always cries when she says that, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last statement made Oas freeze in his place. He saw a moving image flash in front of his eyes; of Sara hunched down next to Oas, laughing and crying at the same time. <em>&ldquo;Oh, I know you are brave, Oas!&quot;</em> He could recall Sara lying to him, preparing him for something he just wasn&rsquo;t ready for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does she cry?&rdquo; He asked Avik in a much softer voice suddenly.</p>
<p>Avik shrugged, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He continued his assault on the seat belt.</p>
<p>Oas continued to stare at the kid, gloomy thoughts clouding his mind. Feeling increasingly restless, he asked, &ldquo;Are you going back to your mum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m. Grandma says my mum&rsquo;s missing me. She always misses me.&rdquo; Avik had given up on his fight with the seat belt. &ldquo;Who are you going back to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one. I am going back to being alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone? Do you like living alone? Don&rsquo;t you have a family? My mum says everyone has one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The innocence in the kid&rsquo;s voice caught Oas off guard. &ldquo;I had, once. I don&rsquo;t now since my wife. . . uhmmm. . . you know - &quot; Oas wasn&rsquo;t sure if the kid was old enough to understand the concept of death. This was one more reason he didn&rsquo;t like spending time with kids. &ldquo;<em>They could keep making the mindless fart jokes around you, but say &lsquo;shit&rsquo; around a kid and the whole world starts judging you,&quot;</em> he always complained. Sara was good at manoeuvring such situations; Oas wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Did your wife die?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Oas was taken aback by this unexpected straightforwardness. He gulped the heaviness of the moment down his throat and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she did love you, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Oas nodded again. &ldquo;So, why are you alone then? She must be still around, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oas looked at the kid expressionless. His mind was full of questions that he knew he would get no answers for from this unripe mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mum says the people that love you do not go anywhere even if they die. They do disappear but continue to stay around. They never leave you.&rdquo; He was busy unfolding and folding the tray table over his lap now. &ldquo;My mum says she also is never going to leave me alone. I don&rsquo;t know why she keeps saying that; I know she won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone around had settled down into their seats now. A calmness spread through the plane that Oas didn&rsquo;t share. Uneasy, he stared out the window into the darkness outside, illuminated by the occasional flash of lightning. Within, he was storming through the dreary thoughts.</p>
<p>Anjali was now ready with the security demonstrations. She was used to being ignored, but the kid craned his neck to take in every word she said. Oas, on the other hand, was lost in his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uhhh &hellip; Why do they rush through these security instructions? Do they even want people to understand them?&rdquo; Oas looked at him struggling with the seat belt again. He finally got it open and squeaked an enthusiastic &ldquo;yay&rdquo;.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Cabin crew, prepare for take-off please.&quot;</em> Oas heard the Captain announce. Avik was jumping up and down on his seat; he didn&rsquo;t look alone any more. Oas unbuckled his seat belt, stretched towards the kid and put him back tied to his seat belt. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you unbuckle the seat belt now. Your mum won&rsquo;t want you to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Avik settled back into his seat. Oas locked his stare at the darkness outside. The flight took off, passing through the stormy clouds. The raindrops pattered against the window and then stopped suddenly as the plane cut through the low dark clouds.</p>
<p>Avik had unknowingly slid his hand around Oas&rsquo;s arm. Oas smiled at Avik. &ldquo;Your mum&rsquo;s right. You <em>are</em> a brave child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yesterday marked the beginning of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navaratri">Navratri</a>, a nine-day festival for us Indians. And again, as has been the trend this year, the festivities are dampened by the phantom presence and talks of pandemic rampaging outside. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each year, Ganesh Chaturthi, the long 10-day festival begins the season of festivals here in India. Everyone accepts that once the August dawns, it never is too long when we are already ringing the new year celebrations. We and our families are too busy with one festival after another. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year the festivals did arrive, but the festivities were lacking. In India, we love celebrating our festivals outside, and with others. With our extended families and friends. We welcome them at home, and we don't hesitate to visit them and wish them loads of happiness.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So no surprise this year's festivals have been a lot different and a lot less fun. I understand the gravity of the situation that all us in the world find ourselves trapped in. But we Indians are known to dance away our fears and stresses together, as we celebrate our festivals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From North to South, East to West of India, there are different names for the each (and at times the same) festival. But the purpose is common - celebrate the feeling of togetherness and of happiness that that togetherness brings to us. In that sense, this year has been dampening. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, Navratri began yesterday. Unlike each year, we are all working from home and hence have got a chance <a href="https://amitgawande.com/slacking-at-hometown/">to be with our parents</a>. Usually, my wife and my mother fast throughout these nine days of Navratri. They are not changing there routine, they will fast even this year. To keep me appreciative of how difficult that is, I have decided to fast today. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the DJs blaring the loud sounds from the <em>pandals </em>set up for Garba are missing this year. Also missing are the endless debates between left and right on how we should stop spreading the noise pollution. Missing are the colourful stalls selling Gagra cholis and missing is the excitement of getting ready as per the colour schedule for each Garba night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sure, I understand the reason for all the gloom and also realize that we have bigger problems in front of us. But I abhor this year because it's stripping away the opportunities from us to celebrate and gain the strength we need to face the problems.</p>

<p>That sentiment is a lot stronger for me in today's times of a pandemic that spreads by touching any of the open holes on a human's face. I'm tensed anytime I'm to touch my own face these days, especially if I don't have a hand wash or sanitizer around. I hate this crazy, fucking virus. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can stop eating particular meat or can boil &amp; reboil the water before drinking it. You can kill all the mosquitos around or have yourself bathed in repellant. But how the fuck do you not touch your own face? That's like asking your kid to not put herself in harm's way - she invariably will.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, with the bottled up frustration out of the way, my dislike for shopping for deodorant isn't new. So much so that it's no longer just a harmless dislike, it's a feeling of extreme hate. How the hell do you decide if a deodorant is good or not? I don't know how it's done at other places, but here in India, trying out a fragrance from a tester pack is pretty common while shopping for a deodorant. Everybody does it. Everybody apparent can do it. Except me. I never learned how to keep the fragrances separate. Once I've tried two, everything smells the same to my picky nose - you might as well make me smell the water and still get a comment from me after that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The way-out for me earlier was that I would only try a couple and select one from those. I can't say it always works - I end up choosing one that smells the worst. <em>Too strong or too mild or yuck. </em>These are the only reactions I get from my family. I haven't let that affect me until now - I have managed to convince myself that no one likes how the other smells. As long as I'm happy with how I smell - <em>or there's a complete lack of any form of smell for that matter</em> - I was fine. So I bought whatever smelled best for me or didn't smell at all from the two I tried.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This trial for fragrances is out of the picture in the pandemic times. There just are too many logistical problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What's the other way then? You can for once judge a book by its cover or title, but there's no way one can judge a deodorant by its canister. I mean all fucking look the same. You can't select one because its nozzle opens up funny or the shape of the container is "different". The content isn't.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And what's with naming the fragrances? Dark Temptation, Sea Drift, Thunder Bolt, Regal Burst, Voyage. When every fragrance could be named as simply as "strong", "mild" and "mildest", fact that marketing would spend so much time and money to come up with these names makes no sense to me. How am I supposed to select between Dark Temptation and Gold Temptation?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the money that marketing spends on the advertisement for men's deodorant must absolutely go down the drain. The only message they aim to deliver apparently is <em>put this on and be a magnet for girls</em>? Or be sensual? Or be "irresistible"? On the other hand, how can you even advertise for fragrance? The only thing you can say is it smells good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or simply strong, mild or mildest. I'm telling you, it is simple to solve this problem. Just use those names.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, I went shopping for deodorant today again. Looking at me struggling, toying around with all black canisters, the store owner pulled all the options away, kept one in front of me and said, "you will love this, sir, trust me". That won't have done it, but then he added, "you will click a picture of this and come again next time asking for this one".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once I returned home with that deodorant, I minutely stared at my reflection in the mirror, wondering what <a href="https://amitgawande.com/small-town-diaries-shopping/">in the way I dressed</a> gave that store owner the feeling that I can't read English.</p>

I didn't like it at all - such a disappointing finale for a brilliant series overall. With unnecessary blabbering and too much of <em>gyan</em>, it just went downhill with each episode. About an hour-long final one was a drag - half-an-hour too long, maybe. I wonder which are the shows that have a timely, yet brilliant end - where once it's done, you go, "Is that over? So soon?" <em>The Newsroom</em>?</p>

<p>I enjoy reading books and essays in the humour genre the most. However, I find it extremely difficult to consistently find something funny that excites me. I look at the Goodreads recommendations for humour and all are memoir types. Or they were written a long time back. Is this genre just not explored anymore? Why do so few people write funny fiction?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having written <a href="https://amitgawande.com/tagged/tikwadi/">a few humour short stories</a> myself, I understand that it is an extremely difficult genre to master. You can't write something that <em>everyone</em> will find funny. Some will like what's written, while some will consider it to be absolutely silly, or even garbage. Maybe that's the reason not many want to go through the trouble of writing something that won't find universal acceptance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I do wonder, at times, that may be the issue is about discovery. Maybe a lot of good humour is written but I am not aware of it. If that's the case, I would like to know of them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So what's the best humour that you have recently read, preferably something that's not memoir (because am tired of reading short essays that are only funny in parts). I would love if they are pure fiction. Or fantasy even. I am ok to read anything and everything funny. Especially in today's dire times.</p>

<p>I read <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/sharpies" target="_blank">this heartfelt post at McSweeney's</a> by Jen Coleman, a high school English teacher, on children already returning to schools amidst the pandemic. It makes no sense to me that someone somewhere is making a decision that puts these budding souls at risk just so that the perception of "we, the leaders, are handling it well" can be maintained. I am happy in my developing country if that's how a developed one handles crises.</p>

<p>I finished reading the second book in The Rabbi Small Mysteries series, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/415640.Saturday_the_Rabbi_Went_Hungry" target="_blank">Saturday the Rabbi Went Hungry</a>. Though I enjoyed this story, the overall experience was a bit dampened by the political subplots and unnecessary chatters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sure, every discussion that Rabbi was involved in was, though repetitive, refreshing; it was a welcome lesson on Jewish traditions and values. However, unlike the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amitgawande.com/book-review-friday-the-rabbi-slept-late/" target="_blank">first book in the series</a>, the mystery and the rabbi didn't feel like the core of this one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>A good quick read, nonetheless.</p>

<p>If there's one positive change that the lockdown has brought into my routine, it would be that I am reading a lot more, both online essays &amp; books. My <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/21425016-amit?shelf=currently-reading" target="_blank">Goodreads currently reading list</a> is full of some wonderful books. It is a result of some intentional changes in my habit and the easy availability of a lot of free time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am "reading" a lot more books in their audio forms. The Audible subscription has been one of the best investments. I enjoy listening to books as I am doing other tasks. Be it the regular household choir or exercising. So if I am thoroughly involved in a book, it clearly shows in my walk/run times. I would go on long walks just to "read" more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, I <a href="https://amitgawande.com/read-patiently-slowly/">have since long stopped carrying my mobile phone</a> with me - rather I keep my Kindle around. I always take it along as I move through my routine. This is my observation when I had first started following this habit a while back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I take my kindle, walk to my balcony or to my terrace or to the garden and settle there. Without my phone. Or my iPad. Anyone needs my attention, they have to come and fetch me. And I realised I was back to being more earnest while reading.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This holds even today. So whenever my mind reaches out for some getaway, it's the list of books that is accessible. Not some social media feed. Or emails. No risk of doom-scrolling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have also realized that I can't read only one book at a time. What I want to read depends on a lot many external factors. My mood, the weather, what and who am surrounded by, the thoughts my mind is full of. So I have a list of 10 books that I am reading at any given time based on these factors. And I don't hold myself to add another to the list if none of these excites me some time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being a completionist has been a habit that I was proud of one time; that's not the case any more. If a book is unable to hold my attention, I will stop reading it. I will skip chapters if it is non-fiction to see if there's any other chapter that interests me. There are more pages that we can eagerly turn than there are minutes that we can breathe. Don't touch a book that doesn't keep you excited to turn to the next page.</p>

<p>Through some wonderful recommendations from folks I have learnt to trust now, I came across this brilliant <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/53104-the-rabbi-small-mysteries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mystery series</a> featuring one of the most likeable characters I have read, Rabbi Small. I enjoy reading mystery as a genre the most - in that <em>whodunit</em> has a special place in my mind. It is the most difficult genre to write effectively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This short read falls in the category that Agatha Christie had mastered -- the story unravels itself for both the reader and the central characters together. Everything is laid out in front of the reader with nothing being held back by the "intelligent" detective. I hate the I-knew-it-all-along sort of twists. The mysteries that don't employ such ploys can leave you with satisfaction that is of the highest order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is not the underlying mystery that charmed me though. It is the sincere presentation of Jewish culture in a small-town community of Barnard's Crossing, notwithstanding the humorous undertone that author Harry Kemelman maintains throughout. I loved the setting of the lovable town and the characters big and small - I connected with each one of them. I enjoyed the discussions that David Small gets into every now and then, for that matter right from the get-go when he untangles the middling mystery of a broken vehicle with his simple, basic yet effective method of listening. I knew right away that I was in for an enjoyable ride.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is an intelligent book with a common, sincere central character. He is not the only intelligent being around - each supporting character is important and equally worthy. I loved Rabbi Small's bantering with Chief Lanigan on topics both related and unrelated to the mystery. The later, equally smart, is not there just to hear the detective unravel the mystery towards the end. He is involved too. In that manner, this book is special.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I haven't been this engaged while reading a book, or to find what happens next since a long time now. And I don't remember the last time when I rushed to pick the second book in the series this soon. I think it was when <a href="https://amitgawande.com/book-review-and-then-there-were-none/">I read Christie for the first time</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would recommend this to anyone interested in a light, cosy mystery and is ok to not be held up in the cleverness of the plot or presentation. The simplicity, then, will win you over.</p>

<p>On a serious note, am really looking forward to the availability of trade-in, AppleCare+ and Apple support. Of course, I am sure the cost won't be too low for any of that.

<p>I felt very close to the rain today. I don't like to get drenched in a downpour. Or to get damp in a drizzle. As a child, I used to sit at the edge of the <em>veranda</em> and watch the rain play its games. I did that again today after a long, <em>long </em>time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The clouds gave way to a slight drizzle and eventually burst into an angry downpour. I slumped into the swing chair in the <em>veranda</em> and grinned as the wind lead the stream of raindrops as part of their lovely waltz. I instinctively stretched out my leg to the rain in the hope that nature's playfulness on show rubbed onto me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It did; I felt calm, devoid of the stress that I had become so habitual to recently. I experienced a general sense of clarity within, but I wasn't thinking about anything specific. A numbness of mind that moves you meaningfully? I wish I could better word this paradox.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My recent lifestyle of the bustling metropolis has made me ignorant. When it rained, I hid behind glass with the raindrops furiously colliding against it. But then they dejectedly glided down. Not today. I let them touch me, heal me today.</p>

<p>When I began <a href="https://amitgawande.com/newsletter-early-access/">the little side project</a> about ten weeks back, I hadn't set any specific expectations from it. Or from myself. I had an itch, an idea for sharing my interest in everything about writing with other folks who share my passion. I wanted to explore the newsletter as a medium to reach out to other people. It was only natural to bring them together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had no idea at that time that more than 2 months down, I would still be pumped to word each issue with care every week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the risk of getting cheesy about a random number, the 10th <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/amitgawande/issues/the-tangle-of-language-system-272098">issue of Slanting Nib &amp; A Keyboard newsletter</a> needed a special mention. I paused before publishing the issue in haste in the last week. I <a href="https://amitgawande.com/slacking-at-hometown/">hadn't got enough time</a> to work on it. I wasn't happy with what I reviewed as I about to schedule it. So I skipped sharing any issue in the last week. I took the time again and reworded the whole issue. And it is out today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It features some insightful essays that attempt to decipher and explain the past, present and the future of the complex obscurity that is language. I enjoyed reading each one of them; they made me appreciate the intricacies of human communication. It made me wonder that maybe the languages evolved because we human beings are an intelligent species. However, possibly we evolved into an intelligent species because we had the backing of complex languages. Maybe both.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, do give it a read online; this one is a special one for me. If what you read interests you, <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/amitgawande">please subscribe</a>. If you are already subscribed and have been enjoying the issues, I will appreciate if you forward them to your friends. And any which way, I would love to hear from you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am planning to rework the structure of the newsletter a bit without losing on the core idea. I will share more details as they crystallize in my mind. If you think any aspect is just not working, do let me know. It would help me make some easy decisions.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2020/08/31/231150.html">Small Town Diaries - Shopping</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2020/08/31/231150.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-08-31 23:11:50 &#43;0530">Aug 31, 2020</time></a>

			 <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I went casual shopping today. I didn't dress up as I would normally do whenever I go out in my hometown. How I look as I go outside does not matter to me much these days. Anyway, all I had to shop for was some groceries and a few ointments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The way I looked today was fine for the larger town I have settled in. Rather the shabbier I dress up, greater the respect I gain from a store owner. Or so I believe. This theory fails royally in my comparatively smaller hometown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As expected, I was consciously ignored by the store owners and the attendants. I, then, asked for a specific item, a Himalaya - a well-known Indian brand - face cream. I returned the Himalaya face gel asking for the cream variant. And it is then that they called me "sir". </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This incident repeated itself at another store. My shabby attire made everyone attending in the store to ignore me. I then asked for a lip balm of from Nivea. I returned the strawberry flavoured one he hesitantly handed me and asked for a variant that's especially for men. It is then that they called me "sir".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have realized over the years (and from the sheer amount of effort my dad puts in dressing up just to go out of the main door) that it matters here how you present yourself outside - especially in shops as a customer. However, if a shabby looking attire makes the store owners and attendants ignore you, the <em>specificity</em> of your wants makes you special.</p>

<p>Ever since I <a href="https://amitgawande.com/sn-issue-9/">travelled back to my hometown</a>, I have not been able to keep up with my routine. I’m not sure of the reasons, but things have been tricky.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One reason I believe is my mindset. For years now, I have been travelling to this place, to my other home, only on vacations. I would take long leaves, be off work and spend some relaxed time in the city where I’ve spent the majority of my early years. I feel I’ve grown accustomed to the air here and now I associate it with relaxation. Hence it has been extremely difficult to do anything else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve been sleeping a lot more. I’ve been eating a lot more. I’ve been slacking a lot more. I can do my office work, that doesn’t seem to be affected. But every other routine task is. I was waiting for things to naturally get back to normal. 2 weeks in and I don’t think there’s any chance of that happening. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So I am forcing myself now to get back into the routine. Time to bring the diaries, the journals back. Get the diet, the focus apps out. Reset those snoozed alarms again. Close eyes for those mindful 2 minutes. Stare regularly at the blinking cursor.</p>

			 <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I recently took a big decision to travel across the state and temporarily settle down into my hometown. Closer to my family and friends. I'm anyway working from home. So it doesn't matter how far away from the office I actually am. It wasn't an easy decision, but a strong desire to break the monotonous routine made it a lot clear. So over the weekend, I and my close family travelled and have begun to settle into a new place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consequently, I could hardly find time for everything that was routine for me. One of them is the weekly issue of my newsletter. With just a couple of days in hand, the self-doubt had started clouding my mind, making me question whether I'm on the right track. <em>Should I continue to spend time on publishing the weekly issues? Would I have enough time to curate each issue to make it interesting? Am I failing at another side project?</em> A timely comment from a reader cleared the doubts. And it also gave me the topic for the next issue; I cleaned the slate and started curating it afresh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/amitgawande/issues/failing-is-easy-do-it-well-270554">this week's issue of Slanting Nib &amp; A Keyboard</a>, I feature the essays that, in no way, preach how the fear of failure can be, should be overcome. Rather they attempt to persuade that it is all fine to fail. I needed the nudge myself. Each of these essays lent that to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Do give it a read online. If what you read interests you, <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/amitgawande">please subscribe</a>. If you are already subscribed and have been enjoying the issues, I will appreciate if you forward them to your friends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>PS:</strong> The issue also has a glaring mistake -- so fitting to let the first one (that I know of) slip through in an issue about failing.</p>

It features a few essays from the masters who have, over the years, learned to command the art by confronting each of the factors that drive every writer or a creative mind to satisfaction - inspiration, focus and craft. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had to delay this issue by an hour as I could not complete my final review in time. It was a race against meeting the deadline and the last-minute call from work made it all the more difficult. I usually find the links that I want to feature way ahead of time. However, I carefully include the comments later to be sure about <em>why </em>I'm including the link as part of the issue. I had to rush through the commentary part today. So, if you find the description slightly incoherent, my planning-gone-wrong is to blame - a learning experience to not trudge too close to the deadline.</p>

<p>I need to stop treating the weekends as special. I stay up late on the night before, ergo I get up late. <em>I am getting more lone time</em>, I convince myself. I have now realized that's not the case. The late nights can give me some hours when all are asleep. But I enjoy the early mornings much more. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am fresh, I can sit and relax with calmness surrounding me. No one's awake. Not in my house or on the outside. The only "noise" is the crickets in the dark, busy with their routine; that calms me. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I get to hear the nature wake itself up to the rising dawn. I need not plug my ears to shut out any distracting sounds. Every sound is stimulating; I read better, I write better. As someone who gets distracted by the slightest of the noises, that's also the best time to get into a <a href="https://amitgawande.com/i-cant-medidate/">meditative state</a>, something I am trying to do daily now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My habit of treating weekends as different from the regular work days has been ruining the routine that keeps me freshest throughout the day.</p>

<p>I always wonder what drives the journalists that sit in their air-conditioned newsrooms to go on a monologue. Questioning every other person, related to every news that has happened today. Or yesterday. Or in the last week. Or in the last year. The freshness, the relevance of the news they are reporting on, commenting on does not matter to them. What matters is their perceived notion that a journalism degree gives them a right to question, to mock, and these days, even scold everyone else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They scold; absolutely pointing and shouting at their "guests". Of course, even these "guests" know they are only here for getting scolded. There are those guests that get all the attention, all the respect. And then there are the remaining asses warming the chairs in the studios. Many only get to talk for once or twice. I wonder do they themselves care. Or are they just picked randomly from the support staff?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is tiring to watch the debates on the news shows. Or the monologues that precede them. I've anyway long stopped watching any form of news for that matter. These anchors, though, need to remember that they are anchors, not judges.</p>

<p>Writing in Markdown is not always easy. If you are providing an interface, an editor of any form, you shouldn't force your users to write in markdown. Especially if you are expecting them to use your application on a mobile device. It's a complete mess on the smaller mobile screens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every time I've to write in Markdown on my smartphone, I shudder. Especially if I've to insert a link. Do not make me type all the markups. It is just not easy. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is a lot simpler to select some text and tap a button, either to make it bold or insert a link. Sure, insert the markup in the background or in the editor, I don't mind that. Just don't make me type the whole damn stars and brackets sequence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don't get me wrong. I love Markdown. It is the simplest markup format, a lot better than writing the posts as HTML. However, it's not too intuitive to write on the smaller screens, without a physical keyboard. </p>

<p>I recently watched <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://films.nationalgeographic.com/free-solo" target="_blank">Free Solo</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1917_2019" target="_blank">1917</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/greyhound" target="_blank">Greyhound</a>. Here are my thoughts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Free Solo</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was such a thrilling documentary. I have rarely used that adjective for a documentary. But this one is so very different. I cannot fathom someone's possession for their passion can blind them to the risks rather conspicuous to the rest. I was aware of the free soloing as a form of climbing. What took me by surprise was the level of planning that goes into the preparation. In hindsight, it was foolish of me to think that wasn't the case, that the act was spontaneous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1917</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I can't think of a better way to captures the immediacy of war than how <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/sam_mendes">Sam Mendes</a> does with 1917. The single-take narration grips one right from the beginning and never lets off even for a moment. I was with the characters throughout their journey, feeling their anxiety, their pain. I entered every new terrain, turned every dark corner equally uneasy. What Mendes and his cinematographer Roger Deakins manage to achieve is absolute brilliance. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and was left gasping by the end. A cinematic masterpiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Greyhound</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another war flick that, sure, aimed to be different. A fast-paced action thriller about battleships is not very common. However, the economical 75 minutes of the runtime itself felt too long. The fights felt repetitive and with no other thread to hold the plot together, it was easy to skip over. Tom Hanks sells the character though. However, I am tired now of seeing him play the perfect guy. He needs to play some grey characters now, someone with a few flaws. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Bonus - Quarantine Special</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also <em>finally</em> watched the Quarantine special episode of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8879940/" target="_blank">Mythic Quest</a>. This is <em>the</em> best show on Apple TV+, period. And this special episode was exactly what I needed now -- an understanding of what I and most of us are going through in current times. What's commendable is that it does so without giving up on the hilarity. As the episode came to the climax, it had me jumping with momentary joy. With my eyes full of happy, hopeful tears and my fists clenched, <em>[spoiler alert]</em> I joined Ian to shout out loud "Fuck you Coronavirus".</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2020/08/01/201108.html">Perfectionism Isn&#39;t Healthy</a></h1>

			 <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have been closely monitoring what affects my behaviour recently. One of the aspects that I'd identified was that I was always judging myself, was always thinking, analyzing my current actions for their effect on my future. I'd decided <a href="http://amitgawande.com/slow-down-be-present/">to stop doing that</a>. But while I wrote that, I hadn't realized that there is deeper malady there -- my subconscious quest to be a perfectionist. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was reading an essay <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-dangerous-downsides-of-perfectionism" target="_blank">about the downsides of perfectionism </a>from Amanda Ruggeri at BBC, it made me aware that I've also been affected by the same trait she was warning about. I want things to be done perfectly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At home. At work. With the activities that I do on my own. With my family. With my peers, my superiors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is that perfectionist voice within me that's constantly judging me, judging others. Even now, am thinking and rethinking on the ways I could word this prose. This paragraph. <em>Is it the best way to make my point?</em> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why? Why do I do that? It can't be healthy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even on Google, the first autocomplete suggestion for "Perfectionism" is "Perfectionism is a disease". I wouldn't term this trait as that -- I don't want to flippantly use a word while representing any form of mental disorder -- it ain't a "disease" for sure. However, even an offhand read through the internet would convince you that perfectionism can lead to a laundry list of such disorders. Anxiety. Depression. And much more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am not sure if my habit of aiming for perfection in every task is affecting my mood and my mind in any alarming way yet. However, I think it does lead me to procrastinate at times. <em>I don't have time now, will do it later "perfectly,"</em> I can hear my mind say every now and then.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, it's believed and acknowledged to be a vicious cycle - perfectionism, procrastination and paralysis. Or thought another way, it is the paralysis by analysis. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis" target="_blank">Analysis paralysis</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All this lead me to <a href="https://amitgawande.com/stop-overthinking/">a post I wrote back in 2013</a>, on exactly the same topic of over-analyzing, overthinking. And it was then that I had linked to this term of Analysis paralysis for the first time. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was 7 years ago. I believe I haven't managed to get rid of my trait yet. It might be time to think about getting rid of this habit. To not let my pursuit for things to be perfect to affect me, to paralyze me.</p>

<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/amitgawande/issues/library-is-a-space-ship-time-machine-and-much-more-265796" target="_blank">sixth issue of Slanting Nib &amp; A Keyboard newsletter</a> is out today. It features a few essays that depict what libraries mean to a few writers and what, according to them, they should mean to everyone else. A mix of prominent personalities out to corroborate, with their powerful words, the significance of library, and how a library is many things -- now that's something I wouldn't want to miss.</p>

<p>I subscribed to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://getpocket.com/premium" target="_blank">Pocket Premium</a> today. Recently, I have been reading a lot of articles on the web. And most of the times, it is on Pocket. I save the recommended articles from newsletters, blogs or Twitter to be read later and catch up on them towards the end of the day. Or when I have some free time at my hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What's in the Premium option that made me upgrade from the free tier, you ask? Well, first of all, I wanted to support a service that's part of Mozilla family. I've been a long time Instapaper user, but since <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/pocket-acquisition-mozilla/" target="_blank">Mozilla acquired Pocket</a>, I have been using the later as my primary read later service.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have also been using Pocket extensively to find the right articles to be included as part of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amitgawande.com/slanting-nib/" target="_blank">my newsletter</a>. I read a lot, heavily curate and include just a few of them. So my Pocket list and archive are always full of some great writings from many brilliant sources. I do not want to lose any of these wonderful essays.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to make Pocket a sort of my online reading library -- it's even better if it's permanent as Pocket promises with an upgrade to Premium. The upgrade also offers full-text search which comes handy when finding that one article that talked about some peculiar topic. The biggest draw was the unlimited highlighting. The 3 highlights that the free option offered was limiting when each long read that I saved was full of thoughts worthy of absorption and introspection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have paid for a year; the pricing that it offers in-app is worth my current extent of the use of the service. I will re-evaluate after a year again. For now, Pocket stays the service of my choice.</p>

<p>Finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits">Atomic Habits by James Clear</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn't want to read another self-help book. But this one had been recommended to me for so many days, so many times that I had to read this once. Going in, I absolutely knew what to expect of the book. I got just that. It just was structured well enough to keep me going.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>James Clear has got a nice framework in place -- make good habits obvious, attractive, easy and satisfying. One can understand why that is important. He also presents it with enough examples and detailed description. I just wish it was shorter. A few chapters feel repetitive and only to be there to meet the page count goal. We could trim almost a third of the book and it would still be equally effective.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, the rating is for the simple way James presents the framework. There's something to be learnt from this, for sure.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2020/07/24/224544.html">I don&#39;t know how to meditate</a></h1>

			 <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I recently wanted to attempt meditation again. I have already tried getting into a habit of regular meditation sessions many times before this. However, as always, even this time, I couldn't go through the sessions for any significant duration of time. I can't seem to understand what I am missing. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe my mind is just not wired to be able to get something out of the process. Or maybe my surrounding, my current lifestyle is too chaotic to lend me space, the time to meditate. Thoughts always rush into my mind. From work. From home. From things done well. From things not yet done. I would never get into the zone where I am listening to my breathing. Maybe I am just too distracted within.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the fact that meditation can probably help me overcome that inattention is also why it is even more frustrating that I can't appreciate this practice. I have heard many people claim how meditation calms their mind. Get the clarity of thoughts. Focus. So I feel this can help me be not this distracted. But then while I am meditating, I feel helpless to control how my mind wanders around. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have tried multiple apps. I have tried guided sessions. Nothing seems to help. At times, I am even judging the voice that guides me. And I just sigh in disappointment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had heard CGP Grey talk about a similar experience in <a href="https://youtu.be/XLBZLMinwfI?t=4348" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the episodes of Hello Internet</a> where he just can't get himself to meditate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I gave meditation a real try. It's not that I hate it. It's not that it's hard. It's just that my brain does not want to do this. It's really pushing back.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was nodding incessantly as Grey spoke about his frustration of not being able to appreciate the benefits of meditation. I feel equally frustrated when I hear someone talk about how the sessions leave them more mindful, more relaxed. It just doesn't do it for me.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2020/07/23/223000.html">Buying Experience with Time</a></h1>

			 <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I spent the last weekend idling around; I did not do anything that I have always considered "productive". No reading novels. Or catching up on my read later lists. Or writing. Or working on the short story in progress. Nothing. I spent the whole two days lying on my sofa, enjoying a movie marathon with my family. I did all that without judging myself, as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amitgawande.com/slow-down-be-present/" target="_blank">I had recently decided</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's <em>so </em>easy to idle the whole days away. As James Clear <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits" target="_blank">has said</a>, "our real motivation is to be lazy and to do what is convenient". It's only understandable then that it takes too much effort to break this built-up inertia of not doing anything. Time, then, is spent generously lazying around, scoring easy joys.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The thought also reminds of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://getpocket.com/explore/item/a-lazy-person-s-guide-to-happiness" target="_blank">this exchange</a> between Dan Buettner and James Hamblin during one of their interviews.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Buettner</strong>: In the long-term view, you’re better off buying experiences than some new gadget. Buying things does produce some spike in joy or appreciation, but that wears off over time. A good experience actually gains luster.</p><p><strong>Hamblin</strong>: Despite knowing that, when I actually go to spend money on traveling or even just tickets to something, I think about how soon that will be over and gone. And if I buy a couch, I have it for years.</p><p><strong>Buettner</strong>: But the joy from the couch wears out. You’ll still flop down on it, but it won’t provide that bump of joy.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With time as the most valuable currency, what is, then, the parallel in real life to the "gadget", the thing that time can buy? Is it the worthless, hollow hours that one spends on streaming the same, old movies or TV shows? Or is that an experience?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What Buettner refers to as joy when talking about the product vs experience discourse, is satisfaction when moved over to real life. We should judge if the activity is an experience by the longevity of the satisfaction it brings. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There's no doubt that a whole day of movie marathon can lend momentary joy. But does it do that without being a burden on your mind? If so, then it is an experience. Else you have just carelessly wasted the most valuable currency for owning a thing and it will soon stop giving you joy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What are other examples of such <em>experiences</em> that time can buy?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Another <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/amitgawande/issues/this-that-and-a-lot-on-punctuation-264123">issue of Slanting Nib &amp; A Keyboard newsletter</a> is out today. It features essays that provide a brief history of how punctuation evolved, its significance, some valuable tips and witty guidelines on using the marks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week's issue also introduces a slight twist in the featured author's section. With every issue going ahead, I will feature specific writing from the writer being featured instead of a broad collection of works from him. It can be a short story, a poem or an essay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, do give it a read online. If what you read interests you, <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/amitgawande">do subscribe</a>. If it doesn't interest you, do let me know what doesn't work for you. I would love to hear it all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have published 5 issues of the newsletter and I have set the tone for the newsletter now. Setting the tone was the next mini-milestone for me. The newsletter has already been featured by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://inboxreads.co/n/slanting-nib-keyboard" target="_blank">Inbox Reads</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thanksforsubscribing.app/newsletter/slanting-nib-and-a-keyboard" target="_blank">Thanks for Subscribing</a> and I couldn't have asked for more. Now, I wish to continue the journey and focus on how I can interest more people to subscribe. Your feedback will, for sure, help.</p>

<p>Is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20%25_Project" target="_blank">20 percent project</a> still followed at Google? One where every employee is recommended to spend 80% on the official job and 20% on the project of their choice? I wonder because every time we hear about the success of this particular experiment at Google, we hear about the same old handful of products. Mainly AdWords and Gmail. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Have there been no other successful products from this experiment? If yes, why don't we hear more about them? If no, what has changed at the company? Has it grown too large to back small, hobby-like products? Is the environment not conducive for the small, hacky projects?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Marissa Mayer <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/google-20-percent-time-policy-2015-4" target="_blank">had famously quipped</a> regarding the project, "I’ve got to tell you the dirty little secret of Google’s 20% time. It’s really 120% time". </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe as the companies grow, the employees lose the sense of closeness, the sense of attachment they felt earlier. The sort of dedication that Mayer referred to just can't be expected from an aloof employee.</p>

<p>I'm consciously slowing myself down recently while doing everything . I've spent too much time worrying about the small things, planning about things too far in future. I've realised I'm not living in the moment. That's not healthy. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, I'm taking time doing my regular day to day activities. Slow down. Take a pause. Be cognizant of the task am doing. Be present, doing it. Not think about 10 other things that I might have to do later in the day. That doesn't help. Keep things simple.</p>

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Fed up of the western idea of self-empowerment where you have to become a better you, discover your inner billionaire, get beach bodied, work, upgrade.

<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I can't agree more with Matt. I have decided to not be too harsh on myself. It's ok to not be "efficient" every time Not every activity needs to be done effectively. Or in the most time-effective way. Putting undue pressure on myself to plan things, multiple ones, so they can be grouped together. Nope, I am not ok to put myself through that anymore. All it does is adds to the already tall <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amitgawande.com/micro-stresses-burn-you-out/" target="_blank">list of micro-stresses</a>. Anyway, it's not as if I've too much work, too little time at hand. </p>

<p>I have unsubscribed from most (all?) of the daily newsletters about news. I am already bombarded with news that's mostly about world's burning. I do not want even my inbox to welcome me all the crazy updates from the world, but especially US. Most newsletters cover that and it's the same news repeated in all. Same essays, editorials from same sources. The Atlantic. NYTimes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had already done a similar exercise with tech newsletters. And podcasts. Again, it's same stories that I have already seen someplace else. Why read them again in the inbox? It just fills my newsletter to-read list. </p>

<p>I want to feel relaxed, open to read some meaningful words. Some essays that mean, matter for those who wrote them. Not a quick rewrite of what's already been told zillion times.</p>

<p>I know the burn out caused by the micro-stresses. It is pretty common especially with enterprise roles. However when you look at the possible relationships that can lead to such frictions, it is only natural that the causes can be, many a times, way closer to home.</p>

<p>Raghav woke up from his deep slumber; he wasn’t prone to these breaks in his sleep as long as there wasn’t a reason for that. He felt he heard a constant buzzing sound; he wasn’t hearing any now. He attempted to gain his full senses. He looked at the dimmed screen of his iPhone; it hadn’t woken him up as there were no new notifications. He wasn’t fully awake yet as he could hardly see anything around through his dizzy eyes. He attempted to see the time again on his iPhone; the screen read 03:28. He didn’t feel thirsty nor did he want to take a leak. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He got up and tottered along the floor to the bathroom. "<em>I am awake anyway, might as well go visit the bathroom</em>". He got back to the still, dark room. The clock on the wall read 03:30 now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just as he fell flat facedown on the bed, the sound hit him again. He could clearly hear the steady, deep buzzing noise that had woken him; he was absolutely certain it wasn’t coming from something in his room. He got up, this time fully awake, wide-eyed. He was convinced it was a sound he had heard before, a rattle of sorts on a wooden top. He got out of his bedroom; he was certain now that the sound was coming from downstairs. He tried to calm his mind, suspecting it was his loneliness that was playing games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Raghav stepped onto the first stair and the sound stopped with the first creak of the wooden stairs below his feet. The lack of sound now made him even more nervous. Did he make someone or <em>something </em>aware of his presence? Why did the sound stop? The lack of persistent hum was making his legs shake. He stood frozen on the stairs peering into the darkness beneath. It was lifeless, as it should be. But even the normal made Raghav quiver. He felt that the narrow staircase was closing in on him on both sides, becoming narrower with each second that he stood there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"<em>I cannot stand witless here anymore,</em>" he thought. He flicked at the switch panel. The light hadn’t even filled the staircase yet and the heavy hum filled the empty soundless surrounding again. He was sure now that his mind wasn’t playing any games with him; there was something rattling on the dining table in the kitchen. He took a deep breath and ran down the staircase. He stood at the entrance of the kitchen and peeked inside. It was pitch dark inside, except for the dancing light from a buzzing mobile phone on the dining table. Raghav was relieved it wasn’t an unexplainable sound. But the relief was only short-lived as the realization that the phone wasn’t his soon hit him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ambled slowly towards the shuddering device; the screen visibly showed that there was an incoming call. Before he could see whom the call was from, the phone stopped ringing and fright struck him as the room went dark around him. He scuttled across the floor to the dining table, picked up the phone, and brought the screen back to life. He heaved a sigh as the faint light illuminated his surroundings. He hadn’t even exhaled the full sigh yet before the phone in his hand started to vibrate again. He slowly turned the now-brightened screen to face him; his face went white. The screen read <em>Incoming call . . . Raghav iPhone</em>.</p>

<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/amitgawande/issues/on-notebooks-words-language-260801" target="_blank">third issue of Slanting Nib &amp; A Keyboard</a> newsletter is out today. It features thoughts from a few brilliant minds on what makes writing natural. Be it in a notebook to be relished privately. Or be it published to be critiqued openly. Again, am pretty satisfied with how even this issue has come out. The featured writings are inspiring for me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These past few weeks have been a great learning experience. When I had started planning for this newsletter around a month back, I gave myself a small target - publish 3 issues. Don't think about subscribers. Don't think about the future or the tone or the structure. Just make sure 3 issues are consistently delivered over 3 weeks and what is included in every issue excites <em>me</em>. I feel I have managed that. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the first checkpoint reached, I don't intend to stop yet. I want to continue towards the next goal - set the tone. </p>

<p>One of my dad's closest friend passed away today. Understandably, my dad was very sombre for the whole day. He told me he had spoken to his friend just yesterday when he was all fine. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just last week, my aunt too had lost her father. She also told me she had spoken to her dad just a day before and even he was all fine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They both died due to heart failure. They both shared one more truth, though. They both already had a weak heart and both said that all the news around COVID and the resultant lockdown were making them lonelier. They felt burdened -- even though they had their close family and friends always around them for support.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will we also add these deaths to the this pandemic's toll? Because, of course, these aren't isolated cases. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/health/coronavirus-mental-health-anxiety.html" target="_blank">psychological fallout</a> is far-reaching than immediately noticeable symptoms. </p>

<p>I have finally made my mind. I am not going to pay for HEY. It is a wonderful service, no doubt. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amitgawande.com/hey-has-me-conflicted/" target="_blank">I love it. I just don't need it.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have been using HEY for almost two weeks now and since last few days, I have hardly acted on any emails the way the team wants me to. Most emails have been filtered out. Tells me an email as a communication medium is already pretty worthless for me.  I can't pay so much for something that's worth so little. Here's my state from yesterday as I <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://micro.blog/amit/9882520" target="_blank">responded to</a> an ongoing conversation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>HEY makes my email even more worthless than it already is for me. I hardly see any emails getting filtered through to me. I'm yet to decide if it's a good thing or a bad one.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have always been a user of the <em>free</em> Gmail service until now. I have evaluated many email services over the years, but haven't paid for any. I do not run my livelihood over my personal email. Neither do I receive so many emails that managing them becomes a hassle of any sort. I could just sit down for a few minutes and handle all of them together. I hardly have to triage them -- snooze or reply later are all nice features. But I rarely need them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If all the other emails services failed to pique any interest in me earlier, why did HEY even come so close? Well, because I do see how all the features they tout as game-changing can actually solve the problems many people face with their email. No wonder then that even I want to use all the features. But my current lifestyle just doesn't have any need for any of those.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>But the screening and the feed and the paper trail?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, I spent the last couple of hours on Gmail to clean my filters -- and with that, I have now got a pretty similar workflow in place with the help of filters and customized priority inbox. Here's how my inbox looks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:image {"id":6089,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2020/f404136a66.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6089"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will I be able to maintain it? No idea. I have managed to sail through for so long. I had no clue about the sheer amount of emails even my current system was already "screening" out. So, I believe I would be fine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Won't I love if a system did that for me? Well, sure I would love that. But you see Hey <em>doesn't</em> want to be that system. Here's <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hey.com/the-hey-way/" target="_blank">an excerpt from their manifesto</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Email’s better with a human at the helm. That’s you. You’re better at deciding where things go, what your intentions are, and how you want things set up. The machines have a lot of learning to do before they'll be able to second-guess whether you actually wanted to see that email, whether it was a receipt or a newsletter, and even what you should be writing someone. At HEY, it's human intelligence over artificial intelligence.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The whole workflow in HEY begins with me screening the first time senders before they arrive at my inbox. Well, nice. However, am ok to take the same decision after it has reached my inbox -- I will create a filter. That's ugly, manual work sure. But <em>it doesn't cost me $99/year worth of my time</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have already created labels for feeds and paper trail. And many more. Because you see, my emails don't just fit in these two categories. I have a lot many more filters. And I have pretty simple rules for each.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>I need this mail in my inbox, unread.</li><li>I need this to skip my inbox, but stay unread. I will get to it.</li><li>I need this to skip my inbox and get marked as read.</li><li>I need this to be deleted.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's it. All my filters do just this. I will continue to do so manually. (I do wish though that the Gmail's Android app allowed creating simple filters in their app.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>And am ok to lose the email address I want?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, I've currently shared my Gmail address everywhere. Even if I shift to HEY, I have to change the email address registered with many of the services. I think if I am ever to go through all this trouble, it would be for one with my custom domain. In which case, it won't matter what email address I get <em>on the service</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All in all, HEY is a brilliant service with a fresh perspective towards the way we use our emails. It can potentially enliven the email offerings from all the players, just the away Gmail did back in 2004. But I don't face the problem it is trying to solve; I have no use for all its groundbreaking features. So, I can in no way justify paying the price it asks for it.</p>

<p>I just watched Hamilton and am left breathless -- what an experience this was. I'm so glad that Disney decided to release it digitally worldwide so that the people world over can witness the extravaganza. There were so many moments when I was singing and swaying along or sitting stunned in my seat mesmerized. No doubt, the live experience would be many-fold grander. But there's no chance in hell I would get to see this show live ever. At least, I can appreciate now why it is praised so much by anyone who has been lucky to experience this live. </p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What else could I do?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, there is so much more that I <em>could</em> do. I do not openly express my anguish looking at the adverse situation the impoverished lots are going through. I do not stand for the rights of minorities world around as much as I should. Or contribute towards changing the clearly imbalanced societal status quo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or speak up openly when I see a gender bias in play. I haven't yet told that one guy to not keep saying "guys" in a meeting with many of my female colleagues. It is wrong. I cringe every time. But I could also <em>speak up</em>.</p>

<p>Yesterday I managed to get all my subscriptions into a single place to check how much I was spending on services. Boy, I was in for a shock. My subscription for media services has grown two-fold. Lockdown is, of course, a cause. So, I will let it float around till normalcy returns outside.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I always had my media and productivity services balanced, of course, it was never intentional. But I guess the addition of a HEY subscription <em>might </em>bring things again in balance. I still have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amitgawande.com/hey-has-me-conflicted/" target="_blank">5 days to decide</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Speaking of tracking subscriptions, I used an app called Bobby while I was on iOS and I sorely missed it since I shifted to Android. However, I've found a brilliant app called (of course) <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.simolation.subscriptionmanager&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Subscriptions</a>. The app has one job and it does perfectly.</p>

<p>I paused at that last word in the title. I was so close to writing "hooked". But then I thought have they really sold the promise yet? No doubt, they are close. But, it's not a done deal yet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why is this service so enticing though? I mean it's just an email service. I <a href="https://micro.blog/amit/9837640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don't even use the email</a> that much. So why do I keep going back to HEY? It has got something to do with their promise. Of making me care even less for the email.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every now and then I visit the "Screened Out" section to see all the mails I would have seen had I been using any other email app. And it is a mess in there. These emails never get filtered out with my existed setup. I am tired of setting all the filters in Gmail. It just doesn't work efficiently. Junk emails always end up reaching my inbox.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This hasn't been the case with HEY. Because they have decided on a sane default - everything screened out if not allowed earlier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We ask every software to side with "opt-in" for every marginal aspect -- something that would split their users on whether they accept it or not. Why can't expect the same from our email service too?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And I haven't even gotten used to all the other features that I think are potential game-changers that <a href="https://www.copingmechanism.com/2020/using-hey-for-email/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many others</a> <a href="https://sangsara.net/2020/06/26/hold-up-hey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have well documented</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>I have merged and renamed the threads -- I like the cleaner workflow.</li><li>I have set aside the emails and marked them to be handled later. I like the idea. </li><li>I do not like the feed; in its current form, it is almost useless. Is it just there so that I can skim through and ignore?</li><li>I like the paper trail section. I don't want to see those emails, but want them handy.</li><li>I <em>love</em> sticky notes and notes that we can put on emails. Such a simple, but brilliant idea.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, with all said, I <em>am</em> conflicted. Do I want the clean experience so bad that <em>I am willing to pay the cost</em>? Do the junk email that I have got into the habit of deleting without a second thought bother me so much that <em>I am willing to pay the cost</em>? Can't I just manually screen-out the emails?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have about a week to decide.</p>

<p>Finally, I have completed a pretty tricky exercise that I <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amitgawande.com/1592274412383-2/" target="_blank">had started</a> about a couple of weeks back. It wasn't tricky because I wanted to move my website to a different platform. It was tricky because I wanted to do it <em>cleanly</em>. I wanted to retain as many things that worked well for me as I could. I didn't want to break much that was core.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, after days of experiments and trial runs, and notes and list of reviewed <em>to-dos</em>, I've managed to switch to WordPress. I will note down why someday - one short, but big reason though is editing. I am tired of working custom solutions with Blot -- it's a great service, no doubt. But you need to love your files <em>a lot</em>. I am currently not in that phase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, as intended, the core is retained. The links are (hopefully 🤞) not broken. <a href="https://amitgawande.com/tagged/indieweb">#IndieWeb</a> support was a must, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/am1t/wp-musings" target="_blank">have stitched that in.</a> The option to switch to a dark theme was a must. A simple reading experience was a must. I've managed to get good writing experience too. So, times now to sit back and relax.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do let me know if see anything that's not working well. I won't mind if you also let me know if everything's working fine.</p>

<p>I find it extremely interesting that I have most things going for it now. I do not know what's even missing. Why can't I just make this my new home? Sure if can't be bad, right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's look at the pros and cons. Rather this is a thought dump of sorts. No pros and cons, just some quick thoughts to compare experiences. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>My existing setup is a terrible writing experience. Every time I had to think where to post from. It is so terrible for instant posts. Not with the new setup. </li><li>With WordPress, I can post from which ever place that works now. I don't have to think to much about writing. Only focus on thought. Good for fixing too. Get things out and forget. </li><li>Theming is so easy with WordPress. No more struggling with files. </li><li>That reminds me. I am tired of working with files. Blot is good with files. But it wants to play with files. Not provide metadata as such. I provide metadata everytime. It defeats the purpose of the simplicity of Blot. Why mess around the frontmatter? I am tired of working that way. I want editor. Write and forget. </li><li>With WordPress though, I lose control and gain <em>headache of managing instances</em> again. Am I ok to sign up for that again? Can I trust myself with it? May be I need to. Let's give it a go. </li><li>Markdown is good but not always. Sometimes it is easier to work with WYSIWYG editors. Just write and forget. Sure markdown is more supported. It is again good when working in files. Not otherwise. Did I say am tired of files?</li></ul>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2020/9cb9eb4dad.jpg" alt="Pixar Animation Studios"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vox Media has <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/6/27/18715845/pixar-movies-rankings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an updating list</a> of all the Pixar movies, ranked by their Culture team from worst to best. They have been doing this since last year. So it is interesting to see the list updated with every Pixar release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Since the release of its very first feature film, <em>Toy Story</em>, in 1995, Pixar has become one of Hollywood’s most celebrated animation studios. Ranging from superhero adventures to tales of a lonely robot on a post-apocalyptic Earth, the studio’s 22 movies to date have earned plaudits for being artistically adventurous and telling stories ostensibly aimed at kids that have just as many adult fans.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yep, absolutely. I whole-heartedly agree. I and my family <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/1591546306141">had recently watched Onward</a> and had thoroughly enjoyed it. So when Vox says lets <span class="pull-double">”</span> take a look back at the high highs and low-ish lows of the acclaimed animation studio”, even I want to attempt that. I do not agree with Vox Culture team’s ranking. So I want to put my own rankings out there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><b>*</b> <i>Nope, not gonna do that.</i> I can’t rank all of them. <i>There are 22</i> — how can you ever say if The Bug’s Life is worse than Cars 2. So, I will just give out my top ten; this is not a commentary in any sense. I am not a film critic. I can’t explain why one is artistically better than the other. What I can say is why I like, nah, <i>love</i> each movie in here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><b>10. Cars (2006)</b></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As far as I can recall, this was one of the early movies I saw from the Pixar studio and I was left completely mesmerized. It was also the first time I realized how emotional an animated movie can leave you. The story was wonderful, made me emotional at many moments. And it wove the same magic for my daughter. So this remains a special movie, to this day; doesn’t matter if it is actually a good movie or not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>9. Onward (2020)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We watched the one the most recently as we were stuck at home for more than 3 months. And the fun we had as a family throughout was completely unforgettable. It made us laugh, made us cry and at times even terrified. It made us forget about all the terrible news that was spread through the world outside — makes it a very special movie for me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>8. Monsters Inc. (2001)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, another of the early movies from Pixar. I wasn’t a parent then, but it made me aware for the first time what parenting would be. As I watched Sulley and Mike struggle to keep Boo safe, at the same time growing closer to her, it made me worried and equally excited for the parent that I was one day going to be. I fell in love with Boo as she expressed myriad of expressions through her toddler face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>7. Inside Out (2015)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This has to be one of the smartest and most creative animated movies ever made. Such a creative story stitched into a brilliant movie. The colours, the characters, their journeys alone and together. How they drove the central human character was fascinating. This was again a movie that made me realize what I need not do around my daughter as she reaches adolescence one day. The story was clever, the execution was top-notch and the emotional attachment was to the point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>6. Wall-E (2008)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another clever movie from Pixar. The first half without any spoken words was absolutely brilliant. I still can’t fathom how the studio made us fall in love with a squarish droid. He doesn’t speak, he doesn’t have any human features. But he expressed so many emotions that many of the well-paid actors fail to do. Wall-E’s struggle to express his love for Eve had me root for this lovely droid throughout the movie. Wish humans didn’t arrive later in the movie to spoil what could have been the finest movie of all times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><b>5. Toy Story (1995)</b></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another movie that I watched way back in my teens when I had started to believe I had become too grown up to watch animated movies any more. Pixar prove me wrong — boy what a masterpiece this one is. A movie with a brilliant story that also teaches you so much. Still being so much fun at the same time. Toy Story completely defined the roadmap for future animated films — they had to cater to the kids and the adults with a kid within at the same time. This movie did it so perfectly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><b>4. Coco (2017)</b></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I love music. And I love getting emotional while watching a movie. Especially if it weaves stories around families. So Coco fit just the right spots for me. Boy, oh boy. Such a wonderful ride it was. Those mesmerizing colours. The peppy, moving music. The story that has you gripped throughout. Coco was an experience of a kind. Again, such a meaningful movie that teaches you the importance of a family. I had a tear rolling down my cheek during the final reunion song.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><b>3. Finding Nemo (2003)</b></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another film that touched my yet-to-be-a-parent’s heart. I was rooting for the worried, clown-fish dad throughout his transformation. And I can’t recall how many more times have I rooted for this guy since then. I watch this movie every now and then with my daughter. She loves it; she asks me many questions about what plays out in the movie. I pull her close to me into a hug and answer her to the best of my abilities. Knowing very well, that soon she too would want to explore more and I would have to stop being overprotective and let her do that. Anyway, see that’s what even thinking about this movie does to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Toy Story 3 (2010)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s just so much to love about this movie. The friendship, the bond that we’ve seen grow over the 3 movies, comes so close to a culmination here. Full of laughter. Full of life-lessons. Full of heartbreaks. This is one hell of a movie - not just an animated one. Period. As Woody looks at Andy walking away while sitting close to Bonny towards the end, am sobbing away with joy. There are so many plots here and each one betters the last. This one is a string of masterclass at film making, one after another.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Up (2009)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just with that masterful opening montage, this one enters my top ten list any day. I had a lump in my throat right at the beginning. The movie follows it up with weaving such a beautiful story about Carl and his relation with Russel and the many friends he makes over their journey to Paradise Falls. I loved each character in this movie. Russel. Kevin. Dug. Even Muntz for that matter. The movie had me empathize with this antagonist too before he goes all bat-shit crazy, that is. And of course, finally Carl. I loved Carl so much that I had one character based on him in my fictional short story series. Up will always remain a very special movie for me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Best Moments from other movies</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are of course many other movies from Pixar that didn’t make the list but have some brilliant scenes. When She Loved Me song from <b>Toy Story 2</b>. All the action sequence from <b>The Incredibles</b>. Speech on criticism and creativity in the finale from <b>Ratatouille</b>. These movies could very well have made the list, just for these scenes. But, for me, the others on the list are just very close. So these remain the honourable mentions.</p>

<p>It is a different sort of day today. Things are very different. I mean what's with the lonliness within? It needn't be this way, but this can't be helped I guess. Anyway. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am also very much reconsider the way I publish. Am back to thinking the "no-editor" interface is blot is not something I really find attractive at times. Everything is good. But a lack of a nice interface to write and publish does make me look out for alternatives. And WordPress always comes first - mainly due to the web app. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also looked at Ghost again. This line in its comparison to WordPress left be curios. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If you're looking for a platform that increasingly attempts to do everything and don't mind cutting through the noise to make it work for your publishing needs, then WordPress might be suitable for you.</p><cite>- Ghost vs WordPress </cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is that a positive or negative? Plus according to Ghost, WordPress costs "average managed hosting starts at $115/mo". That sounds too high. Don't WordPress plans start from $5/mo?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, I will continue to explore stuff. Time for change again, maybe?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another benefit is edit-on-the-go. Fixing issues with post is so much simpler with WordPress. Not with anything else. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The edit on the go is especially more powerful on desktop! I mean it opens up the editor and you can just add the text. It indeed is very powerful option. The editor is one reason I want to really consider WordPress -- <em>even if I have to pay for it</em>. I haven't finalized it yet though. The biggest deterrent for me is <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/1592274412383">the lack of easy way to add IndieWeb support</a>. I am yet sure if I can live without these -- mainly webmentions and syndication.</p>

			 <p>I have decided to actively be back <a href="https://twitter.com/_am1t" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Twitter</a> again. In a way, I never was off Twitter; I have been a passive contributor on Twitter for more than a year now. During that time, <a href="https://micro.blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micro.blog</a> became the place that I was most active at. However, recently I have found that the platform just doesn&#x2019;t attract me. It has got nothing to do with the product or the community there. Both remain brilliant. It is the diversity (or the lack thereof) that just doesn&#x2019;t fit my lifestyle, my routine.</p> <p>My timeline is never active when I <em>am</em>. Even those who are active in my timezone do not share my interests and my culture. It is frustratingly difficult to become part of this wonderful community.</p> <p>I had casually pointed out this challenge during my interaction with <a href="https://monday.micro.blog/episode-amit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jean on Micro Monday</a>. I am afraid the things haven&#x2019;t improved much in the 18 months since. I have made many attempts to overcome this. I tried to inspire people that I know, that I am friends with to join the service. I built <a href="https://microthreads.herokuapp.com/micro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micro.Threads</a> to check on the conversations that I missed while I was absent. I even tried to change my routine to better fit in. It was this last attempt that made me cognizant of the limits I was going to to just be an active participant at the service.</p> <p>I know there are people from my timezone, of my interest that are very much active on the service. I am sure there would be a thread somewhere listing all such folks. But that thread cannot be discovered or be searched for. Those folks cannot be easily found. I have come to realize that neither of these is a challenge with Twitter. No doubt, Twitter has its own set of challenges. But, at least, I can participate as per <em>my routine</em>.</p> <p>Lack of diversity and discovery remains Micro.blog&#x2019;s Achilles heel. It&#x2019;s a wonderful community on there; it just isn&#x2019;t inclusive enough for me to fit in.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The Mystery of the Blue Train is a typical Poirot mystery, just not presented in her signature intriguing style. There are just too many shifts to the points of view of the supporting characters. The clues are perceivable, but they aren&#x2019;t backed by any information that is revealed earlier. There were many moments when I knew what was being narrated was important, was a clue to something. But I could just not put my finger on why that was so. The resolution towards the end too did not feel very natural; it felt rushed, forced.</p> <p>With the way the novel is structured, it felt as if Christie began writing this somewhere in the middle when Poirot is introduced, reached towards the end, and began to wonder how to tie the woven mystery up. All the side characters and their backstories were penned at that point and spread across the novel.</p> <p>As a whole, the story just didn&#x2019;t feel coherent. It wasn&#x2019;t boring; I don&#x2019;t think Christie can write a boring mystery. But it just wasn&#x2019;t one of her finest works. I have heard even she has acknowledged this fact.</p>

If you point at the apps and shout<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>privacy killer&#x201D;, you are no better than the population that is protesting armed, asking for their freedom back.</p> <p>Understand that these aren&#x2019;t normal times.

			 <p>I received a call from my daughter&#x2019;s school today, enquiring if all was well with her online schooling. I was left completely clueless on how to respond to that.</p> <p>My daughter&#x2019;s school has enabled schooling of 5 subjects via an app. Each week, the app presents a new set of chapters, worksheets, quizzes across all 5 subjects. Besides, each week there are video conference sessions with teachers to recap what was learned in the last week.</p> <p>Sorry to report, but just two weeks in, this process already seems overwhelming. It is especially so given both me and my wife are working from home.</p> <p>I knew we weren&#x2019;t alone. <span class="small-caps">AP</span> <a href="https://apnews.com/a3e86445d1387ecd8d1df8f9f7743e1f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published a brilliant article</a> on how parents in the <span class="small-caps">US</span> are already getting burned through this distance learning&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;something that is especially tricky with young kids. And they are forced to make a very difficult choice.</p> <blockquote> <p>Amid the barrage of learning apps, video meet-ups and e-mailed assignments that pass as pandemic home school, some frustrated and exhausted parents are choosing to disconnect entirely for the rest of the academic year. Others are cramming all their children&#x2019;s school work into the weekend or taking days off work to help their kids with a week&#x2019;s worth of assignments in one day.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is just not easy. Parents aren&#x2019;t trained to be good teachers. The technology was never given a chance to prove it can work independently for teaching. It was always an additive. Plus nothing, <em>nothing</em> can replace the in-person learning from the people who are trained throughout their lives to do that. The comment below from one of the parents is very, very apt.</p> <blockquote> <p>This is a very crude bandage we&#x2019;re putting on a very big wound. We&#x2019;re just doing the best we can. A video can&#x2019;t look at your child&#x2019;s face and see the confusion. A teacher can do that.</p> </blockquote>

			 <p>I watched a few episodes of the new Netflix miniseries <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt9359294/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hasmukh</a>. Only because there was Vir Das associated with it. But it was such a bore. Das didn&#x2019;t fit the character - he is too posh to pull off the role of a small-town guy. Plus as a comedian on-screen, he just isn&#x2019;t funny.</p>

			 <p>I realize that I have so much time at hand by not doing the activities that I always wanted to avoid. Like those long commutes. Or needless trips to shopping malls. Or attending those guests that I didn&#x2019;t want to.</p> <p>So much time at hand. So much that I could do, that I could create potentially. <em>Potentially</em>.</p> <p>However, I find that my mind wanders off. It can&#x2019;t concentrate for long. It can&#x2019;t be creative. I keep staring at the blank screen before I give up and reach out for something to read. I stare at those words that should mean something. But then I again give up. Finally and unwillingly, I land at <em>those</em> apps. The apps that I had carefully spent the last few months on getting into a habit of avoiding.</p> <p>Wish this wasn&#x2019;t difficult. But the fact is today everything is. Wish I could better control my mind. But the fact is today I can hardly control anything.</p> <p>When this all passes over, it is not this helplessness that I want to remember these days for. So it is my photo gallery that is most happening.</p> <p>It is full of snapshots of everything different that we have been doing <em>together as a family</em>. Cooking. Playing. Singing. Dancing. Not just the photos, it is full of videos now. I am creating movies out of these moments of togetherness. At least, am learning now. The pictures, the movies, they need not be perfect, as long as they bring out the underlying, momentary happiness, <em>hopefulness</em>, that I lived through.</p> <p>So some years down, when I get a notification for new memories in my photos app&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;saying<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>5 years ago&#x201D;&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;it is that feeling of togetherness, happiness, hopefulness that I want to personally associate this pandemic, this lockdown with.</p> <p>Maybe that&#x2019;s very selfish of me. But that&#x2019;s the least harmful vice this pandemic could live behind within me.</p>

			 <p>Some day, the world will be free of the effects of the current pandemic we are living. All would then switch to live a <em>normal</em> life again.

It is not that our brilliant scientist may not bring the treatment early. The challenge is to make it reach the millions of people affected by the virus. What that means, according to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/12/999117/blueprint-what-it-will-take-to-live-in-a-world-with-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this brilliant essay in <span class="small-caps">MIT</span> Technology Review</a>,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>we have to prepare for a world in which there is no cure and no vaccine for a long time&#x201D;.</p> <blockquote> <p>There is a way to live in this world without staying permanently shut indoors. But it won&#x2019;t be a return to normal; this will be, for Westerners at any rate, a new normal, with new rules of behavior and social organization, some of which will probably persist long after the crisis has ended.<br /> <br /> In recent weeks a consensus has started to build among various groups of experts on what this new normal might look like.</p> </blockquote>

			 <p>Empty, lifeless streets. Calm, soundless surrounding. Few overly protected bodies strolling around.</p> <p>No cars. No motorbikes. No home delivery agents. <em>No horns</em>. No flights zooming through the skies.</p> <p>Waking up early, trying to get into some sort of routine. As my mind attempts to convince me that it just doesn&#x2019;t matter when I wake up. A morning tea with family, the ears listening to and the brain doing it&#x2019;s best to ignore the updates from the news.</p> <p>I know very well that there&#x2019;s not going to be any significant change to the state of the world. I am mindful that I can&#x2019;t expect the things to be back to any form of normalcy anytime soon. But I still have ears to the news - in search of that one downward trend.</p> <p>Or that one act of human kindness that will bring a smile to my face.</p> <p>Yoga at home. A half an hour walk across the rooms. And balconies. At home. Work, as the mind wanders every now and then. At home. Play board games, silly pranks with my daughter. Dance. Be foolish. At times play some outdoor games too. But just inside. At home.</p> <p>Spend evenings with family. Look outside to the empty streets, the calm surrounding. At those few strolling bodies.</p> <p>Hopeful that I will soon be able to go out. Not being afraid. Or circumspect. Not alone. But being carefree. With family. Take that impulsive walk or a ride. Go for that long drive.</p> <p>Hopeful that it won&#x2019;t be so eerily quiet outside. And inside. At the same time, thankful that I&#x2019;ve my family close to me to lean on to. To gain strength from.</p> <p>Today marks 14 days that we have spent locked down in your homes. The at-home routine has become our new normal now. I am getting used to it.</p> <p>I spent the evening today with my daughter, looking out to the clear skies. She asked me nonchalantly why can&#x2019;t we go outside. And before I could answer, I saw her roll her eyes and blurt without a hint of sadness in her voice,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span><em>yeah, the virus&#x201D;</em>.</p> <p>She wished it will go settle onto the hilly forests that are visible from our balcony. She wished us, <em>just our family</em>, got fairy wings. So that we could make the clear, empty skies our home. The purity, the genuineness in her wishes, her thoughts brought a smile to my face.</p> <p>I know it is this zeal in her that will help me pull through this exhausting time. This new normal is fine with me.</p>

			 <p>I have been working with David Merfield on a little side project. The idea started simple - what if there was a simple posting interface for <a href="https://blot.im/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blot</a>? In extension, something that one can use to write and publish a post to Dropbox. Blot is simple as-is for writing and posting (<em>it&#x2019;s all files</em>). But there are times when I do want to quickly post from my web browser. And for such times, I still need a simple writing interface.</p> <p>That thought was enough to interest both me and David. We got to work. The project got neglected in between. And then was picked up again. And I think, it is in a state now where it can really be useful to a few. I can attest to that because I, myself, have been using it for <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/1585247849573">few days now</a>.</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s <a href="https://wall.blot.im/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall</a>&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;a<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>web-accessible text-editor over Dropbox, <em>works nicely with Blot</em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span>.</p> <p>I believe this would be useful for many. It is <em>clean</em>. It is <em>light, pure-client side</em> application. It supports <strong>local drafts</strong>. It can <strong>export markdown</strong>. It can <strong>publish to Blot</strong>. Perfect for all those text posts.</p> <p>I have <a href="https://github.com/am1t/scribe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my own fork</a> of the project where I want to use the editor and support publishing to multiple places. To start with, I have extended it to post it anywhere in Dropbox.</p> <p>I have hosted it <a href="https://scribe.itchs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here as Scribe</a>. I plan to extend it next to be used as a micropub client. Still in works, though.</p> <p>Of course, this is not perfect yet. For one, it does not work well on smaller screens. But it is a good enough. Do give it try.</p>

			 <p>In today&#x2019;s time of confusion and uncertainty, safety of the food, our essential need, is equally important. Serious eats has a brilliant essay on just this topic. I think the writer or me are not alone who are troubled with all these concerns, and the essay is must read in that regard.</p> <blockquote> <p>Even so, plenty of folks&#x2014;myself included&#x2014;have been confused or curious about the safety of allowing restaurants to continue preparing and serving food. Is it actually safe? Should I reheat the food when I get it home? Is it better to support local businesses by ordering food, or am I only putting workers and delivery people at risk? And if I&#x2019;m cooking my own food, what guidelines should I follow?</p> </blockquote>

			 <p>I feel too stressed out these days. It is not from the pressure of work. Or from the fear of getting infected by Coronavirus. But from the factors that I have no control over.</p> <p>How people I do not know just refuse to behave in the larger interest of the community. Or how media ignores being responsible in covering the biggest tragedy the world is facing in a long time.</p> <p>Or how few people are taking the pandemic too lightly. So much so that they are putting the lives of many at risk, even their near and dear ones. Or how few people are taking the same pandemic way too seriously. So much so that they have simply stopped living. Obsessing non-stop over the negativity and gloominess all around.</p> <p>Where do I fall? I realized today that the inner turmoil has started to affect the way I behave. The way I express. The way I carry myself. I better find a solution, a distraction. Soon.</p>

			 <p>Ruth Marcus <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/20/pallid-version-normalcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has written a wonderful opinion piece</a> at The Washington Post on how this latest global tragedy, the pandemic feels a lot more life-altering. Social distancing enforced by the ways the Coronavirus spreads has affected us a lot deeper than what we initially thought.</p> <blockquote> <p>How much the virus has reminded us of the mundane pleasures we take for granted &#x2014; walking down the well-stocked shelves of our local supermarkets, chatting idly with our co-workers; kissing a friend on the cheek when we meet for lunch. Oh, to hug again without having to calculate the inherent risk: My mother? My daughters?<br /> <br /> When I venture out to walk the dog, there is a grim camaraderie with those we encounter. The dogs, heedless of contagion, sniff away, and while their humans maintain a sober distance, even strangers inquire after one another&#x2019;s well-being. In the barren aisles of the market, at least the last time I risked a visit, there was an air more of solidarity than panic</p> </blockquote> <p>So true. What we thought was normal is dreaded now. And it the normalcy that we yearn for now. Together as a society.</p>

			 <p>To say that the situation is not that bad yet, that it&#x2019;s not scary, is a bit irresponsible at this point.

Either due to lack of resources or willingness.</p> <p>Willingness to be informed is necessary and is something that is often ignored. Many people just aren&#x2019;t willing to accept the fact that the situation is dire.

Those saying we need to follow such extreme precautions are conveniently ignored. It is important that these minds are kept informed. Enlightened.</p>

However, I think there&#x2019;s just no easy way to redirect people to write a response if that is the only option available.</p> <p>To provide with such an option and at the same time not make it extremely easy for someone to spam the space, I am enabling GitHub issues based commenting system of <a href="https://utteranc.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>utterances</em></a>. It&#x2019;s lightweight, needs a valid account and I believe sits well with the readers that are not already on micro.blog.</p> <p>I will keep this on for some time. It sits well with my current setup, doesn&#x2019;t look out of place. I may rethink again sometime in future. For now, this commenting system stays on.</p>

			 <p>This social distancing exercise takes a toll on one&#x2019;s mind, it is not very easy to undergo. When we go outside and meet others, be social that is, we let our mind wander from the day to day grind. It doesn&#x2019;t matter then if the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>social gathering&#x201D; is as regular as just at the office. People around have stories that they are keen to share.</p> <p>We chat, discuss, debate, tease, prank, laugh. We brainstorm, we learn from others, we teach others. We do this all together as a group. Everything kind of stops when the group is no longer present in-person. Video and audio conferencing feel too formal.</p> <p>This all can&#x2019;t be healthy - it is sure to have some psychological effect. Melissa Pandika <a href="https://www.mic.com/p/the-emotional-toll-of-social-distancing-22610830" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes on Mic</a> about the emotional toll such social distancing precautions can take.</p> <blockquote> <p>Right now, even the simplest, purest of human gestures, the ones we crave most in times like these &#x2014; a hug or squeeze of our hand, reassuring us everything will turn out okay &#x2014; now carry risk.</p> </blockquote> <p>So true. There are already reports of how this is affecting families all around the world. I am afraid the chances are people will soon get fed-up, get impatient. They might stop caring about others, become isolated within. Become indifferent.</p> <p>Of course, another possibility is that this will bring immediate families even closer. I can do all that I do in a group while I am at home with family. I can decide not to isolate myself at home. I get focused hours for work and at the same time decide not to stay glued to the laptop throughout the day while working. Take the breaks that I usually take and spend that time with my family.</p> <p>There is no need to wind the working day down with media consumption as I can relieve stress throughout the day when required. Look beyond the mobile, tablet and television screens. I can spend the hours I generally wasted on commutes on something productive.</p> <p>Share stories. Hear from loved ones. Play with my daughter. Talk, chat, discuss, debate, tease. Laugh. Do everything I do at the office. And more.</p> <p>I think I will give this possibility a chance. Distance, not isolate. May be, social distancing, physically distancing myself from the outside world, will bring me emotionally closer to my family.</p>

			 <p>Coronavirus has completely taken over all forms of media and the discussions around me. Not an hour goes by without a mention of <a href="https://nyti.ms/2IBApu0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the global pandemic</a>. It&#x2019;s not an all-out panic yet, but an increasing number of positive cases in my city has, for sure, put the people on alert.</p> <p>I am avoiding unverified information that gets spread on social media and group messaging platforms. But it is difficult to stay and keep others, sane amidst the deluge of news bites that get spewed across every few minutes. It becomes tedious and tiring to focus on facts and keep enlightening people around you about the same.</p> <p>It sure looks like a storm is brewing within all.&#xA0;I just wish that the uncertainty subsides before there are more cases of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia_and_racism_related_to_the_2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worst sides of humans on display</a>. If not, any hope for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/opinion/coronavirus-social-distancing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the social solidarity</a> that Kara Swisher, so succinctly, calls for will be lost.</p> <blockquote> <p>In addition to social distancing, societies have often drawn on another resource to survive disasters and pandemics: social solidarity, or the interdependence between individuals and across groups. This an essential tool for combating infectious diseases and other collective threats. Solidarity motivates us to promote public health, not just our own personal security. It keeps us from hoarding medicine, toughing out a cold in the workplace or sending a sick child to school. It compels us to let a ship of stranded people dock in our safe harbors, to knock on our older neighbor&#x2019;s door.</p> </blockquote>

			 <p>Is there anyone who can easily find the one emoji that they do not use very often? How many of the 1500+ emojis can one possibly use? There is a limited set of emojis I use regularly. And because they are front and centre every time I open an emoji keyboard, they tend to get used even more often.</p> <p>Even the way they get categorized is horrible. Which category do you think you will find a loudspeaker in? Objects, you say? What about a balloon? Now the answer to that might differ based on which platform you use. Android puts it under<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Activities&#x201D; while iOS puts it under Objects. Not just do the <a href="https://twistedsifter.com/2016/04/how-the-same-emoji-varies-across-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emojis vary across platforms</a>, even the simple thing like how to categorize them varies.</p> <p>I think the emojis need a better, simpler replacement. I do not think memoji is that - it calls for too much effort before one starts to use them. Maybe the whole emoji set needs a complete reset. Anyway, how many of the myriad face emojis can you correctly identify and use? Do you know how many we started with? Just two - a smiling face and a frowning face. Now that is manageable.</p>

			 <p>I have completed the consolidation exercise that I had <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/1583559643877">planned to</a> carry out this weekend. All the posts exist on the home page of the root domain now and is hosted by Blot. There are no sub-domains for separate posts. There is no landing page. It’s all words.</p> <p>Of course, I had butterflies in my stomach before I began the whole exercise. I had posts spread across different categories. I had very specific styling done for some rarely used components of the blog posts. And I had pages.</p> <p>Then I had some complex pages and posts. It was the thought of migrating this varied content that made me a bit edgy. Posts like this guide on <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/moving-from-squarespace-to-hugo">moving to Hugo</a>. Or this one about <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/display-webmentions/">displaying webmentions</a> along with posts. I had to manually migrate such posts along with the necessary styles.</p> <p>I am happy overall with what I have achieved. Things are simpler now. If I have to post something, I know where it would be. Doesn’t matter what the nature of the post is. This space now supports all types. Along with the <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/now"><code>/now</code></a> page reseted to begin from <em>now</em>.</p> <p>What this also means that I have to bear with few things. I have lost webmentions to the <code>blog</code> sub-domain posts. I have to reset my indieweb presence, clear all caches with indieauth sites. Thankfully, not much was broken that couldn’t be fixed simple re-logins and re-configurations. I (and <em>you</em>) have to bear with the configured redirects to propagate through the Internet and reach all. So the old links will stay unreachable till that happens.</p> <p>I have kept the Hugo site alive. It hosts <a href="https://archive.amitgawande.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the archive</a>, something I did not want to carry along. I just restyled it to make it resemble a timeline leading back into the time. I do not wish to ever post to it again. Simplicity of maintaining and updating my website with Blot has won me over.</p>

			 <p>I am going to consolidate all my online posts at single place. I currently have posts spread across Hugo and Blot. I want to simplify this&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;and am extremely comfortable currently with posting to Blot. So I will eventually migrate all my posts there and make that my main and the only web presence. It will also help me get rid of all the sub-domain mess that I currently have spewed across.</p> <p>This will, for sure, break a few stuff. But I am ok to live with that. I do not think I want to get into this mess ever again. All the posts need to stay in a single place. I do not want to divide them based on their types.</p> <p>I know the biggest problem in the whole plan is my curious mind. Next time a new platform comes around, am sure I will get on board and sign-up for another experiment. This time, I will try to not bring it onto my domain and let it stay offline.</p> <p>Anyway, no point thinking about the future. I know what I want to achieve now. And that&#x2019;s the goal for this weekend.</p>

			 <p>I recently <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2778882175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finished reading</a> Suspect by Robert Crais. I enjoyed this book, almost most of it. However it is, by no means, a great book.</p> <p>The story is too formulaic. The mystery is predictable. Most of the characters are not built well. Every plot<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>twist&#x201D; can be seen chapters ahead. Even the narration is too simplistic. It is linear with the problems introduced in a chapter and solved right in the next one. There is simply no tension.</p> <p>However, the overall book is a breezy read. No part gets boring. I especially liked the parts where it was just about Scott and Maggie, the German Shepherd. I usually do not enjoy the subplots involving pets. They are overdone most often, made too dramatic. That&#x2019;s not the case here. The bonding between them is developed really well. You care for both. And that&#x2019;s where lies the strength of the novel. I just wish it was backed by a nice crime mystery.</p>

			 <p>The decade gone by - 2010-2019 - was the most important decade of my life.</p> <p>This was the first full decade that I lived an <em>independent</em> life away from my parents - shaping my own life in a way. My personal life. And my professional life. I spent the decade before this one completing my education, setting things up for my life to come. But it was in this decade when I started recognizing myself. Defining myself.</p> <p>I got settled into my first job. I fell in love and then married her. We moved in into a house and made it our home. We learned to live together. We purchased our first car. We decided to settle in and shifted to a new town to do just that. We found a house where we felt we could start our independent life together and purchased it.</p> <p>We decided the time was right to welcome another member to our family. We were blessed with a baby girl, our little angel, and I fell in love again. She became our life. For the next years to come, every decision we took, <em>I</em> took was to make sure our daughter has the best life.</p> <p>I grew professionally. I proved my worth and gained respect amongst colleagues. And when that started dwindling towards the end of the decade, I decided it was time to move on to a new job. By this time, I was pretty clear what I wanted out of my carrier and thankfully I found a place and a role that could provide me with that.</p> <p>I identified my interests outside of work. And they have managed to provide me with the stability, the sanity in my lone times.</p> <p>As I look back at the years gone by, I can&#x2019;t help but think this was indeed <em>the</em> most important decade of my life.</p> <p>If there was one common theme that defined this decade for me was the decisions, the life-altering decisions I had to make throughout the past 10 years. The decisions that would make or break my life.</p> <p>And I think I have managed to come out unscathed. Bruised, scraped now and then, sure. But not marred. I feel satisfied with that.</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s me <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/10-year-challenge">looking inwards</a> at the start of the year on how the past 10 years have affected me.</p> <blockquote> <p>the fidgety teen from 10 years back has given way to the calmer, saner, thoughtful self of today. I feel content within and that is the most important thing.</p> </blockquote> <p>No doubt, today&#x2019;s is a changed, improved me over 10-years-younger myself. But if the decade gone by was defined by the <em>decisions</em>, I believe it would be the <em>balance</em> that defines the next decade - a balance between change and stability. Exciting times!</p>

I either access the video directly (if I know what I want to watch) or browse my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subscriptions page</a> (when I don&#x2019;t know what to watch). The home page is useless without history turned on. And so are other recommendations. Trust me, you do not want them.</p>

			 <p>The season finale of The Morning Show was brilliant. Extremely powerful, and so well performed. Not just the leads, but supporting cast too. And the use of opera was brilliant. Over 10 episodes, the makers have managed to make me connect with and care for all the key characters.</p>

			 <blockquote> <p>Spotify has one job: make a great music player. They execute. Their app has none of these problems. It&#x2019;s fast and bug-free. Spotify delights.</p> </blockquote> <p>Even I had recently switched to Spotify. I believed Apple always nails an experience - so they would even for music listening. At least, they would do a better job than other players. But I was wrong. Spotify is far ahead, especially with playlists and recommendations. They rarely get it wrong.</p> <p>As a side note, I always wonder why companies struggle while designing good music apps. It is such a simple use case, however most fail to get it right.</p>

			 <p>I started watching a couple more shows from Apple TV+, Servant and Dickinson. I have enjoyed whatever I have seen till now from both of them. 3 episodes in and I have no clue who is playing with whom in Servant. It is creepy as hell, but not disgusting. Dickinson is refreshing. A brilliant, unseen tale.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m pleased with the variety of shows that Apple has managed to serve in the first outing. The drama from The Morning Show. The fantasy world of See. And the scifi one of For All Mankind. And now a thriller and a comedy-drama too. Nice!</p>

			 <p>I did not realise releasing Twitter handles that are <em>not</em> in use for long would actually be an issue. I understand <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/27.html#a195807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Winer&#x2019;s point around link rot</a>. But that exactly is the reason why people should own personal spaces and share everything that matters to them only there.</p> <p>Also, while linking to something external, it preferably be a website. Because Twitter and others just rent us spaces for <em>our</em> thoughts on <em>their</em> platforms. It is too much to expect from theses businesses to not lend them ever to anyone else. Just own your space and let the lights on as long as you want.</p> <p>I am sure link rot is a problem that&#x2019;s not really very high on the list of issues that face these guys. Neither is the goal to be a better citizen of the larger web.</p>

			 <p>I have slowly started realizing that I still have a use for Twitter. There are some thoughts that are simply too micro or meaningless for them to exists as<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>posts&#x201D; on my blog. I feel what exists here on my blog somehow has my name associated with it. Lot more so than what exists on my Twitter profile - it does not have that burden.</p> <p>May be it is just me. May be I am overthiking this. But some posts (like a quick one line blurb) better exists on the fleeting Twitter timeline than on my website.</p> <p>This feeling of aloofness towards the service might exactly be the cause of all the problems with Twitter.</p>

I am not sure about that. But I want to make it as much difficult as am allowed.</p> <p>My recent switch to Android has already made this very difficult. Google signs itself up for too many permissions and starts collecting data from me, irrespective of whether I want it to or not. The least I can do is to remove that data as soon as possible. I am sure Google must already extract as much information about me as possible. After all, it is not about the raw data, but about the aggregations.</p> <p>So then do I have a problem with Google owning data about me or Google <em>knowing me</em>? In an ideal world I would avoid both. However, I do not think I can do the later (given my current usage pattern). I want to at least use the privacy controls that Google has made available to the fullest.</p> <p>I believe anyone who has a Google account should do this. It does not matter how often you use any of the myriad of Google services. Keep checking <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your Google activity</a> every so often and tweak those controls.</p>

			 <p>I recently read through a few of my journal entries from a month back. The experience was refreshing, that too with just a month that&#x2019;s been passed. It is the content, however, that I find extremely impressive. I had written so freely about everything. Not just the stuff happening with or around me. But thoughts, opinions, views about anything that I find interesting.</p> <p>As I read through them, I wondered if any of the stuff that I had written was so secret that I cannot share openly. There are some parts which I would not like to talk publicly about. But that is true about only a handful of entries. A majority could very well have been a blog post.</p> <p>Then why is it that I write a lot more freely in a journal? Is it because I believe no one will read it? And I subconsciously want others to read the blog posts? Maybe.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2019/10/23/074800.html">Logging out judiciously from social media</a></h1>

			 <p>I am on a journey <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/tagged/minimalism">to consciously reclaim focus</a> from the shambles of the distracting digital world. As part of the process, I have started actively following one more routine - I log out of every social media service once I have used it.</p> <p>I have, since long, not had any social media apps on my mobile device. This has helped me reduce the subconscious pick-ups of the device. At the same time, it was really easy to access the service in a browser. Especially because it is just one tap away in my favourites. That&#x2019;s as good as having an app on my device.</p> <p>To deter these, I now log out of every service from my browser once I have used it. So, every time I am tempted to access any of these services, an additional step of logging in is needed. There&#x2019;s also an added barrier of two-factor authentications for the services that support it. Cal Newport <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aptly captures</a> this sentiment of mine.</p> <blockquote> <p>By removing your ability to access social media at any moment, you reduce its ability to become a crutch deployed to distract you from bigger voids in your life.</p> </blockquote> <p>All and all, this one step alone of logging in every time is enough to fool my lazy mind to stay away from these<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>crutches&#x201D;. And hence not subconsciously spend any time on the services.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> I have already gotten rid of every social media platform I do not need (Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat). I am active only on Twitter and Micro.blog. To reiterate, my logout routine is applicable to every site that serves feed of some kind. Including email, feed readers, instant messaging platforms etc.</p> <p>Besides, I have started accessing these social services only at my desktop browser in Private mode (the Incognito mode in Firefox). So even if I forget to logout, it does not matter. Once the window is closed, all my session information is lost.</p> <p>I believe this change should also help me from a privacy perspective. The belief is the cookies from these data-hungry social media services would not follow me as I browse around the Internet.</p> <p>Can&#x2019;t they? Won&#x2019;t they? That&#x2019;s a whole different discussion. But overall am spending a lot less time absentmindedly scrolling these stupid feeds. I feel a lot less burdened thanks to that.</p>

Whitehat hackers at Germany&#x2019;s Security Research Labs developed eight apps&#x2014;four Alexa<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>skills&#x201D; and four Google Home<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>actions&#x201D;&#x2014;that all passed Amazon or Google security-vetting processes. The skills or actions posed as simple apps for checking horoscopes, with the exception of one, which masqueraded as a random-number generator. Behind the scenes, these<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>smart spies,&#x201D; as the researchers call them, surreptitiously eavesdropped on users and phished for their passwords.</p> </blockquote> <p>These horror stories of privacy violations on smart speakers are unending. There are just a few options here.</p> <ol type="1"> <li>Don&#x2019;t have anything, that has a mic or camera and is connected to the internet, around you.</li> <li>If that&#x2019;s too much for you, don&#x2019;t have any smart speakers in your home. Use your smartphone to connect to a good old Bluetooth speaker.</li> <li>If you do want a smart speaker around, learn you to use it cautiously. Switch it off when not needed. Use the mute option. Do not, <em>do not</em> install any third-party skill on the device. Let only Google and Amazon track you. At the very least, they can be held accountable.</li> </ol>

			 <p>Infinite scrolling sucks. I hate that more and more websites are implementing this terrible feature. It fails user-experience wise.

They have thought the experience through and designed the interfaces around that.</p> <p>I understand why publications want this to succeed. It leads to more page views, and hence possibly to more advertising revenue. But I was pretty surprised to see that even <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/17.html#a161833" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Winer felt the need</a> to support it on his <em>simple</em> blog. Completely unnecessary.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> Another aspect I did not think of initially was around accessibility. It must be an extreme nightmare. I think it is an issue even bandwidth wise. Especially on mobile devices. So in short, just don&#x2019;t implement this solution.</p>

They possibly want more creators on their platforms than passive consumers of the stream of photos. For them then, iPad is not a good device for taking pictures.</li> <li>According to them, Galaxy Fold is still a smartphone first with a first rate camera system. So, it deserves providing the first rate experience of using Instagram.</li> </ol> <p>Of course, how true this assumption is, is debatable.</p>

			 <p>Apparently, Google&#x2019;s face unlock on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50085630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixel 4 can allow access</a> to a user even if he has his eyes closed.

And the inbuilt biometric solutions are increasingly being depended on to validate that identity. So the OEMs can&#x2019;t afford a misstep with these solutions.</p> <p>I hope the smartphone makers realize they can&#x2019;t deal indifferently with the security of the devices.</p>

			 <p>It was exactly a year ago that I had posted an update on my then-recently undertaken <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/on-podcasts-news-well-being#no-news-experiment">no-news experiment</a>. It primarily involved -</p> <ul> <li>consuming news only through the morning newspaper</li> <li>no news related apps on my phone</li> <li>no notifications from social apps (including messages, WhatsApp)</li> </ul> <p>I am pleasantly surprised that the things begun then have more or less stayed the same. I still consume my news primarily from the morning newspaper. I still avoid visiting the news website. I still have the notifications from social apps disabled. For that matter, I have become more aggressive in disabling notification access to any app.</p> <p>The only deviation has been that I have installed a few news apps on my phone. I always had that urge to open some editorial on the browser when my mind was momentarily free. This minor change has quenched that.</p> <p>Of course, I am still extremely picky about which apps get installed. I have installed only a couple of news curating apps (also known for doing their job well). And The New York Times app.</p> <h1 id="digital-detox---no-youtube">Digital Detox - No YouTube</h1> <p>I have also recently undertaken a digital detox experiment. I want to check which additional service I can get off my routine. It should be something that I carelessly spend a lot of time on.</p> <p>I had recently been consuming a lot of stupid content on YouTube. I used to open the app every time I had some free time at hand. Or for that matter <em>even when I was busy</em> doing something else. It garnered a subconscious tap. Such absent-minded behaviour is never healthy.</p> <p>So I have planned to be off YouTube for at least a month to reset the terms of my relationship with this service. It has been 15 days now and I already feel better. I no longer have that urge to tap into YouTube any more. I have observed am following my routine a lot better.</p> <p>However, YouTube has become too important a destination for all kinds of videos. That includes videos relevant to my work too. So it is difficult to completely get rid of the access to the service.</p> <p>Of course, then, I plan to allow access to the app in a controlled manner. This time, however, I will set the terms again consciously. I am also planning to clear the YouTube view history before I do that. I believe this will help me reset the recommendations. I am, however, yet to decide the exact terms under which the service will be allowed back.</p> <p>During this month of digital detox, I also plan to indulge myself with some analogue activities that I had never done before. I have started doodling more. Sure, am not good at it. But I hit the web for inspiration and try to simply emulate.</p> <p>I am also spending dedicated time with my daughter without any digital devices around. It can be as less as 15 minutes. Involving simple talks. Or some silly games. But it has to be focused time.</p> <p>It is too early to see the effects of all this. One thing is for sure, though. I feel a tad less burdened on the inside.</p>

Get some space for yourself on the web - select any platform that lets you do so for free. Write anything. Or just share links and pictures.</p> <p>Don&#x2019;t look at numbers. Don&#x2019;t promote. Don&#x2019;t yearn for likes or replies. It is a chore that will hamper your interest. Get rid of such mindless distractions. Forget your blog exists if you want. It won&#x2019;t <em>feel</em> bad.

			 <p>Derek Sivers <a href="https://sivers.org/autom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently wrote</a> about how he does not prefer using automation for things that he would better do himself. Or he enjoys doing manually. According to Derek, the decision of whether one wants automation or not comes down to is this.</p> <blockquote> <p>how much of an expert you are at controlling this thing yourself, how much you still enjoy doing it, if you want the kind of assistance it provides</p> </blockquote> <p>I believe there is one more aspect that drives this decision for me - how convenient will the automation make my life after all? And what is the the cost associated with automating that?</p> <p>The price one pays might be in terms of the personal data he or she needs to relinquish. This is relevant primarily when the automation workflows are built and served ready-made by the companies. For example, as part of various functions of the smart assistants.</p> <p>It can also be in terms of the actual time one has to put in to build the overall automation workflow. This comes into picture when you are linking multiple applications and services to get a use-case handled. For example, while using Shortcuts or <span class="small-caps">IFTT</span>, Zapier and likes.</p> <p>In both the cases, whether I want the automation or not is a trade-off between the efficiency I gain due to the automation and the price I have to pay for that.</p>

			 <p>On a recent busy Friday morning, I hopped into my cab on my way to the office. I was about to isolate myself by plugging my ears with an audiobook. Right about that time, I heard a voice in Hindi, a local Indian language, giving directions to my Uber driver. It made me pause and ponder on how ubiquitous the technical solutions have become. A large section of society has learnt to start carrying these powerful devices along. And this change alone has made some complex businesses more accessible.</p> <p>Many, especially Apple, mock Android for being<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>a cesspool of cheap, sluggish devices&#x201D;. But it is Android that has put this change on the fast track. I spent my hour-long ride by being a lot more attentive than isolated. I decided to look around to the individuals, running small and medium businesses, using digital solutions. Almost everyone was flaunting some form of an Android device.</p> <p>Uber drivers for managing their rides and the routes. Small shop owners for accepting digital payments. Delivery-only restaurants for accepting orders. <a href="https://www.swiggy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Food delivery</a> agents running around on bikes to find the next order to be delivered. Part-time<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span><a href="https://www.urbanclap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">service experts</a><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span> on the look-out for their next housekeeping jobs. And many more individual or small group ventures.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the always-connected<a href="#footnote-1CZ8" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-1CZ8"><sup>1</sup></a> and accessible Android devices have enabled all these use cases. The two combined have also managed to pull millions of more people into the digital age. Sure, iOS might be the more secure, more private platform that&#x2019;s better for everyone. But it is <em>not</em> for everyone because it is not affordable to everyone.</p> <p>We need to credit Google for fostering a platform that attracts more and more OEMs. This makes the platform a lot more usable for the majority section of the world. And they continue to lessen the needs of the platform, recently with the introduction of the <a href="https://www.android.com/versions/go-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go edition</a>. No doubt, it suits and assists their business model. However, it doesn&#x2019;t matter. They do that so, in their own words,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>even the most affordable Android smartphones are as sweet as can be&#x201D;. I&#x2019;ve come to believe that. Kudos!</p> <p>Yes, let&#x2019;s make the technology affordable for more people so that they too can benefit from the new-age advances. And while we do that, let&#x2019;s also make the same affordable technology powerful. Because when we do that, we open more ways the people can earn, can learn, can connect, can be part of the world.</p> <section class="footnotes"> <hr /> <ol> <li id="footnote-1CZ8"><p>There is a parallel story of how a business tycoon <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3f1fe4d6-e4e0-11e7-a685-5634466a6915" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reshaped the Indian telecom market</a> with his launch of aggressively priced mobile data plans.<a href="#ref-1CZ8" class="footnote-back">&#x21A9;</a></p></li> </ol> </section>

			 <p>I recently went through an experience that put my rational mind under a scanner. After a tiring session of shopping for clothes, I stood in the queue to pay for the stuff that my family had <em>finally</em> decided to buy. I always hate the process of selecting clothes in the shopping malls - more so when my family&#x2019;s doing it than me. I just can&#x2019;t fathom the sheer number of parameters my wife, my daughter and my sister together can cobble up while deciding a piece of cloth to be selected (to be frank, rejected seems to be more apt). Anyway, it is a battle that I have lost many occasions over years - so moving on.</p> <p>The billing process that follows isn&#x2019;t painless either. I am always bombarded with so many questions.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Do you have membership? Why not? There are no many benefits like blah.. blah.. Why won&#x2019;t you become a member?&#x201D;<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Which card do you have? Why don&#x2019;t you pay this way rather than that?&#x201D;<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Would you need a shopping bag? 1 Large? Or 2 medium?&#x201D;</p> <p>It&#x2019;s an unending sequence of dreadful moments till I leave the shopping mall. But this time it ended in slightly different manner. I was offered an offer which am convinced now must have been part of some psychological study. The lady behind the billing counter explained it to me somewhat like this (emphasis her and mine).</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Sir, you made a purchase worth a specific, <em>nontrivial</em> amount, so you <em>stand a chance</em> to win an assured gift. This is <em>not</em> a lucky draw, you will win some gift<a href="#footnote-1FNX" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-1FNX"><sup>1</sup></a> for sure. All you have to do is pay a <em>significant</em> amount. That will make you eligible (<em>wasn&#x2019;t I already?</em>) for this assured gift. And the cost of the cheapest assured gift is twice as higher than the price you pay (<em>how can I verify</em>). So, of course, I should include that, right?&#x201D;</p> <p>So, in short, it is pay (over and above what you have already paid for the shopping) to win assuredly? Like what you would do in a casino - but with some surety angle? Why not just have an aisle full of assured gift cards? Why link it to billing? I couldn&#x2019;t help but think it had to do with the fact that my abilities to think rationally are depleted due to the exhaustion from the decisions made earlier during shopping. And my mind is at my most vulnerable state.</p> <p>With the pressure from the people queued behind me growing, I nervously said yes. But within seconds, pushed by the pressure from my rational mind, I said no. I wasn&#x2019;t ready to undergo the scrutiny of my thoughts.</p> <section class="footnotes"> <hr /> <ol> <li id="footnote-1FNX"><p>The gifts included bedrolls, luggages, some <span class="small-caps">OLED</span> television set, bikes and even car.<a href="#ref-1FNX" class="footnote-back">&#x21A9;</a></p></li> </ol> </section>

			 <p>Every now and then, I wonder about that time when I am at my creative best. It is, rather, everyone&#x2019;s desire to find that time, that place, those tools that make them more <em>productive</em> at being <em>creative</em>.</p> <p>However, I have realized over the years that being productive and being creative are antithetical more often than not. There are times when I am at my creative best, I do something that I have never done&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;say, I doodle the best I ever have&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;and my brain considers this to be a non-productive use of the time I had at my hands. Why? Because that wasn&#x2019;t the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>plan&#x201D;.</p> <p>Productivity can be measured, <em>quantified</em>. Creativity can&#x2019;t be. As a result, productivity is always driven by one&#x2019;s overly thinking brain while creativity is a response to a curious mind.</p> <p>The essential spirit of creativity is captured brilliantly in this quote from Wayne Dyer.</p> <blockquote> <p>Everything that&#x2019;s created comes out of silence. Your thoughts emerge from the nothingness of silence. Your words come out of this void. Your very essence emerged from emptiness. All creativity requires some stillness.</p> </blockquote> <p>That&#x2019;s so meaningful&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;no doubt that one often fails to think creatively these days. Our minds are ruffled all the time by the distractions of our digital life. So every so often, I am on the lookout for that stillness.</p>

			 <p>Apple Arcade needs instant play - similar to the <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/google-play-instant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instant apps on Android</a>. It is extremely frustrating to wait for huge games to download before you can even try them. With a huge list of games, downloading every one of them is overkill. More so with Apple&#x2019;s stingy storage plans.</p>

			 <p>I am not a gamer. I cannot play a single-person shooter. I was ok with this particular style of gaming when it was on desktop, with a keyboard and a mouse. On mobile, I am terrible. I just can&#x2019;t make sense of the direction or speed. And completely pathetic in multiplayer situations.</p> <p>Same applies to the racing games. It was ok till it was simple <em>lane following</em> games, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Fighter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Road Fighter</a>. But then they become a lot more real.</p> <p>Actually, the quest to be more real with the gameplay and the graphics killed this form of media for me. It made the controls a lot more convoluted to be fun any more. Arcade-type games had some breezy liveliness to them. But gradually, gaming became a lot more serious, a lot more pro for my casual taste. These pros ruined the arcade in a way.</p> <p>Of course, that doesn&#x2019;t mean there do not exist casual games. There do. However, most of them are ruined by the freemium model. And I am not the first one complaining about this.</p> <p>But what that meant was even the casual gamer in me had recently died&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;pushed way back for the fear of the effort it would take to find that one good, clean casual game. Like <a href="https://www.monumentvalleygame.com/mv2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monument Valley</a> or <a href="http://altosadventure.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alto&#x2019;s Adventure</a>.</p> <p>So I was pretty excited with the announcement of Apple Arcade. I am especially pleased with Apple&#x2019;s aggressive pricing and push in the non-US markets and the initial reviews of the games. These sound like the games that match my taste.</p> <p>I hope these stay the way they are currently. I hope the pros do not ruin the Arcade again.</p>

			 <p>I recently changed the pair of glasses I was using.

I am surprised that there is still no better and foolproof way to do this than actually putting glasses of increasing powers on your face.</p> <p>Or if there does exist a better way to do this, may be I need to visit those clinics.</p> <p>Anyway, thankfully this time I was lucky with my glasses - I think the frame does look good on my face.</p>

			 <p>I have been planning to refresh the look of my blog for quite some time now. I, <em>finally</em>, managed to get the things changed a bit today.</p> <p>The biggest change was the addition of the theme switcher&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;if you don&#x2019;t want to read with a light background, you can change the whole theme with a toggle at the top-right corner. I haven&#x2019;t made it any fancier than it needs to be, it is a plain simple round button.</p> <p>I was a bit hesitant for a long time to put a manual theme switcher on the home page. I thought anyone can already change the way they read the content with the reader mode of the browser. However, what&#x2019;s the fun in that. Plus I never found that one perfect mode <em>I</em> liked across the devices and browsers. So I decided to include one that at least I would enjoy reading right here.</p> <p>I have also added the support for <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> media query to future proof it against the upcoming system-wide (iOS, Android, macOS, Windows) dark mode preference - no manual toggle for you if you are on a dark mode on your system. I haven&#x2019;t tested this thoroughly yet though. I will continue to experiment with this further.</p> <p>I am very picky with the fonts and the colors I choose across the site. So I did not want to touch the existing setup till I was sure I had enough time to get this done properly.</p>

			 <p>Recently, I have been seriously considering moving my Wordpress account to a paid plan. It hosts <a href="https://snoozyrealm.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my old blog</a> with posts from ages ago&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;it currently acts as an archive of the un-migrated posts for me.</p> <p>There is a reason why I am a bit itchy with my writing workflow. I am struggling to get stuff written across systems, mainly mobile and desktops, at home and work, with drafts kept in sync. Sure, I can use Dropbox as my file store and access the draft posts using iA Writer or other Markdown text editors. However, I am very particular with not signing into and linking anything personal on my work machine, so this workflow does not work at work.</p> <p>I would have really liked something that is web based. I have been, since long, trying to find <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/1561697966995">a micropub client</a> with a satisfying writing experience for long form posts, along with drafts support. I still haven&#x2019;t found one. Neither have my attempts to just create one ground up gone anywhere, mainly for the need for multiple working drafts.</p> <p>I do have a Netlify <span class="small-caps">CMS</span> setup for my <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/">main Hugo driven website</a>. However, though it works fine from a desktop, it has a terrible experience on mobile.</p> <p>Wordpress solves this particular problem for me. I have come to realize <em>finally</em> that it has a nice, clean writing interface on desktop. And with its stable mobile app, the workflow is manageable on mobile too.</p> <p>But, boy I am ruined by markdown - I can&#x2019;t write in<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Rich Text&#x201D; any more. Plus, I can&#x2019;t host my posts on a website which does not have the Indieweb principles baked in. I am aware that Wordpress has a IndieWeb plugin. However, one needs a business account to install plugins. And that&#x2019;s too much of a cost to sign up for this casual experiment.</p> <p>So my search for the online writing interface with support for sync and drafts and satisfactory interface on desktop and mobile continues. With Wordpress, it&#x2019;s so close, but far.</p>

			 <p>I am tired of people making fun of a feature just because <em>they</em> cannot think of a use for that. This attitude recently came to the fore with Apple&#x2019;s introduction of<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>slofies&#x201D; - the slow-motion selfies. The call for<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>stop trying to make slofies happen&#x201D; was loud and clear from the tech community. Apparently,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span><a href="https://twitter.com/dmoren/status/1174362422418784256" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no one else wants to use it</a><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span> because <em>we</em> do not want to use it.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s a terrible take. Sure, may be the feature can be graded low on the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>usefulness&#x201D; parameter, but it stands high on the fun scale. And our smartphones today are the most personal devices we carry around with us today, and that is not just because they are useful. They are equally fun too.</p> <p>So stop mocking anything that you will not use. Selfies. Crazy filters. Slow-motion videos. Loop and Bounce effects - the boomerangs. They all make these dull devices a lot more fun. And their fun factor is what makes them sell in masses.</p>

			 <p>I wonder what the purists think of the recent computational photography trend.</p> <p>Google started it with its all-in-cloud touch up of the photos. And then they moved it on-device in the camera app. Every photo one took was stitched together from multiple shots with different settings. And eventually each <span class="small-caps">OEM</span> made their cameras smarter,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>AI-driven&#x201D;.</p> <p>Latest iPhone 11 stitches a single photo from 4 under exposed frames taken before the shutter button is clicked, one normal picture and 1 over exposed frame. They call this process semantic rendering. What follows is some heavy processing. Here&#x2019;s snippet from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868727/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review-camera-battery-life-screen-midnight-green-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge&#x2019;s review</a> of iPhone 11 Pro review.</p> <blockquote> <p>Smart <span class="small-caps">HDR</span> looks for things in the photos it understands: the sky, faces, hair, facial hair, things like that. Then it uses the additional detail from the underexposed and overexposed frames to selectively process those areas of the image: hair gets sharpened, the sky gets de-noised but not sharpened, faces get relighted to make them look more even, and facial hair gets sharpened up. Smart <span class="small-caps">HDR</span> is also now less aggressive with highlights and shadows. Highlights on faces aren&#x2019;t corrected as aggressively as before because those highlights make photos look more natural, but other highlights and shadows are corrected to regain detail.</p> </blockquote> <p>What you get as a result is an extremely clear picture with each object in the photo appropriately visible.</p> <p>But with so much processing of each image, should this even be called photography any more? Here&#x2019;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia introducing</a> the term.</p> <blockquote> <p>Photography is the art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.</p> </blockquote> <p>What we do with our smartphones is neither an art nor is it creating a single image.</p> <p>All parts of the photos are independently captured (and even pre-captured) with the best suited settings, processed post-capture, with even some <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207310" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live</a> sections including audio recorded. This is not<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>creating an image&#x201D; any more.</p> <p>Someone might say it all started when the digital photography became mainstream - when the physical limitations of the analog methods did not constrain the person with a camera in his hand. However, what we capture is no longer a single image anymore. A more apt term for these might be<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>visual memories&#x201D;. Common people are interested in doing just that, they don&#x2019;t care if they are called photographers.</p> <p>Let Photography stay an art.</p>

After all, it is just clay, plain simple clay. I remember a time, as a child, when we regularly played in and with clay.

I was always the obedient one, but even I deferred at times.</p> <p>I remember one such rainy evening&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;we friends neglected not one, but many such <em>restrictions</em>. It had been raining cats and dogs throughout the day, our playground was muddy wet. And the only game that we knew of that we could play in such conditions was football<a href="#footnote-1ZOB" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-1ZOB"><sup>1</sup></a>. We only played this English game on those rare occasions when playing cricket wasn&#x2019;t feasible. And today was one such day.</p> <p>Ground was slippery and it continued to rain. So of course, playing wasn&#x2019;t going to be easier. Running around with the ball by our legs was a big task. Especially for us occasional footballers. So it was only natural that there would be one tenderfoot who would slip and fall down. And he won&#x2019;t like running around alone with the dirty clothes. So he would pull someone else around. And those two would a few others. It didn&#x2019;t take long for all of us to resemble <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4z1CY6nTmY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the ugly prisoners of The Longest Yard</a>.</p> <p>It was only after getting crazy laden with mud that we realized, boy oh boy, we were in big trouble. It wasn&#x2019;t just our clothes that were dirty. The whole of us was. And it had already gotten dark and we had to cross a section of woods to get back home.</p> <p>To add to our troubles, it had also stopped raining. So the only way for us to clean ourselves up was with the water dripping from the trees in the woods. We did try that, we shook the trees violently at times. But all the attempts were in vain. Now we were not just wet and dirty, but also itchy. That day, I quietly entered the home through the door at the back, went straight to the shower under cold water and even washed off the clothes with my hands.</p> <p>The walk through the woods that day followed by that cold shower were one of the most tense moments of my childhood.</p> <p>I still convince myself that my mom did not see me ugly that day.</p> <p>I know the cutesy games that my daughter plays with her Play-Doh can never be compared to our ugly rolling all over in the mud. But I still haven&#x2019;t succeeded in explaining my mom how someone managed to bottle some clay and make it one of the hottest selling toy in the world.</p> <section class="footnotes"> <hr /> <ol> <li id="footnote-1ZOB"><p>English football, Soccer for the <span class="small-caps">US</span> readers.<a href="#ref-1ZOB" class="footnote-back">&#x21A9;</a></p></li> </ol> </section>

			 <p>It was a <em>different</em> day today. It was a <em>different</em> birthday today.</p> <p>There was no late night, or early morning, cake cutting celebrations. Because I have come to prefer a time when my daughter is completely awake and can thoroughly enjoy the celebrations.</p> <p>There was no partying in the night with food that my family doesn&#x2019;t enjoy. Because what matters more is everyone around me has a great time.</p> <p>There were no loud and over-the-top plans&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;just a day of togetherness with people that matter the most to me. Of course, that also meant things couldn&#x2019;t just be perfect.</p> <p>There was a crazy rush to get ready and cut traffic to reach theaters so that we can watch a show of movie with the whole family together. There were discussions, to the point of exasperation, over the inevitable traffic jams and the needless security checks. There were squabbles over meaningless stuff that ended with guffaws and family portraits. Even awkward at times.</p> <p>But all said, it was a day well spent. Everyone decided to stay home. And everyone tried their best to make my day special.</p> <p>I do not have great pictures captured of the day. But I have some wonderful memories made. It was a different, a <em>special</em> day today.</p>

			 <p>I wonder what&#x2019;s the best way to make note of the fleeting thoughts, say adding an item to a list of things that one needs to do. I know my memory is not my friend here&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;it gobbles stuff, but fails to let it out timely.</p> <p>Digital methods are easy to use, convenient, but are unnatural. You lose touch, context, of the written words after some time. They end up being a plain dump of words with no background.</p> <p>I can capture more context with analog methods&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;a quick sketch or the current location&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;but it isn&#x2019;t convenient. Either I do not have a piece of paper handy or I can&#x2019;t stop and capture the thought (being in middle of traffic, let&#x2019;s say) right at that moment.</p> <p>I am waiting for the day the digital assistants would be smarter to help capture such thought. Today they aren&#x2019;t. First, they can&#x2019;t be easily summoned&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;&#x201C;Ok Google&#x201D; or<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Hey Siri&#x201D; doesn&#x2019;t work in middle of traffic, blaring horns or loud chatters.</p> <p>Second, they are terrible at capturing unformed thoughts. They need structured inputs, which quick notes aren&#x2019;t. Using digital assistants today is a painful battle between reality and expectations. Former is driven by the technology limitations, later by the out-right spurious promises in the advertisements.</p> <p>With all said and done though, I have recently - and after enduring lot of pain - learned that heavy reliance on one&#x2019;s smartphone to lead a structured life is not very sensible to do. There is a chance that it can lead to utter chaos when you don&#x2019;t have your device on you. It can completely paralyze you for thoughts.</p>

			 <blockquote> <p>We worry about face recognition just as we worried about databases - we worry what happens if they contain bad data and we worry what bad people might do with them.</p> </blockquote> <p>A great post by Benedict Evans where he compares our fears around usage of facial recognition technology, and in extension the <span class="small-caps">AI</span> and data hoarding, to the fears we had when data gathering and analysis capabilities of databases was being introduced. Some comparisons are indeed apt. And some fears, of course misguided and misplaced.</p> <p>Gathering data inherently isn&#x2019;t bad&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;it is the fact that it enables bad people to use it in bad manner that everyone knowledgeable worries about. So, the call for regulating the usage of the data isn&#x2019;t unjustified. However, the exaggerated and far-fetched fall-outs of data misuses, and the recent own goals by the big corps, like Facebook, Google and others, are just making regulators around the world shoot for the easiest target out there&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;their ability to collect data.</p> <blockquote> <p>The challenge here, I think, is to work out the right level of abstraction. When Bernie Madoff&#x2019;s Ponzi scheme imploded, we didn&#x2019;t say that Excel needed tighter regulation or that his landlord should have spotted what he was doing - the right layer to intervene was within financial services. Equally, we regulate financial services, but mortgages, credit cards, the stock market and retail banks&#x2019; capital requirements are all handled very separately. A law that tries to regulate using your face to unlock your phone, or turn yourself into a kitten, and also a system for spotting loyalty-card holders in a supermarket, and to determine where the police can use cameras and how they can store data, is unlikely to be very effective.</p> </blockquote>

			 <p>For my 5 year old daughter who just watched another magician perform, magic is a skill that is matched by nothing else. It is something that she continues to believe that her father can perform&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;and something that she is learning to perform.</p> <p>For me, magic is the silliness that I willingly become part of just to watch my daughter, impressed, giggle. Magic is that feeling when I watch her jump around excitedly after I pull a coin from behind her ear or after I make things disappear and reappear out of thin air.</p> <p>Magic is what happens when I spend more mindful time with my daughter and my family. When the distractions of the day to day digital life lay forgotten in some corner of the home. When my daughter lends a spontaneous burst of energy and everyone around just joins in on her imaginative games. When there is nothing playing in the background expect for the chatters and guffaws or even complete silence at times. When everyone I love is <em>around</em> me, <em>with</em> me.</p> <p>That is when magic happens.</p>

			 <p>Recently, my reading habits have been pleasantly satisfying. If not something that I can be proud of, or anything that&#x2019;s comparable to the voracious readers I know of, at least I am glad they are far improved. It is only the start of September and I have already met <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/8863-2019-reading-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my Goodreads challenge</a>- 4 books ahead of schedule. I understand it was a small target this time - book a month - but I was worried I would not meet even that. I am happy that I did it so comfortably.</p> <p>It is the use of Audible that has led me to at least stay on track for the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>book a month&#x201D; target. Every credit I got in the month was excitedly utilized. I say<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>excitedly&#x201D; because I used to be keen to get a new credit and identify a new book at the start of every month. Of course, it meant I had to change the habits of my<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>reading&#x201D; - rather listening. <em>No podcasts. No music in car.</em> It had to be a book.</p> <p>I thought I would always have one. This month proved that would not be the case always. I was through with the audiobook&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;the brilliant <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34506.The_Light_Fantastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second in the Discworld series</a> from Terry Pratchett&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;in the first week itself. Audible is wonderful!</p> <p>This allowed me time to kindle my <em>reading</em> habit next. So, well, my old Kindle had to get recharged and be ready to serve. And serve it did. It was great to complete reading one book and get in the middle of another&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;right after finishing the audible book. There are times when I can&#x2019;t listen&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;or may be I can avoid listening. Especially when I have a limited time at hand. For example while standing in a short queue. Kindle app on my phone has taken that mind space. It is better than letting the stream of some social network, mainly Twitter or YouTube, pollute my mind with some useless posts.</p> <p>So August was brilliant from reading perspective for me - 2.5 books read. I want to continue doing so in the remaining year too.</p> <hr /> <p>There is one book that I just can&#x2019;t get back to, the latest in the Cormoron Strike from J.K.Rowling. This one has stayed there in the list of my<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>currently reading&#x201D; books for more than a year now. I am ~30% in. And I am no way inclined to pick it up again. It is not that I do not enjoy the Strike series. I do. I have throughly enjoyed the first three books. But there is something about the latest one, or the time when I am reading it and the state of my mind, that makes me uninterested in story it narrates. Or the way it narrates it.</p> <p>I may have to drop it for now, move it to couldn&#x2019;t complete. May I will attempt to read it again with a fresh perspective. And at a new phase.</p>

			 <p>I have met two types of customer service representatives. There is a section that is trained to listen to what the customer has to be say and serve her rightly. It may, at times, involve sailing through the tirade that the angry, unsatisfied customer unleashes on them. They wait for the right moment to pacify them with a solution that does actually solve the problem that she has.</p> <p>Then there is another section that neither calms a customer down nor solve her problem. They just passively ignore the blabber and just move on to what they had to do right from the beginning&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;lead her to another queue.</p> <p>Both these sections pacify the customer by making her tired.</p> <p>But there is another section, though in minority, that I come across with a pleasant surprise. They do not listen to your tirade - they even engage, if necessary. They make you realize that your anger is unjustified at the moment, at the place and is against a person that does not deserve to be shouted at. They pacify you by not making you tired, but by <em>tersely</em> moving on to the actual problem that should be addressed. It demands a degree of confidence in one&#x2019;s knowledge and experience and belief in understanding the customer need better to belong in this group.</p> <p>Which section fits the standard schooling of customer care, is more effective in addressing the customer needs is undoubtedly debatable. I believe majority of the people may prefer the patience and calmness of the first group. But at times, it is the concise interaction of the final group that is beneficial for all parties involved.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2019/09/01/230000.html">A Month of Bullet Journaling</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2019/09/01/230000.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-09-01 23:00:00 &#43;0530">Sep 1, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It&#x2019;s been around a month since <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/1564027700657">I started</a> maintaining a bullet journal (BuJo, as it is called <em>with love</em>). It has been an enlightening month - I have learned so much about my habits and the way my mind works.</p> <p>Of course, this wasn&#x2019;t my first attempt at maintaining a journal or of planning myself, my life through an organizer. There have been many <em>failed</em> new year resolutions that have led to me buying, keeping and planning my days and months in the traditional journals - ones with days, months written on every page. With every day that I had failed to make an entry in, I had lost my interest in writing or planning another today. I just wasn&#x2019;t organized enough each day, everyday to keep myself, well, organized.</p> <p>However, I love, <em>love</em> updating my <em>personal</em> bullet journal daily. I believe the analog method of doing so is one big reason behind the change. Thoughts flow freely through the pen on to the paper&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;a lot more so than they do digitally. There is something about the legibility (illegibility, to be fair) of the <strong>handwritten words</strong> that lowers some mental hurdles. I always wondered, and even subconsciously ridiculed, the fascination a section of my social circle had with the pen and paper - <a href="https://www.penaddict.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the pen addicts</a>. But I do fathom the allure now.</p> <p>The fact that I could be more organized with BuJo by being less organized at times was neat. The process of<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>maintaining&#x201D; a journal feels a lot less formal and this casualness has done wonders for my journaling/organizing attempts. The whole concept of <strong>rapid logging</strong> - capturing thoughts as bulleted lists - worked brilliantly for me. It was ok to miss bullets for a day. It was ok to not have any tasks, but only notes for a day. It was ok to not complete tasks on the day, or even in the week that it was written&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;just migrate it to a new page. It&#x2019;s perfect for my moody, erratic, unorganized mind.</p> <p>A month of <strong>habit tracking</strong> has also been delightful. This is what I was tracking when <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/1565083636179">I started this habit of tracking habits</a> - morning walk/run, publish 100 words every day, measure weight, three meals a day and regular sleep routine.</p> <p><img src="http://blog.amitgawande.com/_img/bujo-habit-tracker.jpeg" alt="Bullet Journal Habit Tracking"></p> <p>And boy, have I learned stuff about what makes me carry through any habits. Some habits are easy, some are way too difficult.</p> <ul> <li>Habits that I thought would be a cakewalk to follow, turned out to be a walk in a desert. Those I thought would need more push from my side came just naturally.</li> <li>I had thought 100 words to be published daily would be the most difficult task for me to stick to. Three meals/morning walks would be difficult, but not so much. Nah ah. It is apparently easier for me to do things I enjoy doing (<em>bruh, of course</em>) - so I wrote daily more often than I jogged or controlled eating. However, I thoroughly enjoyed attempting to stick to all the three daily, so I plan to continue to track them.</li> <li>Measuring one&#x2019;s weight daily does nothing but act as a deterrent when you are trying to lose your weight. It is easier to do, but useless. Anything that I <em>shouldn&#x2019;t be</em> doing daily doesn&#x2019;t need to be on the tracker.</li> <li>Maintaining regular sleep routine was something I did almost daily. But this tracking was also the most ineffective of the lot. I think I know the reason - I just wasn&#x2019;t specific enough with my target.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Regular&#x201D; and<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>routine&#x201D; are subjective. So any sleep more than 7 hours was fine&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;didn&#x2019;t matter if it was pleasant or how I felt when I woke up. I do want to sign myself up for a good sleep routine. So this particular item would need some changes.</li> </ul> <p>With all the learnings, I decided to continue with my habit tracker, with some tweaking. This is what I would track as my daily habits for the next month.</p> <ul> <li>Rise by 6 <span class="small-caps">AM</span></li> <li>Morning Walk/Run</li> <li>Morning Pages</li> <li>Publish 100 Words</li> <li>3 Meals/day</li> <li>Sleep by 11 <span class="small-caps">PM</span></li> </ul> <p>Since I started maintaining a bullet journal, I have also started carrying along a small diary that I mainly use for the <strong>morning pages</strong>. It helps me declutter my mind to a limit. Do I see benefits? I believe it is too early to say. But it is something I do want to carry on.</p> <p><img src="http://blog.amitgawande.com/_img/bujo-aug.jpeg" alt="Bullet Journal"></p> <p>It has been a wonderful month of reorganizing the way I lead my life with journals. Is it worth all the effort I have to go through? Only time will tell. But it for sure has made some aspects of my life more fun.</p>

Nope, not at all.</p> <p>You can&#x2019;t plan for events that haven&#x2019;t been scheduled yet.</p> <p>You can&#x2019;t plan for the back to back birthdays you haven&#x2019;t been invited to yet.</p> <p>You can&#x2019;t plan for friends and relatives remembering and visiting you after ages.</p> <p>And you can&#x2019;t plan for the sudden feeling of illness, of exhaustion this whole running around leaves you with.</p> <p>Could I have avoided any of that? Did I not welcome any of what happened? No, of course not. But what I ended up doing is sit alone at my desk, physically and mentally sick and tired, trying to calm things down. To Breathe.</p> <p>Because there&#x2019;s no way to plan against the unplanned, against irregularity.</p>

			 <p>Making attempts to understand what the future holds is understandable, but it is pointless to think too much about that. Thinking about all the possibilities of things going wrong.

What if it does not? How would my current <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/making-decisions">decision</a> play out in the future?</p> <p>And there is possibly a stream of such questions clouding one&#x2019;s mind at any given point.</p> <p>What matters is to realise that there are no easy answers to these questions. May be there are no answers at all. Of course, it doesn&#x2019;t mean one should not think of future at all. It is important to appreciate the effects that one&#x2019;s today is going to have on his or her future. But that thought can&#x2019;t be a deterrent to the movement, to progress.</p> <p>It is like walking through a foggy street. Sure, you can think of all the unknowns that may lie ahead on the path. But that can&#x2019;t make you stagnant. Else you reach no where.</p> <p>And unlike fog, future never clears out to reveal what lies ahead.</p>

			 <p>What is silence? Is it the lack of any sound or is it the lack of any discernible sound? What do you need to attain calmness?</p> <p>Today, I sat alone, reading for around an hour - time that I was the most focused in a very long time. I felt I was alone, I physically wasn&#x2019;t. I realised this only once I was out of my trance.</p> <p>I was surrounded by a persistent hustle-bustle of the regularities of a working day. People chattering over a cup of coffee. Muffled, at the same time distinctly recognisable, voices of the labourers working outside the window. Rambles of the passing trains every now and then.</p> <p>There was a lot of sound, a lot of noise around me. But there was silence within - I have come to realise it works way better to calm one down than the silence outside.</p>

When the first explorers from the warm lands around the Circle Sea travelled into the chilly hinterland they filled in the blank spaces on their maps by grabbing the nearest native, pointing at some distant landmark, speaking very clearly in a loud voice, and writing down whatever the bemused man told them. Thus were immortalised in generations of atlases such geographical oddities as Just A Mountain, I Don&#x2019;t Know, What? and, of course, Your Finger You Fool.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Rainclouds clustered around the bald heights of Mt.

			 <p>Patience is a virtue that is rapidly getting extinct within us. Everything digital has trained us to expect everything instant. You want to read, watch, listen to, learn, earn? <em>There&#x2019;s an app for that.</em></p> <p>We were ruined, further, by the advances in efficient service distribution at scale. You need things delivered - <em>there&#x2019;s a service for that</em>. Groceries? <em>Yeah, those are covered</em>. Food? Cab? Stationery? <em>Yep, we got those covered too.</em></p> <p>Services would reach you earlier after a week or more, if at all they could reach you. It became days. One day was a stretch goal that was soon met for many. And next was hours. For many services, it is minutes now. <em>30 minutes or free</em>.</p> <p>We have all been ruined by this promise of<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>instant&#x201D;. A detour of 15 minutes before the food is delivered is worthy of a lengthy rant at the service provider now. A delay of a day before one&#x2019;s headphone is delivered is intolerable.</p> <p>Days of patiently waiting for things we need, we <em>want</em> have long been lost. We are ruined by our lack of patience.</p> <hr /> <p>Martin Weigert has an interesting take on this - this is what he wrote while sharing this essay as part if <a href="https://meshedsociety.com/meshedsociety-weekly-229/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his weekly newsletter</a> at Meshed Soceity.</p> <blockquote> <p>(&#x2026;) there are at least 2 types of patience: Waiting for the pay offs of one&#x2019;s work (whether on oneself or external projects), and waiting for things one needs. I consider the first type a virtue. The latter type however, seems to be mostly a mental hack to make a virtue out of necessity. Have to wait for 4 hours to get your 5 minutes at the doctor? Be patient! Have to wait one week to get the thing you bought online? Be patient! Have to wait one day until your bank transfer has been processed? Be patient! In these cases, there is nothing inherently virtuous or positive in waiting.</p> </blockquote> <p>I do not disagree with any part of this. And I was indeed focused on the second type that he talked about because that&#x2019;s primary what he face more often and so is what that tests us the most. It is important that we do not lose our sanity if things do go wrong while we wait for things and have to wait longer.</p>

What, then, one has to decide is whether the change was good or bad, and so whether the decision made was right or wrong.</p> <p>This judgement that follows after every decision invariably forces one to question whether it was worth the enforced change. The fear of making the wrong decision is the reason, more often than not, behind the lack inclination to change.</p> <p>You can be deciding what gift to buy for someone or who to choose to be your life partner. It does not matter whether the decision to be made is critical or trivial. Our subconscious is always at work, judging our every decision.</p> <p>However, it is up to you to not let this fear of judgement drive how you lead your life.

But it vehemently gets back at you. If not on the very next day, you have to pay back in the week that follows. For days in a row. It is better to let sleep carry on with its routine.</p>

			 <p>A brilliant essay at New Yorker on A.I. and intellectual debt, output of an often employed<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>approach to discovery &#x2014; answers first, explanations later&#x201D;. I was aware of, but never thought in detail on what would be the implications of letting independent, isolated machine learning models interact freely. This example is indeed eyeopening.</p> <blockquote> <p>In 2011, a biologist named Michael Eisen found out, from one of his students, that the least-expensive copy of an otherwise unremarkable used book&#x2014;&#x201C;The Making of a Fly: The Genetics of Animal Design&#x201D;&#x2014;was available on Amazon for $1.7 million, plus $3.99 shipping. The second-cheapest copy cost $2.1 million. The respective sellers were well established, with thousands of positive reviews between them. When Eisen visited the book&#x2019;s Amazon page several days in a row, he discovered that the prices were increasing continually, in a regular pattern. Seller A&#x2019;s price was consistently 99.83 per cent that of Seller B; Seller B&#x2019;s price was reset, every day, to 127.059 per cent of Seller A&#x2019;s. Eisen surmised that Seller A had a copy of the book, and was seeking to undercut the next-cheapest price. Seller B, meanwhile, didn&#x2019;t have a copy, and so priced the book higher; if someone purchased it, B could order it, on that customer&#x2019;s behalf, from A.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Each seller&#x2019;s presumed strategy was rational. It was the interaction of their algorithms that produced irrational results. The interaction of thousands of machine-learning systems in the wild promises to be much more unpredictable.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yep, indeed. May be such interactions need more control? May be we have one more thing about <span class="small-caps">AI</span> to worry about?</p> <blockquote> <p>Much of the timely criticism of artificial intelligence has rightly focussed on the ways in which it can go wrong: it can create or replicate bias; it can make mistakes; it can be put to evil ends. We should also worry, though, about what will happen when A.I. gets it right.</p> </blockquote>

			 <blockquote> <p>Written languages based on alphabets are one of the great human accomplishments. (&#x2026;) when I write the word<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>human&#x201D; you can fill in what you imagine a human to look like. The word itself carries some fundamental attributes of being a human but the rest is intentionally underspecified. This allows us to use a single word that applies independent of gender, nationality, race, clothing, etc. That is the power of language based on alphabets, because the letters themselves carry no meaning. Even the meaning of a word can evolve over time. For example, the word<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>couple&#x201D; at one point might have meant a male-female couple but is now used to describe any two people who are paired.</p> </blockquote> <p>A thoughtful essay, but I completely disagree. There is an innate assumption here that everyone can read and write English alphabet. It is, in reality, not the case. There are tons of alphabets across nations and regions. In India itself, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_writing_systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there are 11 alphabets</a>. My mom can fluently read and write Devanagari, but that is not the case with English alphabets.</p> <p>Emoji cross the confines of regions - primarily because it is visual. Is it perfect? Of course, not&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;we have managed to mess up the standards in <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/78kzn9/what-the-emoji-youre-sending-actually-look-like-to-your-friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">implementation across platforms</a>.</p> <p>However, at least, I can send my mom a<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>smile&#x201D; emoji without spelling it out in Devanagari. It was the first thing that lent her confidence to start using smartphones, way before Devanagari support was even introduced.</p>

			 <p>A really great article summarizing the perils of files and writes and file systems. And also on why exactly consumers should care. Especially, the below excerpt on cost of data corruption is bang on.</p> <blockquote> <p>(&#x2026;) if we look at how consumer software works, it&#x2019;s usually quite unsafe with respect to handling data. <span class="small-caps">IMO</span>, the key difference here is that when a huge tech company loses data, whether that&#x2019;s data on who&#x2019;s likely to click on which ads or user emails, the company pays the cost, directly or indirectly and the cost is large enough that it&#x2019;s obviously correct to spend a lot of effort to avoid data loss. But when consumers have data corruption on their own machines, they&#x2019;re mostly not sophisticated enough to know who&#x2019;s at fault, so the company can avoid taking the brunt of the blame. If we have a global optimization function, the math is the same&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;of course we should put more effort into protecting data on consumer machines. But if we&#x2019;re a company that&#x2019;s locally optimizing for our own benefit, the math works out differently and maybe it&#x2019;s not worth it to spend a lot of effort on avoiding data corruption.</p> </blockquote>

			 <p>I picked up this book just as a filler&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;something I read in between when am in no mental state of anything serious. Or something that will make me think. Or will make me sad. So I had very little expectations going in. And the book met my expectations to the T. It wasn&#x2019;t terrible. But I don&#x2019;t think I will remember any part of it after even a month.</p> <p>I have now given up on many<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>memoirs&#x201D; which are nothing more than essays on varied topic. I have realized that they simply don&#x2019;t interest me. Especially humor ones. Fact that I could sit through and complete this book is in itself a surprise for me.</p> <p>One thing that might have worked in favor somewhat is that I listened to this book rather than reading it. I think the experience must have been a tad better. Because&#xA0;..uhmm.. Ellen. But the content just was too patchy overall. Some essays were brilliantly written. They talked about some nice little ideas. And with Ellen&#x2019;s easy-on-ears style of narrating, they made me laugh. Some even made me think. Her journal entries while on beach or her thoughts on having (<em>not?</em>) kids, to note a couple, are damn funny.</p> <p>Others, however, - and there many to be frank - were terrible. Her haikus or bucket lists were just horrible. I don&#x2019;t even know why were there in the book. They weren&#x2019;t funny. They had no reason. They were just&#xA0;.. there. Wish if the chapters that weren&#x2019;t funny at least made me learn something about Ellen&#x2019;s life. Nope. Didn&#x2019;t do even that. Few had just 4-5 words. Not something I enjoy - sorry. Even when I have very low expectations.</p> <p>All in all, this is a terrible memoir, okiesh essay collection, a breezy audiobook. You can listen through it completely over a long drive. You won&#x2019;t miss a thing while you place and collect your order at a drive through. Don&#x2019;t pause. Don&#x2019;t replay. Just let it play on through your drive.</p> <p>Content gets 2 stars. Ellen gets another star. However, I don&#x2019;t think I will pick up another of her earlier books any time soon though. Or any of the essay/memoirs. I am done with this genre.</p>

			 <p>Apple also wants to serve exclusive podcasts now. This recent craze of everyone coming up with their own exclusive content - movies, shows and podcasts now - is really nonsensical to me. Netflix and Amazon started it with their original content and, although arguable, achieved some moderate success.</p> <p>However, we are already seeing trends - if Netflix&#x2019;s recent quarter&#x2019;s earnings are any indication - of people losing interest. One reason I believe (and suffer from) is the sheer quantity of the content available to be consumed. After all, there is only so much time a person can spend glued to their screens- in addition to the time he already spends scrolling through the unlimited stream of bite sized posts.</p> <p>As I had argued earlier, podcast <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/podcasts-is-a-costly-medium-even-for-listeners">is not a light medium for consumption</a>. It is not music. It is not audiobooks. It is a medium known for culturing the relationship with the listeners over years. Listeners choose whom they form that relationship with by subscribing to a podcast.</p> <p>And they are already weighed down by the choices they <em>have to</em> make.</p>

			 <p>So India lost to New Zealand in Semi-Final of the <span class="small-caps">ICC</span> world cup 2019. I have some thoughts.</p> <ol type="1"> <li>It&#x2019;s heartbreaking as hell. Almost at a level of 2003 Final defeat to Australia.</li> <li>Fact that India lost doesn&#x2019;t make it a bad team. They had a couple of shortcomings&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;all surfaced together at the most inopportune phase of the tournament.</li> <li>India had a light middle order, fear was top order failure would be challenging for them to handle&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;exactly what happened.</li> <li>You can&#x2019;t call yourself the champions as long as you keep depending solely on your top 3 and bottom 3 players for majority of the matches. It was always risky going in. There are no bowlers who can bat or batsman who can ball. Something that 1983 and 2011 <span class="small-caps">WC</span> winning Indian cricket teams have in common.</li> <li>Players like Sachin and Sehwag and Yuvraj and Raina who could always spring a surprise and give you a wicket - in addition to the runs they score - were dearly missed.</li> <li>Specifically this match was a series of wrong choices - review lost unnecessarily on the first ball. Tweaking of the settled bowling unit, and also the team towards the later part of the tournament. Dhoni&#x2019;s batting position, especially after early wickets - he had to have walked in at 5/3.</li> </ol> <p>Anyway, all said and done, India remain a very good cricket team. They need to work on the middle order - identify those players who bring in a secondary skill. They haven&#x2019;t lost any respect&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;it&#x2019;s a sport afterall. For someone to win, someone&#x2019;s to lose.</p>

			 <p>Chris Richards, putting his perspective through, does kick a hornet&#x2019;s nest. Something even I have done earlier.</p> <blockquote> <p>I&#x2019;m against podcasts. I think they&#x2019;re tedious and samey and sedative, and when I&#x2019;m feeling especially cranky, I consider them an enemy of music. Most podcasts are conversations for people to eavesdrop on &#x2014; recorded talk that precludes real-life talk about real life with zombie talk about podcasts. Also, I like music. With all of the world&#x2019;s unheard songs beckoning us with their endless mystery, why would anyone choose to waste their precious listening hours on a podcast?</p> </blockquote> <p>Yeah, the topic is a pretty polarizing one. Most vocal voices on online forums may not agree with the Chris&#x2019;s perspective. I myself believe this medium of entertainment or<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>infotainment&#x201D; needs some control to make it useful. As I had <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/podcasts-is-a-costly-medium-even-for-listeners">quipped earlier</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>I hate podcasts, because the medium is demanding. It demands so much time from me, demands focused attention to follow along. I wish I didn&#x2019;t find them so damn useful to keep giving in to the medium&#x2019;s demands.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yes, I have put some measures to not let podcasts be the static noise in my ears all the time&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;voices and perspective of others on everything. But the reason for that isn&#x2019;t that I do not like those voices. Or the fact that they don&#x2019;t<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>sound good&#x201D;, as Chris seems to argue.</p> <p>I disagree. On the contrary, I believe they sound <em>too</em> good, too polished for my liking. I feel the recent interest in the medium from all the big production/media houses has brought in a lot more investment and so the production chops. The medium does not need that. I tend to stay away from all these new shows.</p> <p>Anyway, for me, the reason that I put restriction on the amount of time I allow podcasts <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/on-podcasts-news-well-being">is simple</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>I have lately felt hindered by the time I am listening to the same repetitive thoughts from other people on podcasts. Experts talking about, dissecting, the tech news. Or blabbering about something I would not be interested in typically.</p> </blockquote> <p>I have realized the measure I had put in place to limit the medium has worked well for me. I listen to music more. I listen to the audiobooks more. Are they better at not<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>wasting&#x201D; one&#x2019;s time? Now that&#x2019;s purely subjective.</p>

			 <p>I read this note from Dave Winer on state of publishing on the open web. The first part reads like a fact.</p> <blockquote> <p>It&#x2019;s too hard to publish something to the open web. It has to be available as simple content. Not rendered inside a commercial template.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sure, I agree with this. Publishing on web is a need of time, every person with some access to the internet wishes to post his thoughts and pictures online. More often in closed groups&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;like Whatsapp, iMessage, Messenger etc. But then also on easily <em>accessible</em> and <em>free</em> services - like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc. Highlighted aspects are important.</p> <blockquote> <p>Technically it&#x2019;s a very simple problem, actually. And the raw serving capability is dirt cheap. But it needs a corporate entity to run it.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is those highlighted aspects that makes this a tricky problem. From the demand&#x2019;s perspective, those aspects are of a lot of importance. Majority of the people are neither ready to spend their energies nor their money for the ability to post online. Open web currently fails to address both at the same time. Accessible solutions aren&#x2019;t free. Free solutions aren&#x2019;t accessible.</p> <p>So the supply, mostly from the corporate entities, then caters to just those demands, bringing along the price for serving it.</p>

			 <p>There has been a lot of positive craze around Huawei <span class="small-caps">P30</span> Pro&#x2019;s cameras recently. For me it started with <a href="https://twitter.com/vladsavov/status/1111872621027774464" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Twitter thread</a> by Vlad Savov of The Verge where he compared images from this latest phone from Huawei against Pixel 3. Especially, the pitch dark, night-sight pictures. Just look at this specific example from the thread.</p> <p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pixel 3 without Night Sight<br />Pixel 3 with Night Sight<br />Huawei P30 Pro without regard for the laws of optics <a href="https://t.co/6WTpavqz9p">pic.twitter.com/6WTpavqz9p</a></p>&#x2014; Vlad Savov (@vladsavov) <a href="https://twitter.com/vladsavov/status/1112651674458472448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 1, 2019</a></blockquote> </p> <p>That&#x2019;s simply criminal. Here&#x2019;s Vlad summarizing his observation in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/1/18290215/huawei-p30-pro-camera-night-low-light-mode-photos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the article</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>In the following example, featuring an unlit bathroom where my eyes could detect shapes but no colors, the <span class="small-caps">P30</span> Pro does the unbelievable by actually focusing and producing a very respectable image.</p> </blockquote> <p>So now these mobile cameras can do better than our eyes? Nice. And this positive view towards the <span class="small-caps">P30</span> camera is shared by almost all tech reviewers. Here&#x2019;s what Engadget <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/29/huawei-p30-pro-camera-test-pixel-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says about this</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>With less light, zooming, focus and detail should be a struggle, but the <span class="small-caps">P30</span> Pro mostly shrugged it off. The combination of dual <span class="small-caps">OIS</span> on both the primary camera and the telephoto, in addition to the digital image stabilizing trick, gives the phone a better chance to capture images at reduced noise and do it all better.</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, this isn&#x2019;t the perfect smartphone - far from it. It isn&#x2019;t even the hands-down best camera quality and experience on a mobile phone. Rene Ritchie has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nmWHacg0YE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nice comparison video</a> of the phone with the iPhone <span class="small-caps">XS</span>. It is good to be aware of the capabilities and shortcoming of the overall device.</p> <p>But I am amazed at the speed with which the imaging technology on the smartphones are improving. It was only few months back when we were surprised looking at what the Pixel 3 could achieve with its night-sight feature. And we already have a device that, if not tops, matches that under most conditions.</p> <p>The tech pundits always made us believe that camera tech will be the next big differentiator for the smartphones&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;something that will separate the big, serious players from the emerging ones. However, the way things are going, I don&#x2019;t think that would be the case. The camera modules will again soon be commoditized and everyone would be back to the drawing board in search of that one differentiator.</p> <p>This does not bode well for Google&#x2019;s hardware efforts in smartphones. Apple and Samsung, for whom their brand is the primary selling point, would be pleased with this.</p>

			 <p>I read this wonderful quote by Charlie Chaplin today - I am going to use this leniently to keep the creative corner of my mind inspired.</p> <blockquote> <p>Imagination means nothing without doing.</p> </blockquote> <p>Such a small bunch of words, but oh-so-meaningful. I also came across <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/time-those-fleeting-moments-of">this post</a> that I had written <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/on-this-day">exactly a year back</a> on using the time we have at our hands well. Especially on why it is important not to stay focused on the things not done or done but in non-perfect way.</p> <blockquote> <p>(<em>Time that dawns</em>) with a promise to do so much more than there <em>is time</em> for. Till you realise those 24 hours the day dawned with? They just aren&#x2019;t enough. Not enough for everything. Barely enough for something.</p> <p>So you can either spend those fleeting moments on (<em>doing</em>) that something, anything. Or get bogged down with the burden of those others things left untouched. Because there&#x2019;s just not enough time.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is a good reminder for myself about something that I had realized some time back, but had forgotten recently. I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/1553401732886">did face a lull</a> in my reading and writing time recently. When I look back, I believe one of the reasons behind that was the fact that I was waiting for that right<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>space&#x201D; to work on my thoughts. One that never arrived. I need to stop waiting and spend more time <em>doing</em> stuff than to think whether the moment or the place or the environment or even the words are right. Andy Warhol has put it so perfectly.</p> <blockquote> <p>Don&#x2019;t think about making art, just get it done. Let everyone else decide if it&#x2019;s good or bad, whether they love it or hate it. While they are deciding, make even more art.</p> </blockquote>

			 <p>Today&#x2019;s Apple event was the first one where I have no opinion on. They showed many services that can potentially be great one day. But that day is not anytime soon. And I won&#x2019;t even be able to use some of them. Cynicism, though, will be pretty prevalent in the tech outlets.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2019/03/25/213000.html">Discussing Social Networks, Again</a></h1>

			 <p>Another week, another discussion on the state of social networks on TWiT network. This time it took place on the latest episode of <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-google" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This week in Google</a>&#xA0;. The discussion went on and on about how Google Plus was great. And how other social networks have ruined what made them the best in the first place&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;the posts from the real people and the social aspect around them&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;in their quest to monetize by jacking up the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>engagement&#x201D;.</p> <p>Such discussions happen very often these days. Eventually, they turn towards the alternatives that exists, but always take a long trodden path.</p> <blockquote> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Facebook is hated by everyone but is ubiquitous, too big. Twitter is loved by no one but stays relevant in discourse. IndieWeb is dull, abstruce. Federated services are great, but <em>no one</em> can get them working. Instagram&#x2019;s the lone messiah, but Mark&#x2019;s working hard to ruin it.&#x201D;</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, the original point on the available alternatives is all but left untouched. I am left frustrated every time by this sheer defeatism, this complete lack of attempt to try earnestly to understand and comment on the alternatives. What all alternatives have you tried? Were there none that were good? If so, why? What is missing? How can they be made better? What is it that you are looking for in a social network?</p> <p>Mike Elgan had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufr7O0qtX9U&amp;t=3251s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this comment</a> on the recent episode of TWiG.</p> <blockquote> <p>I would love a social network that had basically two rules. One is no algorithmic sorting or filtering, when I follow somebody I want everything they post. Second thing is I don&#x2019;t want to get any content that isn&#x2019;t the actual words or photos taken my the person I follow. No sharing, no retweeting.</p> </blockquote> <p>I thought great, <a href="https://micro.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I know of one</a> that meets these two rules. May be they will recommend it. Or comment on why it is lacking. Nah. Nothing. The topic ended there. I am perplexed at why Micro.blog isn&#x2019;t referenced more often during these discussions on social networks. Sure, it may not be perfect. So go ahead, criticize it. Tell the makers of the service why they can&#x2019;t use it. But do talk.</p> <p>And micro.blog isn&#x2019;t the only one. There&#x2019;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastodon</a>. And then there are the independent blogging solutions and <span class="small-caps">RSS</span>. Generate some buzz for them. You are not helping the situation by cribbing incessantly about the unending missteps of the existing services. Put these same old rants to rest now and crib about the new services. At least, the normal users would know there exist other alternatives and the developers would know what they need to work on.</p>

			 <p>I keep mentioning every time I get a chance that I am too picky while selecting the books I read. So it was fascinating to read few suggestions from Austin Kleon on <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2019/03/21/how-to-read-more-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to read more</a>. Especially his first tip - quit reading books you don&#x2019;t like</p> <blockquote> <p>It helps if you choose the right books in the first place. Stop reading what you think you <em>should</em> be reading and just read what you genuinely <em>want</em> to read.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yep, I follow this rule diligently. And I have my own list of<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>gems&#x201D; that just <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/21425016-amit?shelf=not-for-me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aren&#x2019;t for me</a>.</p> <p>I also keep my currently reading list loaded with multiple books at a time. Some are as audiobooks, some as e-books. (It&#x2019;s been very long since I read a paperback and it was primarily because <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/kindle-and-paperbacks/">I just don&#x2019;t enjoy them</a>.)</p> <blockquote> <p>Feel free to read promiscuously &#x2014; date 3 or 4 books at the same time until one makes you want to settle down with it.</p> </blockquote> <p>I do that, but not for the reason Austin mentions. I just like to hop between books at times. Many a times before I give up on one.</p> <p>I really liked these quotes that Austin has included in his post. Ah, I think I need to read a lot more.</p> <blockquote> <p>Nobody is going to get any points in heaven by slogging their way through a book they aren&#x2019;t enjoying but think they ought to read.</p> <p>&#x2014;Nancy Pearl</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>There is only one way to read, which is to browse in libraries and bookshops, picking up books that attract you, reading only those, dropping them when they bore you, skipping the parts that drag &#x2014; and never, never reading anything because you feel you ought, or because it is part of a trend or a movement. Remember that the book which bores you when you are twenty or thirty will open doors for you when you are forty or fifty &#x2014; and vice-versa. Don&#x2019;t read a book out of its right time for you.</p> <p>&#x2014;Doris Lessing, The Golden Notebook</p> </blockquote>

			 <p>I am currently on a break - I do not have any official work time as such. So this is an opportunity for rethinking things, declutter the stuff around the day-to-day life. I plan to identify what matters to me the most, what I enjoy doing the most. And then only sign-up for that. I have realized there is no point over-complicating too many things with <em>whys</em> and <em>hows</em>, and especially <em>why-nots</em>. It&#x2019;s better to just do the thing that my mind wants to do without fussing over the right moment or the perfect way. Neither ever arrive.</p> <p>So I will do anything that I <em>want</em> to do. But to that everything that I am not into, but my brain says I <em>should</em> do - nah. Not happening. This has already ruled some of the projects from my list, mostly dev ones, which I had signed up for just because everyone I come across was doing them. Or so I thought.</p> <p>Then there are those projects which I want to do, but just don&#x2019;t have an idea <em>yet</em> about how and when. One such project is my microcast Third-Person Voice. I am pulling it down. I enjoyed the experience, but I need to rethink whether it fits in my life currently.</p> <p>This signing up and sprinting in all directions had affected what I&#x2019;ve genuinely enjoyed for the longest time - reading and writing. The hope behind all this decluttering, this tidying up of mind space, is that I can focus again on just the stuff I want to do the most.</p>

It has been a wonderful learning experience.</p> <p>It was also an opportunity for myself to gain confidence. It kick-started my journey to more hobby projects, inspired me to even write more. Funny how few small beginnings can turn into significant projects.</p>

Every time I tour, I see loads and loads of people fighting for a spot, the same, crowded space that everyone around is taking pictures at. I have seen people put their backs to the most wonderful of the valleys and mountains and beaches just so that they would catch themselves and the serenity in the same picture. Doesn&#x2019;t matter then if it looks equally serene just few feet away from the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>instagrammable&#x201D; spot.</p> <blockquote> <p>Influencers who come into a community to get something, and who refuse to acknowledge or be curious about the people who make it up&#x2014;or, worse, who consider those people obstacles&#x2014;are refusing to participate in the best part of travel: Appreciating what, or who, makes a place different from any other.</p> </blockquote> <p>I could not say it better. All tourists need to respect the location and the people that dwell there. That picture-worthy spot you are on look out for is a home for many.</p>

			 <p>Recently David Merfield, the developer behind Blot, documented the steps to expose a <span class="small-caps">JSON</span> feed on a Blot site. I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/on-this-day-a-year-ago">have been running a <span class="small-caps">JSON</span> feed</a> for my blog for quite some time now, with some valuable help from David of course. It is this feed that drives the <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/on-this-day">On This Day</a> page on this blog. I thought I will share my approach so that others with a blog running on Blot can create such a page.</p> <p>To begin with, follow <a href="https://blot.im/developers/guides/json-feed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the guide</a> to get a working <span class="small-caps">JSON</span> feed for your blog. Validate you have a properly formed and accessible feed being served using the <a href="http://validator.jsonfeed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="small-caps">JSON</span> feed validator</a>.</p> <div class="note"> One key thing to understand here is how to create a view in Blot. It would be important to be aware of this step to proceed further. A view can be created in Blot by accessing the <a href="https://blot.im/settings/theme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">editing template</a> section (<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Template</strong>) in Blot dashboard. Click on <strong>Edit</strong> against your currently installed theme and search for an option<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span><strong>Create new view</strong><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span>. </div> <p>Once the <span class="small-caps">JSON</span> feed is available, create a view in Blot for a javascript file. Copy the complete content of the <a href="https://gist.github.com/am1t/5bcbc5366491c2b010adfe1358877899" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">javascript available as a gist</a><span class="marker">*</span> and add them to this new view. Modify the <code>json_feed_url</code> and <code>tz</code> variables appropriately to reflect the <span class="small-caps">URL</span> for the <span class="small-caps">JSON</span> feed and the timezone for your blog, you can refer to the formats in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="small-caps">TZ</span> database time zones</a>. This script does the following.</p> <ol type="1"> <li><strong>Fetches</strong> all the posts as <span class="small-caps">JSON</span> objects from the <span class="small-caps">JSON</span> feed</li> <li><strong>Identifies</strong> the posts that share the same date and month as the current date (but not the year to avoid loading today&#x2019;s posts)</li> <li><strong>Renders</strong> the posts (or <em>no posts</em> message) in the predefined section detailed below. This also includes some styling via the <code>.className</code> definition, you can remove/modify that as per your liking in fuction <code>renderPost</code>.</li> </ol> <p><underline>Make sure the above created view is accessible at a <span class="small-caps">URL</span>.</underline> If not, define a route in the <strong>Settings</strong> section of the view.</p> <p>Next, create another view for a page to display these posts; a reference html page is available <a href="https://gist.github.com/am1t/472499285986345f34c61274edd22cdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as a gist</a>. Modify the <code>src</code> in <code>&lt;script src=&quot;/flashback.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> to reflects the <span class="small-caps">URL</span> for the javascript created above. The script adds and renders the posts made on this day in earlier years in the <code>div</code> element with <code>id</code> <code>on-this-day</code>.</p> <p>Do give this a try, it is fascinating to see your thoughts change, or at times stay exactly the same, over the year. Reach out to me if you face any issues or find any step missing.</p> <div class="note"> <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Expose a <span class="small-caps">JSON</span> feed on your site. Create two views in Blot using the gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/am1t/5bcbc5366491c2b010adfe1358877899" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flashback.js</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/am1t/472499285986345f34c61274edd22cdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on-this-day.html</a>. You should have two additional pages, you can use the same file names. If you do, you can access your On This Day page at <code>/on-this-day</code>. </div> <hr /> <p><small><span class="marker">*</span> This javascript is inspired by and based on the wonderful project <a href="https://github.com/cleverdevil/micromemories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micro Memories</a> by <a href="https://cleverdevil.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan LaCour</a> for the micro.blog hosted blogs.

			 <p>I attempted to watch <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9495224/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</a> today. Netflix managed to solve a lot many technical challenges&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;it is a well-done interactive film. I think first of its kind. But boy, did it suck as a film. The format just did not click for me&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;the film worked neither as a science fiction nor as a horror.</p> <p>To be frank, I am a bit disappointed in this genre of films. There has been so much talk about these choose-your-own-adventure or multiple endings movies/shows. But I find the whole concept a bit distracting. Every time, I was made to choose any aspect playing on the screen, I was pulled out of the flow of the movie. I doubt this interactive form will work for many.</p> <p>Call me old school. But I want to be driven, I want to view the story from the director&#x2019;s perspective. I like to see what he or she wants to show me, keeping my mind completely open. I do not want to play a game while I am watching a movie. Because if I do want to, well, I will play a game in the first place.</p> <p>Sure, this was a good experiment to explore this concept of letting viewers drive the narrative of the film. And although I question its feasibility, I also believe this is just a start. There&#x2019;s soon going to be lot many such experiments with <span class="small-caps">VR</span> too. Whatever the makers believe, I am sure I would hate that form.</p> <p>I wish makers spend their efforts on the story, on the screenplay, on all the other aspects that make a movie brilliant. I will any day choose a linear, single ending drama or a thriller that a director has complete control over than a broken, nonsensical story that I can control every aspect of.</p>

La.&#x201D; or<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Bhai&#x201D; in the region I am from.</p> <p>Narrating the life of this towering personality is not a small feat given the sheer number of stream of art he was passionate about. He is a well-known and a well-respected person amongst Maharashtrians of all age. It is through his writing, through the careful study of human nature around him that he taught many what the real happiness is. So it is only just that I was so curious to learn more about this master, through especially the first of this two-part biopic that focuses on his early life.</p> <p>It was wonderful to know more about this simple person and was refreshing to see the Maharashtra of early 1900. In a way, I thought the people, the society that Bhai dwelt in was a lot more liberal, more open than what we see today. It was pleasing to watch the strong women with definite opinions, the simple marriage or even the relationship that Bhai&#x2019;s wife and his mother share. The finale with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWXbwSUxOW0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a mind-blowing rendition of Hindustani classical music</a> through a couple of well-known songs was sheer magic on screen - left me with goose bumps down my arms. It is Marathi culture on display. It instantly transported me back to my childhood days when these songs were our morning alarms. Boy, how much do I yearn for the simple life of yesteryears?</p> <p>No doubt then that it was a brilliant watch for me, and my family. Even my friends share my experience. But all of us already know a lot about the person and the people around him. The list of characters, from the real-life like Bhimsen Joshi or Kumar Gandarva and from Bhai&#x2019;s imagination like Anna or Namu Parit, that walk the screen are well itched in us Marathi people&#x2019;s memories. But that may not be the case for people not from this state.</p> <p>I wish this movie was an equally well-made biography, not just a celebration of the life of this beloved man. I wish the characters were allowed to grow, introduced at the very least. I wish we learned more about the relationship Bhai shared with these characters. I wish this could have been that one movie I would recommend every friend of mine to watch so that they knew what gem of a person Pu. La. was. But, alas.</p> <p>First thing I did once I was back from the theater was to listen to couple of Pu. La.&#x2019;s story-telling acts. It was heart-warming for me to see many aged couples who could barely walk taking all the effort to come down to the theater with their family and laughing their hearts out. May be they had spent their golden years together watching Bhai live and now they want to re-live those days. So yes, the movie did leave many, including me, nostalgic. May be that was the win the makers were going for.</p>

			 <p>Derek Sivers wrote a wonderful piece on the benefits he has realized via his diaries and journals. He talks about why he likes keeping his daily diary.</p> <blockquote> <p>We so often make big decisions in life based on predictions of how we think we&#x2019;ll feel in the future, or what we&#x2019;ll want. Your past self is your best indicator of how you actually felt in similar situations. So it helps to have an accurate picture of your past.</p> </blockquote> <p>It was especially fascinating looking at the list of topics he keeps a journal about. A great, great inspiration for any one looking out for what to journal about. He puts down a prime example.</p> <blockquote> <p>I especially like my<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Regrets&#x201D; journal. Whenever I do something I regret, I write it down there, noting why I regret it, what I wish I would have done instead, and how I hope to prevent this in the future.</p> </blockquote> <p>Derek has given me so much to ponder on. I have bookmarked this, I may reference this every time I question my resolve to journal more. Even outside of a journal, I think this is a great suggestion to write everything.</p> <blockquote> <p>Ask yourself questions, then question your answers.</p> </blockquote> <p>To be frank, it was when I read his account that I got to know that diary and journal are not the same. Apparently, diary is for an account of one&#x2019;s daily activities while journal is for more comprehensive thoughts on specific topics. Some may say that&#x2019;s minutiae, but it&#x2019;s good to know.</p>

			 <p>Around a year ago, I got enthralled by the IndieWeb principles and started experimenting with them on my website. <em>Exactly</em> a year ago today, I had started contributing on the Micro.blog platform. And it has been a very productive year writing-wise since then.</p> <p>I have expressed myself a lot more in the past year. I have thought a lot clearer, a lot better as a result. It is all thanks to the wonderful interactions on the platform.</p> <p>What it also means is that I have a year worth of posts to look back upon. And I thought what better way to do so than getting the <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/on-this-day">On This Day page</a> added to my blog. I have done that. It presents how the journey started - if nothing else I myself can follow the thoughts along as they evolved.</p> <p>Will it stick in this same form? May be not. I may experiment a bit on how I see this feature. But I have got the base working now for my blot-based blog.</p> <p><strong><span class="small-caps">PS</span></strong>: This feature is based on the wonderful project <a href="https://github.com/cleverdevil/micromemories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micro Memories</a> by <a href="https://cleverdevil.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan LaCour</a> for the micro.blog hosted blogs.

			 <p>I recently came across the <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/1/16/18185256/10-year-challenge-facebook-meme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#10YearChallenge</a> that was all the rage among the netizens. And, as is often the case with the memes on social media, it made no sense to me at all. Of course, how you look would change drastically over the decade. What&#x2019;s so special about that?</p> <p>But as he very often does, Sameer Vasta caught the spirit of the challenge perfectly. He <a href="https://www.inthemargins.ca/10yearchallenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted an account</a> of how his life and the world around has changed in the last decade. It&#x2019;s a must read (and while you are there, may be you should also subscribe to his wonderful blog). His post inspired me to <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/tagged/retrospection">#retrospect</a> on how the last decade has been for me.</p> <p>I hit my archives right away to see what I was thinking about, was writing about a decade ago. I was in my early to mid twenties then and I had a guess I was busy being a crazy teen. I noticed I was writing my heart out, not thinking too seriously about anything. I wrote very poorly, but at the same time, freely. The immaturity in my thoughts and in my reading of the events around is pretty apparent in the posts.</p> <p>However, I also came across <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/archive/what-is-ambition/">this post about ambitions</a> that I wrote in January of 2009. This observation of mine caught my attention (I couldn&#x2019;t stop myself from fixing the prose to some extent).</p> <blockquote> <p>If an ardent desire is what an ambition is all about, then yes, I must have had hundreds of ambitions by now. And the list has possibly grown to a thousands now with passing age. With each ambition I achieve, I have added a few more in the list. I know and still remember the whole gyan that a life lived without an ambition is like an arrow fired without an aim. But practically speaking, I feel it is impossible to lay the path for one&#x2019;s whole life right at his or her birth.</p> </blockquote> <p>It doesn&#x2019;t matter how immature I sounded in most of the posts, one thing I appreciate about the decade-younger me was how free he was. He had a lot more to say and often said it in a manner that even the older, supposedly more mature me can&#x2019;t disagree with.</p> <p>I have held a lot of ardent desires, ambitions - some that have been fulfilled, many that haven&#x2019;t been yet. But deep within, I had hoped that I will someday live a calm, peaceful life. Live amongst my loved ones. Gain respect in society, among colleagues, friends and acquaintances.</p> <p>As I reflect today on an important decade gone by, I realize I have managed to work towards that ambition through many tricky, life-altering decisions. I am closer to my loved ones than I was a decade ago. I have married the love of my life. We are blessed with a lovely daughter who has become the center of our universe. Professionally, I have better clarity on where I want to be. I have found a circle of friends I can rely on during times of stress.</p> <p>Sure the world around looks to be in shambles. There&#x2019;s a definite lack of trust for the democratic structures, lack of trust between one another. The past few years have heightened the noise in our lives. No wonder then, people are losing faith. So it is tempting to give up to the pessimism around and stay grumpy.</p> <p>But I also realized it was healthier to reflect inwards and seek optimism by working on things I can control. So, the fidgety teen from 10 years back has given way to the calmer, saner, thoughtful self of today. I feel content within and that is the most important thing.</p> <p>Satisfaction. Yes, even the #10Year younger me would have, with pleasure, chosen that as an ambition.</p>

			 <p>Martin Weigert talks pretty openly about his love for emails.</p> <blockquote> <p>Over the years, one frequent type of blog post published by tech heavyweights laments their struggle with managing their emails, often ending in death wishes for this technology.</p> <p>I however want email to live, to thrive, and to be eternal. Not only because I publish weekly email newsletters (ok, that makes me biased), but also because email offers a huge benefit to every person on this planet with a comparatively little downside for them individually and for society at large.</p> </blockquote> <p>A couple of points we just can&#x2019;t overlook while talking about emails.</p> <ul> <li>They have wasted (and continue to do so) countless productive hours cumulatively of the human race.</li> <li>It remains the only open form that is not walled by any one company&#x2019;s interests; a form that allows communication that is cross-platform, irrespective of who the sender and receivers are and what service or tool they use.</li> </ul> <p>Do I love email? Nope. However, do I hate email, wish death for the form of communication? Absolutely, positively not.</p>

			 <p>I have <em>finally</em> given up on the hope that Apple will fix their Macbook lineup and have decided to switch to Windows. It was a long time coming, and the decision wasn&#x2019;t an easy one. But what Apple offers, especially in Indian market, isn&#x2019;t worth the price. The lineup from its competitors doesn&#x2019;t allow them and their users to justify their crazy costs. They need a cheaper, better alternative to compete. They needed to replace Air, not launch a new range. They have now failed to do it for 3 years. And I can wait no longer.</p> <p>Will Apple&#x2019;s devices be more durable? Sure. Does it justify to pay, for an entry-level Air, twice the cost of a fully loaded Dell? Absolutely not.</p> <p>So I have got a Dell now. I am not really worried about the switch to Windows 10&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;I do use it in office. I had also analysed my software usage, and except for Markdown writers, there&#x2019;s nothing software-wise that I will miss. My primary need, other than writing, is coding and Microsoft has me covered with <span class="small-caps">VS</span> Code and <span class="small-caps">WSL</span>. Sure, I <em>will</em> miss Terminal, but I think I will manage without it.</p> <p>I am, however, a bit worried about the out-of-box experience, given OEMs are known for screwing Microsoft up with their customisations. Not sure if there are any must-dos and must-haves on a new Windows device. I will look out for any input I can gather. Overall, I guess I would do fine.</p> <p>Of course, I will hold my judgement till I use the device regularly and extensively. My current Macbook Pro has served me well. I wish Apple hadn&#x2019;t forced me with their utter lack of inclination to improve their entry-level offerings. They won&#x2019;t grow into developing markets unless they stop selling the same old story.</p>

			 <p>Irrespective of what the popular belief is, the need for social networks is not going away &#x2014; more so amongst those who are not technology oriented. Sure, some particular services that exist today may die down. But the medium won&#x2019;t.</p> <p>Just look at <a href="http://scalar.usc.edu/works/everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-social-media-but-were-too-afraid-to-ask/history-and-different-types-of-social-media" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the history of the social media</a> structures on the Internet. There has always existed a network of some form where every person that was connected could hang out. The initial users that adopted the digital life were techies, so their solutions were comparatively tech-savvy. I remember I have spent hours discussing and debating with my friends on <span class="small-caps">IRC</span> channels and on email groups and on XMPP-based <span class="small-caps">IM</span> clients.</p> <p>I believe even in the world where not everybody and everything was connected, there existed mediums to communicate, to interact, to share. They might have been analog, or of forms that needed one to be in the presence of others. But they existed nonetheless.</p> <p>In today&#x2019;s age of smartphones, it&#x2019;s become a lot simpler to get online and be<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>connected&#x201D; with others. As a result, there are more people, more <em>common</em> non-techies, who are always <a href="https://wersm.com/the-10-top-reasons-why-we-use-social-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the look out</a> for simpler ways to share their thoughts once they get online and stay in touch with others. They will sign-up with any service that promises them that. And they did.</p> <p>Sure, the proponents of the open internet, myself included, dislike the current social networking behemoths - Facebook, and Twitter. But I think it is important to not let the disdain for these specific platforms turn into a complete rejection of the medium itself. There will always exist some structure that can facilitate communication in the form of text, images and other share-worthy stuff. The state became dire when we let a set of private entities wall this structure in their silos.</p> <p>No doubt, Facebook and Twitter are in decline today. But the terrible scenario can recur if the common, but rising set of connected users is not provided with more open, more interoperable alternatives that are equally engaging and simple to use. And do so before other silos take over the medium again.</p> <p>I know of the services that already meet the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>open and interoperable&#x201D; characteristic. But the majority contenders reek of<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>by-the-techies-for-the-techies&#x201D; fervour. So there&#x2019;s still a long way to go to meet the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>engaging and simple&#x201D; part&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;the one closest is <a href="https://micro.blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micro.blog</a>. I believe there exists a <a href="https://indieweb.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">group of brilliant minds</a> that understands the importance of addressing this. It is incumbent upon this group to work towards that.</p>

			 <p>I have recently been thinking a lot about making it easier for people to interact on my posts. The commenting systems of yesteryears served well till they were completely ruined by spams and unnecessary hurdles around setting them up and managing them.</p> <p>Since I embraced the IndieWeb, I realised that <a href="https://indieweb.org/webmention" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webmentions</a> can potentially address this need. One primary reason that I believe they can fare better than the existing commenting system is the required skills barrier to get started.</p> <p>But I was afraid that the same barrier to<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>entry&#x201D; would also mean not everyone could comment on my posts. It could potentially limit the audience, especially one that interacts, to the developer niche that understands IndieWeb. But I was pleased that wasn&#x2019;t the case. More on <em>why</em> later, first a quick comment on comments.</p> <p>I am not alone who is fed up of the commenting systems. <a href="http://scripting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Winer</a> has since long turned off the responses on his posts. And in recent times he also has been particularly <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/02/141534.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unhappy with Disqus</a>, his selected replacement to the in-built responses. So, he <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/31/155551.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found out his way</a> to enable a commenting mechanism that did not need constant managing. Plus at the same time, had an entry barrier of sorts. He now <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/31/155551.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uses Twitter reposts</a> for comments.</p> <blockquote> <p>Use the <i class="fa fa-retweet"></i> [retweet] feature here on Scripting News more. It&#x2019;s a way to comment on what&#x2019;s going on here, without using Disqus.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sure, it meets the need. You need not manage a separate commenting system. You can follow tweets <em>on Twitter</em> - they are closer to post <em>on Twitter</em>. And Dave publishes <span class="small-caps">RSS</span> feed of all the comments. So he, and the readers, can receive all the comments.</p> <p>For me personally though, this does not meet the one main criteria - it keeps the responses away from the posts, hence from the context. And inadvertently from the readers too. There&#x2019;s no way then to inspire any inclination amongst readers to contribute and be part of an ongoing conversation on the post.</p> <p>So, back to webmentions. I can display mentions along with my post (and with <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/display-webmentions/">this recent guide</a> I had written, you can too) and that means any reader at my blog is aware of the sort of discussion that&#x2019;s taking place over the post. If you see my recent posts, they have significant interactions between multiple people.</p> <p>But where is this discussion taking place? And how can one be part of it? It&#x2019;s primarily all happening on <a href="https://micro.blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">micro.blog</a>. The platform fosters a pleasant community of many creative and open minds. It also encourages meaningful conversations over mindless reactions. And Manton, the mind behind Micro.blog, is a <a href="https://manton.org/2018/09/07/the-way-out.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">firm proponent of the open web</a>.</p> <p>I wish more people become part of the platform - better, support the platform by subscribing to the paid plans. And one of the ways I thought I can advertise the platform and bring it to the attention of many is by prominently displaying it along with posts. So, now for every posts on this blog with conversations at micro.blog, there will be a clear<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Discuss on Micro.blog&#x201D; link that takes you directly to the conversation thread (<a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/1546473053307">example</a>).<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>You want to comment? Please join Micro.blog.&#x201D;</p> <p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2020/5125b5c51a.jpg" alt="Discuss on M.b"></p> <p>That would, in addition, be a nudge to post a longer response on one&#x2019;s own website.</p> <p>My hope is this will exhibit the biggest asset of the micro.blog platform, it&#x2019;s community, in context and as a result, inspire more people to join with a ready-to-access link to the place where the conversation is taking place. If a significant section of the platform users, one that can, starts to display the conversations (webmentions) and starts to include such links, we should soon have an extremely diverse set of users joining the platform.</p>

			 <p>2018, for me, was a year of many firsts. To be frank, I was uncharacteristically active overall&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;so much so that I startled myself at multiple times throughout the year with the liveliness. I possessed heaps of clarity in terms of what I was working on, both within and outside of the profession.</p> <p>Sure, if I look outward, 2018 has left the world in complete disarray. There is chaos, unclarity all around. There is an inconspicuous tension building up in every part of the world. A lack of trust, faith in one another. In humanity.</p> <p>2018 may very well be remembered as the year when the word<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>true&#x201D; lost all its meaning. A fight to drum up the perception that my truth is the <em>only</em> truth made one insensitive of everything that was being said by anyone.</p> <p>And it did get tiring. As Scaachi Koul <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/scaachikoul/2018-year-end-exhaustion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rightly said</a>,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>2018 wore us all the hell out&#x201D; (h/t <a href="https://www.inthemargins.ca/micro-6978c72c-3df7-4555-a4e2-de3505877819" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sameer Vasta</a>). I empathise with her when she says</p> <blockquote> <p>I am usually energized by arguing, by getting aggressive, by putting a name or a face to an enemy, online or otherwise. Not this year.</p> </blockquote> <p>But then I have decided to remember 2018 for the goods it brought me personally.</p> <p>I expressed. Kept churning up more longer posts and lots and lots of shorter microposts.</p> <p>I captured. Snapped a significant part of my life as pictures. Posted them, shared them more.</p> <p>I learnt. Understood. And got enamoured by IndieWeb.</p> <p>I developed. Worked on so many <a href="http://github.com/am1t/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new projects</a> - many found useful even by few others.</p> <p>I experimented. Recorded <a href="https://monday.micro.blog/2018/10/01/episode-amit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a first podcast episode</a>. Started <a href="http://voice.amitgawande.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new individual podcast</a>.</p> <p>Unlike me, I gave up a lot lesser in 2018. Almost everything I noticed above was taken to completion.</p> <p>And most importantly, I lived. Quality time with people closest to me. Family reunions. Getaways. Holidays. Making new friends, in real and digital life.</p> <p>Yep. I will remember 2018 as a year of being satisfied. And being alive. It is only fair to welcome 2019 with a clean, untidy slate.</p>

			 <p>I have been using <a href="https://blot.im" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blot</a>, a simple blogging platform with no interface, for quite some time now for running my blog. I am not alone when I say this, but am mighty impressed with how simple it is to post things on blot and maintain the overall site. They are just some files in Dropbox - that’s about it. So, it was pretty straightforward to <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/theme-refresh">customise the theme</a> to my liking and to <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/indiewebify-blot-site">enable the support for IndieWeb principles</a>.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2020/427a86b0a6.jpg" alt="Post Notes"> 
<p>One thing I have noticed, though, is that most of the IndieWeb principles are not visible. They enable a more open web, providing sites a grammar they can talk to one another with. But for someone who owns the website or even someone who reads the posts on a website, whatever changes go in just aren’t apparent. Except, of course, for webmentions.</p>
<p>I have already detailed <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/indiewebify-hugo-website/">the steps to Indiewebify one’s website</a> (specifically one built with Hugo). I did not go into the details of setting up webmentions. And that is exactly what I get asked the most about - how does one display mentions along with the posts.</p>
<p>The need is more evident with microblogging - and especially so with <a href="https://micro.blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">micro.blog</a>. The platform fosters a very active and pleasant community focused more on the interactions (replies) than meaningless reactions (likes, reposts). It also sends webmentions for every reply to a post to the sites that can receive them. So the desire to display the interactions along with the posts, microposts more so, is understandable.</p>
<p>In this post, I will (finally!) document the steps that can help one receive, fetch and display the webmentions along with the posts. The steps are documented from a reference of a blot website. However, the steps below can be altered at appropriate places, primarily formats, to implement the support for any other platform.</p>
<h2 id="essential-indieweb">Essential Indieweb</h2>
<p>Before you can start receiving the webmentions at your site, there is an essential step from IndieWeb to be achieved - to make your website your identity online. It involves declaring openly your social network profiles as <code>rel-me</code> links and link those profiles back to your site. This allows you to login to any IndieAuth enabled services using your website’s homepage - no need to create an account or maintain passwords.</p>
<p>To achieve this, modify the <code>head.html</code> of the site’s theme to add such links to your other online profiles in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element. These profiles can be on Twitter, Github, Facebook, or even email - anything where you can link back to your website from. Some reference links are shown below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">link</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">rel</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;me&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://twitter.com/abcxyz&#34;</span> /&gt;
&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">link</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">rel</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;me&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;http://github.com/abcxyz&#34;</span> /&gt;
&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">link</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">rel</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;me&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;mailto:abcxyz@example.com&#34;</span> /&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>After you declare your website with either Twitter or Github, they can authenticate your identity. With email, a link is sent to the configured email address to do the same, very much like any email-based two-factor authentication.</p>
<p>You also need to declare the service which will act as an authorization endpoint when needed. This is used by other services, mostly IndieAuth clients, to validate your identity. To configure this, just add the below link to your site’s head.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">link</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">rel</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;authorization_endpoint&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://indieauth.com/auth&#34;</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Once you have this enabled, you can test your setup using <a href="https://indiewebify.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indiewebify.Me</a>. Test the &ldquo;Set up Web Sign In&rdquo; section.</p>
<p>You are now ready to receive the webmentions from other sites, including Micro.blog.</p>
<h2 id="receive-webmentions">Receive Webmentions</h2>
<p>This primarily involves hosting and declaring a webmention endpoint. Of course, the active IndieWeb community already has a ready solution for this - <a href="https://webmention.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webmention.io</a> by <a href="https://aaronparecki.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aaron Parecki</a>. It is &ldquo;a hosted service created to easily handle webmentions&rdquo;. All you have to do is sign-in with your domain (i.e. validate your identity) and let Webmention.io receive all mentions to your site. Once that’s done, just declare the webmention endpoint as below in your site’s <code>head</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">link</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">rel</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;webmention&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://webmention.io/username/webmention&#34;</span> /&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>username</code> is typically the url of your site (you can also find these details on the <a href="https://webmention.io/settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">settings</a> page). To test this setup, login to <a href="https://webmention.io/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webmentions.io dashboard</a> and you should start seeing the mentions sent to your site (which includes the replies on Micro.blog.</p>
<h2 id="display-webmentions">Display Webmentions</h2>
<p>Webmention.io also <a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io#api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">provides APIs</a> for you to fetch the webmentions to your posts/site. You can implement a custom solution using Javascript for fetching and displaying these mentions along with posts. Below is one of the ways this can be achieved. It specifically pulls the likes, reposts and replies and puts them below the posts. The code might look a bit untidy, but it would be easier to follow what’s going on. You can improve over this eventually.</p>
<p>To start with, declare a placeholder for the webmentions. Place the below <code>div</code> element in your <code>entry.html</code> file between <code>{{#entry}}</code> and <code>{{/entry}}</code> - preferably towards the end of the file, just above <code>{{/entry}}</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">div</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;post-mentions&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">id</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;post-mentions&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">style</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;display:none&#34;</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">ul</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;mentions-list&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">id</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;mentions-list&#34;</span>&gt;
  &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">ul</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">div</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Of course, you could replace the unordered list <code>ul</code> element with anything else. This is just one of the ways you can do it.</p>
<p>Next, you need to fill this <code>div</code> element with the mentions the entry has received. You can use the javascript snippet available at <a href="https://gist.github.com/am1t/7295b4eaf101372ea71c877cfd8be694" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this gist</a> to fetch and display the webmentions along with the post. Just place the complete code available there at the end of <code>script.js</code> file of your blot’s theme. So it would look something like below (note that this is an incomplete snapshot).</p>

<h2 id="interactions-from-social-media">Interactions from Social Media</h2>
<p>Though references to your posts from IndieWeb sites are handled, what about the references made on Twitter or Facebook? It can be in any form of response (i.e. likes/retweets/reposts) to the syndicated post. Of course, they do not send webmentions (wish they did).</p> <p>One option is to implement your own <a href="https://indieweb.org/backfeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backfeed</a> to poll for such interactions and handle them as response. Well, the community has made sure there is a simpler hosted option. Enter <a href="https://brid.gy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bridgy</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bridgy is an open source project and proxy that implements backfeed and <span class="small-caps">POSSE</span> as a service. Bridgy sends webmentions for comments, likes, etc. on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, and Flickr.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just connect your social accounts with your website at Bridgy and every time there is an interaction about your post on a service, Bridgy captures that and sends a webmention to your endpoint configured earlier.</p>
<hr>
<p>I understand that the IndieWeb journey can get overwhelming. Webmentions are a critical part of this journey and, as I said earlier, one of the more prominent pieces of the overall puzzle. I have never been comfortable using any of the commenting systems, be it those that come native with the CMSes or external commenting systems like Disqus. I have also observed that the new platforms, like Blot or Micro.blog, rarely come bundled with commenting systems of their own.</p>
<p>Webmention has a potential to address that need. I hope the steps detailed above come in handy for anyone who wants to display webmentions on his or her site right next to the posts. The source for the theme that styles <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/">my blog</a> at Blot is <a href="https://github.com/am1t/blot-musings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">openly available at GitHub</a>. So, if you like anything that you see at my blog, you can refer to the source and get inspired.</p>
<p>Do let me know if you face issues with getting any of steps carried out. If you don’t face any issue and get everything working perfectly, send me a webmention — the best way would be to link to this post. If all’s well, your links would be visible below this post as mentions.</p>

			 <p>This is such fascinating write up by Sinclair Target on history behind the challenges <span class="small-caps">RSS</span> has faced over the years. And also why it just never managed to succeed&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;even though it had the backing of all the major publishers, at least everyone adopted and served it.</p> <blockquote> <p>Today, <span class="small-caps">RSS</span> is not dead. But neither is it anywhere near as popular as it once was. Lots of people have offered explanations for why <span class="small-caps">RSS</span> lost its broad appeal. Perhaps the most persuasive explanation is exactly the one offered by Gillmor in 2009. Social networks, just like <span class="small-caps">RSS</span>, provide a feed featuring all the latest news on the internet. Social networks took over from <span class="small-caps">RSS</span> because they were simply better feeds. They also provide more benefits to the companies that own them.</p> </blockquote> <p><span class="small-caps">RSS</span> isn&#x2019;t dead, yet. It still serves all the podcasts feeds, and there are a large number of users, including me, for whom it is the only source of any timeline of sort. But the fact cannot be denied that it does not draw any attention from big technology companies. With <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1477667#c0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox too recently dropping the built-in feed support</a>, it became clear everyone wants the standard to exists but no one wants to work on improving and maintaining it. Wish it did not stagnate.</p> <blockquote> <p><span class="small-caps">RSS</span> might have been able to overcome some of these limitations if it had been further developed. Maybe <span class="small-caps">RSS</span> could have been extended somehow so that friends subscribed to the same channel could syndicate their thoughts about an article to each other. Maybe browser support could have been improved. But whereas a company like Facebook was able to<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>move fast and break things,&#x201D; the <span class="small-caps">RSS</span> developer community was stuck trying to achieve consensus. When they failed to agree on a single standard, effort that could have gone into improving <span class="small-caps">RSS</span> was instead squandered on duplicating work that had already been done.</p> </blockquote> <p>I believe that is <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the story of how standards proliferate</a>. But I just hope more people realize the importance of the <span class="small-caps">RSS</span> standard for the existence of open web and work on evangelizing and advance it.</p> <p>If we stay dependent on technology companies to back it, we will always end-up with siloed timelines. For them, achieving consensus and coexisting with other players is costlier. It is cheaper to foster user engagement in a walled platforms controlled centrally by the owners. Companies will always go with the cheaper options.</p>

			 <p>This is such a fascinating read &#x2014; so detailed on how Andrey Sitnik planned for and went through this arduous experiment.</p> <blockquote> <p>Then I asked myself if<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&#x2018;</span>technological fasting&#x2019; could do one good in modern society. Technology has changed the world in the blink of an eye, leaving us no time to reflect on it. What if a month without modern technology could<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&#x2018;</span>travel&#x2019; you to the past? What if there is a way you could compare your technology-relying self to what you once were?</p> </blockquote> <p>It is really curious to read how the analogue tools &#x2014; for his camera, his watch, a map, a compass and of course a notepad and a pen - were key in taking him through. Of course, it needs planning to keep your brain busy without a stream of digital updates and reads to chomp on. To keep feeding it with activities.</p> <blockquote> <p>Boredom was the thing that scared me the most, so I did a lot of preparation: took a few thick books, drew up a schedule (when I leave one place for another) and made up several evening rituals to follow every day. The internet-less reality turned out to be a boredom-less one, too. Recreation does not require anything special&#x2014;in the end, you can always go out and hunt for good photos.</p> </blockquote> <p>I wish I could undertake such an abstinence from the technology around me. Not because I hate my current state (doesn&#x2019;t mean I do not even). But because I wish I too could arrive at a conclusion very similar to Andrey&#x2019;s.</p> <blockquote> <p>I came to the conclusion that <span class="small-caps">IT</span> hadn&#x2019;t changed the world around, but created another, a parallel one. The reason we are always nervous and never have enough time is that we are living two lives now. It&#x2019;s without a doubt difficult, yet how interesting it is to be living two times as much!</p> </blockquote> <p>Do read this &#x2014; even though we know most deep down the ills of our constant connectedness, it is eye-opening to read someone record his experiences. If possible, we should take Andrey&#x2019;s advice. I, for sure, am seriously considering it.</p> <blockquote> <p>I would not recommend digital fasting to everyone, but a temporary abstinence of some sort seems a very right thing to do</p> </blockquote>

And because Twitter doesn&#x2019;t allow for editing tweets, information that goes viral via retweets is also more likely to be false or exaggerated. According to <span class="small-caps">MIT</span> research published in the journal Science, Twitter users retweet fake news almost twice as much as real news. Other Twitter users, desperate for validation, endlessly retweet their own tweets, spamming followers with duplicate information.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is exactly the reason Twitter needs to eliminate retweet feature first&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;a lot before their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18037458/twitter-like-button-jack-dorsey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proposed killing of the like button</a>.

			 <blockquote> <p>But what is true today is that not all Chinese phone software is bad. And when it is bad from a Western perspective, it&#x2019;s often bad for very different reasons than the bad Android skins of the past. Yes, many of these phones make similar mistakes with overbearing <span class="small-caps">UI</span> decisions &#x2014; hello, Huawei &#x2014; and yes, it&#x2019;s easy to mock some designs for their obvious thrall to iOS. But these are phones created in a very different context to Android devices as we&#x2019;ve previously understood them.</p> <p>The Chinese phone market is a spiraling behemoth of innovation and audacity, unlike anything we&#x2019;ve ever seen. If you want to be on board with the already exciting hardware, it&#x2019;s worth trying to understand the software.</p> </blockquote> <p>What Chinese smartphones offer is the feature parity in hardware with high-end devices from well-known brands, like Apple, Samsung, at a price which is affordable to the mainstream market. It is difficult to convince someone to buy an iPhone when all the devices are presented along with their specs. Doesn&#x2019;t matter then if the software experience is ripped off.</p> <p>What I feel is troubling though and a thing that gets neglected is the durability of these devices. The maximum life of these is what the warranty is - typically an year. Most often, these devices start failing at performance or battery or overall system level even before it hits that period. And when it does, there always are new cheaper devices to replace them with.</p> <p>This will never get covered by reviews &#x2014; because reviewers move on to the new, shiny devices in a week or two. It&#x2019;s the mainstream that suffers. However, brands that overcome this behaviour outlive ones that fade away sooner.</p>

			 <p>This is not a post where I be a tech pundit, read tea leaves scattered all over the internet and predict what Apple is going to launch on the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upcoming October Apple event</a>. Nope. These are the things I wish Apple launches. Some because I need them now. Some because I would eventually need them.</p> <ol type="1"> <li><strong>Non-TouchBar Macbook Pro:</strong> I need this, my old <span class="small-caps">MBP</span> is crying out loud at this point. It needs to be replaced. I wish Apple updates this version with new keyboards.</li> <li><strong>Macbook Air:</strong> If my first wish is not granted or is granted, but does not solve the keyboard problem, I will go with an Air. Current Air is a mockery with that dated screen and processor and the tiny storage. Just update those, keep everything the same. Don&#x2019;t touch that keyboard (<em>no pun intended</em>). And <strong>don&#x2019;t make Macbook One the new Air</strong> in its current form&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;one port is not enough.</li> <li><strong>Non-Pro iMac:</strong> If you can give me a laptop, give me the updated iMac. Again, change nothing big. Just update the processor and if possible, get rid of that 5400rpm hard drive. Just make Fusion drive the default.</li> <li><strong>Mac Mini:</strong> You know there is that tiny device being sold on that tiny corner of your website right? Yeah that, update that. I would love to have it run some side projects.</li> <li><strong>iOS changes for iPad:</strong> I know you will refresh iPad Pros. But in the current form, the iOS platform seems underwhelming on these loaded iPad devices. Make it do more. To start with, get rid of that static-grid springboard.</li> </ol> <p>I wish Apple goes crazy a bit. It is ok to be doing the stuff thoughtfully, making things that work well. That sell well. But at times, it is also important to stop being<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>boring&#x201D; and do more stuff that you don&#x2019;t know how people will react to. Things like Pencil. Or AirPods. Or even Surface Studio from Microsoft.</p>

			 <p>It&#x2019;s time for Apple product launches. And so is the time for all the talks of <em>-gates</em> and <em>sheeples</em> and <em>reality distortion</em>. There&#x2019;s so much noise this time with iPhone <span class="small-caps">XR</span> screens. Typical comments from most folks.</p> <ul> <li><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>..just 326 ppl in 2018? WTF?&#x201D;</li> <li><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>..not even 1080p screen? How will it play 1080p videos?&#x201D;</li> </ul> <p>I get it, both are facts. iPhone <span class="small-caps">XR</span> is not a full-HD screen and has a pixel density way lower than it&#x2019;s better sibling <span class="small-caps">XS</span>. But does it deserve all the brickbats? Am not sure about that. This is the screen configurations of all the lowest configuration iPhones over the year (since Retina displays were introduced).</p> <table> <thead> <tr class="header"> <th style="text-align: left;">Model</th> <th style="text-align: left;">Resolution (<span class="small-caps">PPI</span>)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr class="odd"> <td style="text-align: left;">iPhone 4, 4s</td> <td style="text-align: left;">960x640 (326 ppi)</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td style="text-align: left;">iPhone 5, 5c, 5s</td> <td style="text-align: left;">1136x640 (326 ppi)</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td style="text-align: left;">iPhone 6, 6s</td> <td style="text-align: left;">1334x750 (326 ppi)</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td style="text-align: left;">iPhone 7, 7s</td> <td style="text-align: left;">1334x750 (326 ppi)</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td style="text-align: left;">iPhone 8</td> <td style="text-align: left;">1334x750 (326 ppi)</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td style="text-align: left;">iPhone <span class="small-caps">XR</span></td> <td style="text-align: left;">1792x828 (326 ppi)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>I hope one can get the trend with this. Since the time retina screens were launched, pixel density of lowest configuration iPhone has always been 326ppi. And iPhone <span class="small-caps">XR</span> is that device this year. So it gets that screen. Sure, Apple always has a Plus size device with a better resolution screens. That need is addressed by <span class="small-caps">XS</span> this year.</p> <p>So am not sure why there is such a huge pushback on <span class="small-caps">XR</span> devices. If reviews are anything to go by, these screens are just as good as Apple&#x2019;s <span class="small-caps">LCD</span> screens have ever been. Are there cheaper Android devices that have screens with better resolutions? Of course. There will always exists cheaper devices with better configuration on paper than iPhone. But I think one thing tech nerds should have learnt by now, Apple never plays the configuration game.</p>

			 <p>I have lately felt hindered by the time I am listening to the same repetitive thoughts from other people on podcasts. Experts talking about, dissecting, the tech news. Or blabbering about something I would not be interested in typically.</p> <p>I realised it had become a problem when these podcasts kept playing as static noise in the background&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;irrespective of whether I was working or driving or eating breakfast. In that sense, I agree with <a href="http://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/dialing-down" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="small-caps">CGP</span> Grey&#x2019;s thoughts</a> on podcasts as he dialled down his consumption on the internet.</p> <blockquote> <p>But podcasts have taken too much ground in my mind: any moment of idleness can be instantly filled with the thoughts of others.</p> <p>I firmly believe that boredom is good for brain health, and I&#x2019;m banishing podcasts for the month from my phone to bring boredom back into my life.</p> </blockquote> <p>I had cut back on my podcast subscriptions just a week before <span class="small-caps">CGP</span> Grey first talked about his experiment on Hello Internet. And the way, he worded his reasons for why giving up on podcasts was a key part of his experiment to reduction just persuaded me to go ahead with my plan.</p> <p>So I have 10 subscriptions (down from 35) now, with just 3 technology related podcasts. One releases on Monday, another on Wednesday and the last one on Friday. That&#x2019;s it, the week&#x2019;s quota of the technology news is covered. One podcasts is a microcast, arrives on Monday. There four are the only ones that are set to auto-downloads. All the remaining 6 are released without any fixed schedule. I decide whether to listen to them only after I read what they are about and if that interests me.</p> <p>I have been on this<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>diet plan&#x201D; of podcasts consumption for at least a month now and I am already observing significant differences. I am listening to music, a lot more, again. My mind has become curious again - there is space for some thought experiments. There are times when I just don&#x2019;t carry my headphones with me even when I am going to places alone. Anyway, with nothing to listen to, there is no incentive to carry them along. So I either read on my phone or just talk to people around. <em>Surprisingly</em>, I find it a lot better, more effective use of the time.</p> <p>However, this also means I have some time to fill during my drive to office or the morning/evening runs. To address that, I have renewed my Audible subscription&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;listening to Audiobooks would at least be better than podcasts. Or so I think, for now.</p> <h2 id="no-news-experiment">No-news Experiment</h2> <p>I was also on <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/journal/65762/">an experiment</a> 3 months back where I had decided that the only way I would consume news would be via my morning newspaper. And my hypothesis was I would feel a lot less burdened to know what&#x2019;s going on and so be a bit more focused on the work at the hand.</p> <p>As an extension, I had also uninstalled all the related apps. No Twitter. No news apps. No notifications from social apps (Messages, WhatsApp). The idea was it is just better to stay away from the temptation to check <em>what&#x2019;s going on</em>.</p> <p>I am glad that I have following the set rules for 3 months now and I thought it would be right moment to update on that experiment.</p> <p>It indeed is a not less burdensome to be away from the news. I do not think I have missed anything major or urgent in these last few months. Newspaper provides me with the detailed reporting and not just blurbs. Opinion pieces provide better context on the important ones. The useless news, whose whole purpose is to satisfy the need for the news website or <span class="small-caps">TV</span> channels to keep<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>reporting&#x201D; something, anything new, get filtered out by the editors. After all, there is a limited pace to fill in the pages on the printed paper.</p> <p>So I am no longer bludgeoned with a constant stream of everything that&#x2019;s negative. With that, I think there is a lot less crap in the world than I was made to believe.</p> <p>Is it bad out there? Sure. But at least I ain&#x2019;t bogged down by the insignificant drivel that the world is full of.</p>

			 <p>I don&#x2019;t understand Google&#x2019;s call screening feature. How does it solve the spam calls problem? Don&#x2019;t I have to be equally attentive when the call arrives? I don&#x2019;t think the problem is I have to <em>receive</em> the call, problem is I <em>get</em> the call in the first place.</p> <p>Rather I am more distracted reading transcripts and making decisions. It looks to be targeted at the automated machine-driven calls. Human spammers/scammers will still have to be handled.</p> <p>In most cases, the spam calls I get start with a person, a human, asking if it indeed is me. Then goes on to specify the call is about some information related to my account or a service I am using. And then comes the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>offer for you&#x201D; part. I tend to disconnect right at first step when someone wants to know if me is indeed me.</p> <p>What&#x2019;s to say the call screening will transcribe something like<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>This is xyz from abc bank and this is a service information call.&#x201D;?</p> <p>Anyway, no doubt Google has a great technology at its hands and the showcase via this use case sounds a lot coherent than the general duplex demo we saw during I/O. I am just perplexed how everyone seems to be already sold that this solves the problem which it isn&#x2019;t even targeting.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> The post isn&#x2019;t intended to be judgemental of the feature, rather it was, to be frank, in response to the constant perspective of<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>this is so useful, I need it now&#x201D; from all around. But I could hardly understand why. John Gruber&#x2019;s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/10/11/nguyen-pixel-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this comment</a> finally triggered this.</p> <blockquote> <p>man oh man, do I want that feature (<em>Call Screening</em>) on iOS.</p> </blockquote> <p>Even Sarah Perez described the problem with scam calls succinctly in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/10/apple-needs-a-feature-like-googles-call-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her opinion piece</a> at TechCrunch.</p> <blockquote> <p>Nearly half of all cellphone calls next year will be from scammers. And their tactics have gotten much worse in recent months.</p> <p>They now often trick people by claiming to be the <span class="small-caps">IRS</span>, a bank, government representatives, and more. They pretend you&#x2019;re in some sort of legal trouble. They say someone has stolen your bank card. They claim you owe taxes. Plus, they often use phone number spoofing tricks to make their calls appear local in order to get recipients to pick up.</p> </blockquote> <p>I get it, it&#x2019;s a problem. But Call Screening solves it how? I could not find the answer to that question in the whole post.</p>

			 <p><strong>Update:</strong> David has added a <a href="https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot/commit/0eb301b8c64a48843c54f1401d8ce0c61f2c6143" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new function</a> <span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>to step around the issues micro.blog was having with images in Blot&#x2019;s <span class="small-caps">RSS</span> feeds&#x201D;. This change should allow using the Blot&#x2019;s caching feature.</p> <p>For all the defaults templates, David has already deployed the fix. So you should have the issue sorted without any update. If you have a custom template, to enable this change, wrap the html component around with the function <code>absoluteURLs</code> in your <span class="small-caps">RSS</span> file. For example, if you use <code>html</code>, use the below block in your description feed of your rss file (typically <code>feed.rss</code>).</p> <pre><code>{ {#absoluteURLs}} { { {html}}} { {/absoluteURLs}}</code></pre> <hr /> <p>When you publish a micro post (one without title) on Blot which has images in it, Blot uses a <span class="small-caps">CDN</span> by default to store for these images. Though it may be helpful overall in blog performance, it causes some issues while interoperating with micro.blog. You will find that these images are not visible on its timeline.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s a known issue where micro.blog is unable to parse these images. To enable the images posted on Blot to appear on micro.blog timeline, make following changes with the configuration.</p> <ol type="1"> <li>You can disable the blot cdn. This option is available on the Blot <a href="https://blot.im/settings/services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">settings</a> page under Settings &gt; Services &gt; Cache And Optimize Images. This makes the images be served directly under your blog&#x2019;s domain. This change does not take much time to propagate, you will see the change reflect in the <code>url</code> for the images.</li> <li>In addition, by default (in most themes), images may have relative urls. For example, you might just put <code>\_images\&lt;IMAGE_NAME&gt;</code> while adding the image to the post. However,these relative paths are again not parsed by micro.blog well (though most feed readers do it well). Anyway, to overcome this problem just include the complete url of the image while adding it (for example, <code>http://&lt;BLOGNAME&gt;/&lt;PATH&gt;</code>).</li> </ol> <p>These changes should be enough to allow your images to be visible at m.b timeline.</p>

			 <p>It&#x2019;s been some time now that I have started again to regularly write, post my thoughts. Long and short. One of the key reason for this change in my behaviour, my returned inclination to write has been the changed follow behavior. I am reading interesting posts that make me think, that make me question my beliefs. And for each such question, I have a reaction &#x2014; a post.</p> <p>It is all thanks to the community at Micro.blog for convincing me that every post, irrespective of how short it is, is worth putting out there. It is a way to be social. I was doing so on other social networks like Twitter anyway - through all the likes, tweets and retweets. Why not take it to the next level and do the same on, as <a href="http://inessential.com/2018/02/01/why_micro_blog_is_not_another_app_net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brent Simmons had called it</a>, <em>the</em> social network - the web?</p> <blockquote> <p>But if you think of the years 1995-2005, you remember when the web was our social network: blogs, comments on blogs, feed readers, and services such as Flickr, Technorati, and BlogBridge to glue things together.</p> </blockquote> <p>And so that is what I have been doing. Reading from the web, reacting on the web - my website.</p> <p>IndieWeb also played a huge part in helping me to go social on web though. It allowed me to post to my site my reactions to what I was reading on web. I could easily like a post, reply to it or even repost part of it and that in itself became a new post on my site - I called them the social posts. So as long as I had the posts tagged with appropriate microformats and was able to send a webmention to a site, I was interacting on web.</p> <p>I need not be part of any siloed platform, I need not shout. All that mattered was I expressed. And just with that, I have been the most social I ever was online.</p>

			 <p>I am a serial procrastinator, I am not proud of it. Any hint of a distraction and I go crazy running behind that.</p> <p>I also lack the skill to follow a routine. I lack the drive to not miss the day-to-day<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>schedule&#x201D; every day, weekday and weekend alike. I think I have been shaped by the societal dislike for any thing routine.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span><em>Routine is boring</em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span>, I have been told since childhood. But I am slowly coming to realise that a daily routine may be the best solution to my procrastination problem.</p> <p>My dad loves his routine. He wakes up at exactly the same time daily, carries out the same morning choir. He goes for his morning walk. Follows that up with his morning tea and a newspaper. He gets ready for his office. He has his lunch and drives to his office. Spends the same amount of time working. Comes back at home at exactly the same time. A serial or two on television, then dinner. Plan and prepare for the next day. Gets his end of day dose of news. Finally, he goes to bed just as he wakes up, at same time daily. And I have seen him following this routine of his at least since I remember. And even being close to sixty, he looks a lot less tired and a lot more fresh than any of us in thirties do.</p> <p>Procrastination is a blanket idea all problems are swept under. But it&#x2019;s the lack of routine which causes most of the issues in the first place. A routine may lend that time to procrastinate at that odd moment.</p> <p>And the current lifestyle of mine is largely at fault. I tend to spend time in office till the work is done, which rarely gets done in time anyway. All that causes is random office hours. I do things which do not fit in the regular schedule - I would watch a live match or binge watch a new series late into the night. Weekends are marked for getaways, that means just lazy around, neither being productive nor relieved. I never go to sleep on time, so I never wake at the same time.</p> <p>So, on this birthday I decided to stop leading my life so. I am going to follow a routine. I have been sleeping on the same time, getting up on the same time. Reaching office and leaving for home at the same time. I next need to plan the rest of the day too, fit my other interests around the routine tasks.</p> <p>I need to get inspired by my dad. Doesn&#x2019;t matter then if I get called a bore. I believe it would be worth it if I am at least a tad more satisfied.</p>

			 <p>I read <a href="https://ha.x0r.be/posts/chrome-is-a-google-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this interesting perspective from B&#xE1;lint</a> where he argues that<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Chrome is a Google Service that happens to include a Browser Engine&#x201D;. I understand where he is coming from, but I believe the thought process needs to be dealt with and curbed before it gets commonly accepted.</p> <p>Sure, Google would want to believe that Chrome is just one of their many services&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;it suits their business model. When they can move their trackers (and eventually ads) right to the tool that people access the internet with, they would know what everyone&#x2019;s doing on the internet. But Google should not be allowed to get away by dumping the idea down its user&#x2019;s throat. Sure, normal people may not be able to differentiate how logging in to a service and to Chrome is different. Or how login/session cookies for Google may screw up the security model on a shared computer.</p> <p>But that exactly is the reason why people who understand better need to voice their disapproval. It is easy to say that it&#x2019;s not a big deal as I am already better informed to not use Chrome. But it is also reckless&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;Chrome has already become a de facto browser for mainstream users. It&#x2019;s a wrong precedent then to let people who cannot fully grasp (or aren&#x2019;t inclined to out of sheer neglect) the basic underpinnings of the open web to drive what&#x2019;s acceptable for a browser, and on the web. If that was allowed, Net neutrality would already have been a lost battle worldwide. Such decisions tend to be uninformed and harm the community in the longer run.</p> <p>An internet service is a different entity, it serves a specific purpose. It solves a specific problem that an end user has. Gmail is an email client. YouTube is a video sharing service. Google Search is&#x2026; well, it has long since stopped being just a search engine. But, one gets the idea. You access a <span class="small-caps">URL</span> and it brings you to the service.</p> <p>Chrome is not that. Chrome is a tool that allows users access these different services. And it is better if it stays that way. It&#x2019;s already bad that all browsers come with an incognito mode by default. It would be important that we do not introduce another mode just to go incognito from the owners of the browsers.</p> <p>I am sure B&#xE1;lint will agree and his final thought kind of sums it well.</p> <blockquote> <p>Part of me feels that this Chrome shared computer issue that Googlers mentioned is real, but it&#x2019;s also just too convenient to solve this by tieing Chrome closer to Google, you know?</p> </blockquote>

			 <p>There is a fascinating conversation on <a href="https://thisiscriminal.com/episode-97-palace-of-justice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">episode 97 of the Criminal podcast</a> with the now 99 year old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Ferencz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benjamin Ferencz</a>. He primarily talks about his experiences as an investigator of Nazi war crimes after the World War <span class="small-caps">II</span>. There are some gut-wrenching stories about the atrocities he witnessed against Jews, and against humanity. He also shares his experiences of his trial against the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>high-ranking members of Nazi Germany&#x2019;s death squad&#x201D;, a trial that he called<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>the plea of humanity to the law&#x201D;.</p> <p>But towards the end of the episode, there is this heart-warming tale from Mr.&#xA0;Ferencz. He talks about his wife who is 5 years older than him; whom he has been married to for last 72 years; whom he had never had a quarrel with. And he believes there is a very simple reason for that.</p> <blockquote> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>First of all, I am not suggesting we didn&#x2019;t have differences of opinion. But we never raised our voice. We never shouted. We never pounded a table. Because it&#x2019;s mutual respect, and caring for each other. They have a funny word for it that I don&#x2019;t like - love. I don&#x2019;t like the word. Because you could love a piece of cheese, you love that lovely day. I could love to go home. I would love to finish this interview. And I say if you say caring for somebody, that reflects better. And my wife now needs my care. This is the pay back time.&#x201D;</p> </blockquote> <p>Now and again, it helps to keep things simple - I guess experience must imbue you with such clarity of thoughts. From all the myriad of swanky adulations for the word and the feeling of<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>love&#x201D;, I would prefer the simplicity of<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>caring for somebody&#x201D;.</p>

			 <p>One thing that Google&#x2019;s scattered focus - multiple start-ups inside, than a cohesive company with multiple products - and culture allows is to steal mindshare from the tech news portal. Just access any and there is always some Google news being discussed. Win-win for both.</p>

			 <p>Today I decided to remove the Micro.blog app from the dock to a folder on the home screen. Screen Time showed I was hitting the limit for the social media usage almost everyday. Dock makes the access to an app way too easier.</p> <p>As much as I love the community on the platform, I don&#x2019;t think accessing the app out of habit, just to check what new things people are talking about since the last 10 mins, is healthy. I would want to use any app on my schedule, not just subconsciously dip in as my mind wanders.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>We need a directory of microbloggers. This fact is clear from the sheer number of discussions that happen on the <a href="https://micro.blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micro.blog</a> platform asking for recommendations on users by interests, or geography or something else.</p> <p>I just wanted to put down my thoughts on what such a directory would need to have for it to be helpful and not polluted with mess.</p> <ol type="1"> <li>Directory needs to have a vouch mechanism. A user mentions some information about himself, his followers vouch for that. And the vouch&#x2019;s what matters. Without such a mechanism, the system is prone to abuse, where people can pollute it with catchy tags without nothing to back it up with. We know how such systems are gamed. <span class="small-caps">SEO</span>. App Store tag words.</li> <li>Other users should be able to associate more information about a person, an extension of vouch. They only get shown if the concerned person accepts.</li> <li>Group types need to be limited. Possible options for groups need to be predefined. So geography - possibly timezones or countries, interests - sports or tech or writing etc, current events followed. Without this, it&#x2019;s again prone to abuse. This may also make aggregation/interface easier to manage. Tagmoji is already a good example.</li> <li>As <a href="https://micro.blog/bradenslen/839473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Enslen</a> opined, may be it should not be limited to micro.blog platform. One should be able to provide other details too. May be via IndieAuth signin?</li> <li>An option to add to directory directly from a post would be handy. It may also allow building metadata for the vouch system, if needed.</li> <li>A person&#x2019;s interests, geography, isn&#x2019;t it an extension of one&#x2019;s identity? Can it not be captured as part of one&#x2019;s <code>h-card</code>?</li> </ol> <p>Can such a directory exist outside of Micro.blog? Sure (I even had basic one running on <a href="http://microthreads.amitg.xyz/micro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micro.threads</a> dev). But for it to be helpful it would need a significant number of users adding their information to such a service. I believe it fits best with the platform, as the list of users is already available. With some metadata added, a directory page, just like there are Tagmoji pages for posts, can be enabled for users. This will avoid creating a parallel user list, which will always be lesser than what would exists with the platform.</p> <p>Directory can be made as tricky as it can get. But it is sure one is required as the number of microbloggers grow. Blogrolls, personal directories on individual blogs are good starts. We need a place where that can be brought all together. And displayed easily on demand.</p>

			 <p>There is a lot of chatter recently around the features on Twitter/Facebook that should be incorporated in the new<a href="#footnote-1WLI" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-1WLI"><sup>1</sup></a> social media platforms. Or even the lack of the Twitter/Facebook like features that make the platforms better. Just look at the timelines at any of these platforms and you are bound to see some meta discussion on these lines. You will see it on Micro.blog. You will see it on Mastodon.</p> <p>Let&#x2019;s just take a couple of examples. Here&#x2019;s how Mastodon&#x2019;s boost <a href="https://www.codesections.com/blog/mastodon-elevator-pitch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is presented as better</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Boosts are essentially like retweets, with one key difference: there&#x2019;s no option to add your own commentary. You simply can&#x2019;t post something awful with a message saying how awful it is&#x2014;all you can do is boost something awful without commentary.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, I can&#x2019;t be the only one to remember the early Twitter days when retweets were just that, without commentary. It was all the third party clients that had an option to<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>quote&#x201D; tweet. Remember those days of appending<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span><span class="small-caps">RT</span>:&#x201D;, etc? We were using the feature and Twitter was forced to officially support it.</p> <p>Same was the case with hashtags, another feature that made experience on Twitter a nightmare - but was brought in because users were<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>enjoying&#x201D; it. We kept boasting we brought the hashtags to Twitter and now we want nothing to do with it.</p> <p>Don&#x2019;t get me wrong here. I do not want to sound like a Twitter apologist. The platform is in a dire state and their current and previous owners are rightly to be blamed here. As I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/1534753789149">recently wrote</a>, I have no sympathy for these folks. Examples mentioned above are not the primary reasons why Twitter, and Facebook, are struggling.</p> <p>But it is worth considering the fact that many of the features being touted as responsible for Twitter&#x2019;s fall are ones introduced by its users.</p> <p>So a plea to all the decision makers behind these<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>new&#x201D; platforms - don&#x2019;t let us, your users, drive the roadmap for you. We cannot foresee what&#x2019;s right. You on the other hand can decide where you want to take your platform. That may mean some people won&#x2019;t ride along and get left behind. But, at times, it is better to follow what&#x2019;s right in the long run than chase the immediate growth.</p> <p>I know people behind both Micro.blog and Mastodon are making these design decisions very carefully<a href="#footnote-2WLI" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-2WLI"><sup>2</sup></a>, and are not heeding to the pressure.</p> <p>So just stick to your beliefs, Manton, Eugen and others.

			 <p>I recently wanted to create a new view (a page) for all my <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/social">social posts</a>. Apparently, even if you create the page there are still few additional configurations to be done for the template to make it available at a particular link.</p> <p>Configuration to be done is to define a route which will serve that particular page. This can be done on the web editor at Blot dashboard in the template section.</p> <note> As of now, this is only possible when local editing is disabled. So if you have the local editing enabled, you can disable it to access the below mentioned sections. </note> <p>You can create a new<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&#x2018;</span>view&#x2019; on the web editor in the view section of the templates (available at <code>https://blot.im/template/&lt;theme-name&gt;/view</code>).</p> <p>Once you create a new view, go to settings page for the newly created view and specify its route. For example, the route (or <span class="small-caps">URL</span>) for <code>archives.html</code> is set to <code>/archives</code>. This enables the Blot engine to render the given template view at the configured <span class="small-caps">URL</span>. You can explore the <code>archives</code> view for more options.</p>

			 <p>With all the <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/1534344086159">recent discussions</a> around Mastodon and how it is different, <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">possibly better</a>, I thought there is no way to judge that without using the platform first, be a<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>native resident&#x201D;.</p> <p>But I have come to realise one fact, I just can&#x2019;t post actively at multiple places. Especially important, none of those places can <em>not</em> be my blog. It has to be posted on my blog first and may then flow into other systems. <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="small-caps">POSSE</span></a>.</p> <p>Micro.blog was covered, via feeds. It had also got me covered for Twitter. Mastodon didn&#x2019;t look to be an easy case. There is no easy way to push updates from feeds to Mastodon. Web hooks may be the only feasible way. I thought I had to get a more seamless solution than that.</p> <p>And what better may to do that than syndicating right while posting. So I have updated <a href="https://github.com/am1t/blotpub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blotpub</a> to support syndication to Mastodon. I can now indicate the Micropub clients to syndicate current posts to Mastodon. Nice!</p>

			 <p>I have been a lot restless these last few days. My mind wanders a lot, it&#x2019;s cluttered, full of thoughts. Full of things I need to do. Things that I can, I should do. I start working on one, and then my mind forces me to move on to another. Without completing any.</p> <p>I do not think that&#x2019;s really healthy. I think I may have to put my mind at rest.</p> <p>Meditation is, of course, one of the way. So I started looking out for all the help possible, to figure out how to get started. And guess what? It&#x2019;s a market full of catchy, link-baity articles from opportunistic freaks. Anyway, I think I may not get much help on the internet; may be there is just no need to go out there, seeking help on getting started. I may as well just <em>get started</em> - so I have started with an app called <a href="https://www.oakmeditation.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oak</a>. I have had a couple of sessions and have been pretty satisfied.</p> <p>I will continue to have these sessions as beginner and see what happens. I am really hopeful that meditation helps, that it allows me to regain focus. I know few people who have benefitted, I know of a strong proponent in <a href="https://micro.blog/ablaze" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ablaze</a>. Actually, it is his experiences that have inspired me towards meditation.</p> <p>If these couple of sessions are any indication, am sure it will be a good experience to go through.</p>

			 <p>I have recently observed a lot of anger from people across the world towards social networks of all forms. Especially Twitter. I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/why-not-quit-twitter">had also expressed</a> why I can&#x2019;t quit Twitter completely for now - there are still a few people left there whom I follow, and a few friends.</p> <p>I recently had a discussion with one such friend whom I was trying to convince to give up on Twitter and move all his posting to his custom domain. I demoed Micro.blog and Blot, hoping that the simplicity of getting started would be enough to abate any friction the change might throw at him.</p> <p>He listened patiently, he is an active poster on Twitter. He has a distinct voice and perspective towards all varied things. And so my attempt had a selfish tinge too; it would help me if I could follow his posts in feed readers, even better if on Micro.blog.</p> <p>He looked genuinely curios.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>But what&#x2019;s the big deal with owning the content and the domain?&#x201D; I thought I had his attention.</p> <p>I gave him the standard pitch, primarily how it would lend him control of his online identify, allow him not to lose his words when some private silo decides to change the rules of its services and how, if that happens, he can decide to take his content and move to some place better.</p> <p>All he said in response was<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>what&#x2019;s so special with what I write on the web that I would want to maintain it over time? If Twitter dies tomorrow, I will just move to some place else.&#x201D;</p> <p>I was left astonished. Here&#x2019;s a guy who has been posting his opinions on all things, at times even as Tweetstorms, sharing some fascinating stuff for all; here&#x2019;s a guy who has produced at least a short novel worth of content on Twitter and Facebook, but <em>has the least attachment to his words</em>.</p> <p>May be it&#x2019;s a regional trend, may be people in some places are more forward, more open to spending money and effort for the control.</p> <p>But one thing is for sure. We can never convince people to give up silos and start owning their identities, their content on their own domain or start moving to services like Micro.blog till we make them realise how worthy the words they write are. Even tweet length ones.</p>

			 <p>Here&#x2019;s a list of articles I liked throughout the day.</p> <p>1. I do not think there is any debate on whether Artificial Intelligence will have some unplanned consequences. There would be. It is as good as a new <em>species</em>. And when two new species start communicating with one another, there would be hiccups and miscommunication. I guess the only fear is this time the other species might actually be smarter. Wired has some <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/when-bots-teach-themselves-to-cheat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interesting real life examples</a> covered.</p> <blockquote> <p>Given a clear goal, an algorithm can master complex tasks, such as beating a world champion at Go. But even with logical parameters, it turns out that mathematical optimization empowers bots to develop shortcuts humans didn&#x2019;t think to deem off-&#xAD;limits. Teach a learning algorithm to fish, and it might just drain the lake.</p> </blockquote> <p>2. I had no idea there were multiple theories for the reason behind Dinosaurs&#x2019; extinction. I always believed the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>a fairy tale:<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&#x2018;</span>Big rock from sky hits the dinosaurs, and boom they go.&#x2019;&#x201D; Well, that may not be the case. Bianca Bosker <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/09/dinosaur-extinction-debate/565769/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has a fascinating coverage</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Before the asteroid hypothesis took hold, researchers had proposed other, similarly bizarre explanations for the dinosaurs&#x2019; demise: gluttony, protracted food poisoning, terminal chastity, acute stupidity, even Paleo-weltschmerz&#x2014;death by boredom. These theories fell by the wayside when, in 1980, the Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning physicist Luis Alvarez and three colleagues from <span class="small-caps">UC</span> Berkeley announced a discovery in the journal Science</p> </blockquote> <p>3. Being ethical is not black and white. It is almost impossible to lead a life which you claim has been ethical and to make everyone agree. However,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>figuring out how to live the good life is fun&#x201D; - <a href="https://qz.com/1327804/its-impossible-to-lead-a-totally-ethical-life-but-its-fun-to-try/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a great essay</a> by Ephrat Livni.</p> <blockquote> <p>By virtue of accidents of birth, we find ourselves unfairly profiting from all kinds of inequalities, depending on where we are born, who our parents are, our racial or ethnic backgrounds, and more. Your passport determines more than just access&#x2014;it means you are the beneficiary, albeit abstractly, of actions you may not approve. Most of us, wherever we live, are funding wars or policies we disagree with. We can&#x2019;t help but do wrong.</p> </blockquote> <p>4. A <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/claudiakoerner/people-are-donating-millions-of-frequent-flyer-miles-to" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">much-needed account</a> from a non-profit group<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>that reunites refugees around the world with families&#x201D;. Another reminder that we humans have heart beating incessantly within. Some may have painted it black, but as a species, we will keep fighting back.</p> <blockquote> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>While hundreds of families separated at the US&#x2013;Mexico border under the Trump administration&#x2019;s&#x201D;zero tolerance&#x201D; policy remain apart, a Michigan woman has inspired people to help reunite loved ones by donating their frequent flyer miles.&#x201D;</p> </blockquote>

			 <p>I wish micro.blog becomes bigger, more diverse with more voices spread across the world, the timezones, narrate their stories. It becomes difficult for a user from a non-American timezone to benefit from the timeline. It is either crawling or swings past as you stay asleep. I have to consume posts via feeds and depend on Micro.threads to pull out posts that lead to discussion overnight.</p> <p>I fear though if the place becomes bigger before there are tools in place to handle the scale, we may inundate it with too many voices and interactions. Making it extremely difficult and unpleasant to follow along for any person. We need to tread carefully.</p> <p>It is important the service attracts both established <em>and</em> diverse voices.

			 <p>Dave Winer wrote few of <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/09/141354.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his thoughts</a> on how the search engines need to improve with time. He was focused a bit on how it can make blogging valuable. However he also had a underlying criticism for current search engines, mainly Google.</p> <blockquote> <p>Sorry Google, your search engine is showing serious signs of age and boredom. We can do so much better. (&#x2026;) It&#x2019;s (<em>Google</em>) been stagnant for too long. They clearly need some competition.</p> </blockquote> <p>I think it&#x2019;s high time the way search results are presented to the user had some rethinking and redesigning exercise done. Search for anything and it is still a list of links (or an <span class="small-caps">AMP</span> carousel when it fits your business needs) even after more than 15 years since it was introduced. I do not think there is anyone who ever paginates to the third page of search results. I would bet more than 90% don&#x2019;t even go to the second page.</p> <p>I believe when people search for something they have a fair idea of what they are looking for. Search engines need to be smart in understanding if the user is searching for a place on the web or a general query around concepts. If it is the former, it should present every data it has about that place, in a manner that&#xA0; easy to grasp. Dave&#x2019;s list already has some good ideas. Give as much context as there is out there.</p> <p>For later, it is important to focus on credibility and transparency. For example when a query is on some technical concept, it is good to show the discussions on Stack Overflow. In addition, it would be good to also show the articles that were referenced from those discussions separately. Don&#x2019;t go along sweeping the web for all the key words. Without credible shares, it hardly matters and just gets exploited. Someone sharing it while discussions attaches a credibility factor to it.</p> <p>Google&#x2019;s attempt with Knowledge panel is good. But I believe it needs to be more transparent in communicating why it is displaying what it is displaying there.</p>

			 <p>I am reading a lot of views these days from people I respect deciding to leave Twitter. And this is after a similar exodus from Facebook pretty recently.</p> <p>But this time it looks to be different; for one they are putting too much effort with their Twitter profiles. They are deleting their tweets, resetting their profile information to convey that they are not<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>here&#x201D; and resolving to not posting on Twitter again. Well, some are even ready to pay some shady<a href="#footnote-1BYR" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-1BYR"><sup>1</sup></a> services to get the tweets deleted.</p> <p><a href="http://inessential.com/2018/08/08/the_public_square" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brent Simmons did it</a>. Matt Haughey <a href="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/2018/08/08/im-done-with-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">followed a similar approach</a>. And there are many more people doing the same.</p> <p>I, on the other hand, was just reading through the articles and sitting there wondering what&#x2019;s different this time. I was looking for that one argument to not simply delete the account. Quit Twitter completely. Best I could get was from Matt.</p> <blockquote> <p>I&#x2019;ll continue to read twitter occasionally, and I might keep on liking tweets, but I&#x2019;m not going to send another tweet until the service changes or the management changes in very drastic ways.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, if you are still not exiting Twitter, how&#x2019;s it helping? I am afraid the place will only become messier with all the respectable voices leaving the platform.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s like being part of a coffee club that used to meet often in a coffee house of the group&#x2019;s choice. Each one of the group would talk and discuss on varied topics. It was a fun place where you could learn so much. And get to know of so many new things and news all around the world.</p> <p>But slowly the coffee house became louder, with some hateful voices propagating their distasteful views. You look to the owner of the place and hope that he doesn&#x2019;t be <em>a jack</em> and acts; you hope he asks these people to leave. And block them from coming to this place ever and ruining the experience of many such clubs as yours. But when you realise that the owner isn&#x2019;t going to do so, you decide <em>you</em> need to act. So you decide to take your group and discussion to a better, saner place.</p> <p>The question to ponder at then is would you still visit the old coffee house daily and see what&#x2019;s being discussed and voiced and promulgated?</p> <section class="footnotes"> <hr /> <ol> <li id="footnote-1BYR"><p>Why shady? Well you need to give them tweets and access to your profile. And some apparently post to your profile saying you use their service.

			 <p>This is a must read article from Ben Werdm&#xFC;ller where he concisely conveys the problem around fake news<a href="#footnote-1WR2" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-1WR2"><sup>1</sup></a> and also presents how different players in the system can contribute in their own way.</p> <blockquote> <p>How can trust be regained by the media, and how could the web become more credible?</p> <p>There are a few ways to approach the problem: from a bottom-up, user driven perspective; from the perspective of the publishers; from the perspective of the social networks used to disseminate information; and from the perspective of the web as a platform itself.</p> </blockquote> <p>Social networks have to play a big part, changing their outlook, their perspective to the problem is important. And that is one aspect that is discussed the most. However, the other players in this - we the users, the publishers and the web as a platform will also have to play a significant role if this increasingly painful blight is to be addressed.</p> <p>It was really fascinating to read Ben talk about the web - in his words <em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>a peaceful, decentralized network of human knowledge and creativity, designed and maintained for everyone in the world&#x201D;</em>. That is perfect. As <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/open-hypermedia">I had shared recently</a> as part of another post, it is high time the web, and the gateways to the web, introduce more ways to capture the context from the readers and present the same in a simpler manner for all the future readers. A link can stay contextless, but it is important that the information it lays out is vetted by every one who consumes it.</p> <p>It is welcome to see that groups like <a href="https://credweb.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="small-caps">W3C</span> Credible Web Community Group</a> already exists and even the established players are getting involved to build a<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>more credible web&#x201D;.</p> <section class="footnotes"> <hr /> <ol> <li id="footnote-1WR2"><p>I like the usage of words<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>false information online&#x201D; better<a href="#ref-1WR2" class="footnote-back">&#x21A9;</a></p></li> </ol> </section>

			 <p>Micro.blog is the only service that I use which uses email-only authentication. And it is a win-some-lose-some experience. There are times, especially on mobile, when I love that there is no password involved. I open the email in my client, click a link and I am in. But then there are times, especially when I am on a system where I just don&#x2019;t want to login to my email, I would prefer authenticating via a device I own, I trust - usually my mobile.</p> <p>On IndieAuth front, I completely agree with Glenn.

			 <blockquote> <p>The Web is, without a doubt, the most powerful research tool currently available to man. No longer must researchers comb through endless indices and catalogues to find what they are looking for.</p> <p>In spite of its tremendous improvements on what came before, however, the Web is frankly a disappointment in comparison to what it could be. Most saddening, perhaps, is the way in which the Web constrains the use of links. For example: although the link is the primary form of reference on the Web, underpinning the tangle of connections that make the system so useful, the ability to create new links is a privilege granted only to content producers. The vast majority of those interested in a piece of work are merely readers, unable to contribute, only to consume.</p> </blockquote> <p>Even though a bit unrealistic, this work by Joe Savage around open hypermedia is a fascinating exploration of what happens when you take link-based web systems outside of the web browsers. The possibilities are endless as it opens up a completely new paradigm to hyper linking&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;this takes it across all apps.</p> <p>And therein lies the biggest friction for this concept. Expecting every app to support this is too much to ask from the developers who are already running thin meeting the changing expectations of the primary platform they are built for.</p> <p>The simple goal of bringing annotations to the web (which should address some of the concerns the open hypermedia attempts to handle) itself has been attempted so many times, but has failed to stick.</p> <p>Anyway, for the research community, the prototype system as demonstrated below should work wonders. And they might welcome this. But it is a long shot to expect this to be implemented and accepted anytime soon.</p> <div style="width:0;height:0"> </div><div class="videoContainer" style="padding-bottom:56.5%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SAYL9YzY0WU?rel=0&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

			 <p>Since I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/micropub-endpoint-for-blot">introduced blotpub</a> a couple of days back, I have been continuously posting to the site from different Micropub clients. And I am happy that the system worked well. Added satisfaction was provided by the community by expressing interest and openness to try the endpoint out.</p> As I had mentioned in that post, handling &#x201C;the creation of like and reply post types&#x201D; was next on the list. I just couldn&#x2019;t live with the fact that the endpoint didn&#x2019;t handle these simple post types. So, it had to be addressed. And it is addressed now &#x2014; <note> the latest version of blotpub handles replies and like posts. </note> <p>The information is added as properties <code>in-reply-to</code> and <code>like-of</code> to the post metadata.</p> In addition, <note> support has been added to explicitly place the date property as part of the metadata. </note> <p>Earlier, file creation date was used as the post date. The enhancement was discussed with <a href="https://micro.blog/jack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@jack</a> as part of this <a href="https://github.com/am1t/blotpub/issues/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">git issue</a>. With this version, if the published date is provided, it would be set in the metadata. Else date-time for post creation request would be used. To enable this, just set <code>SET_DATE</code> environment variable to <code>true</code>. Additionally, you can also set the <code>TZ</code> variable to override default timezones for the server hosting your endpoint. Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/am1t/blotpub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>README</code></a> for more details.</p> <p>I have also fixed some minor issues in handling the post creation via different clients, mainly Micro.blog iOS client.</p> <p><strong><em>What&#x2019;s next?</em></strong> Handling of image files.</p>

			 <p><strong>Updated: 05-Aug 15:15</strong></p> <p>I am seriously considering the option to make this blot blog as my primary site. I do not want to take decision in haste. So here I am jotting down the things I will have to sort out before the switch. This would be a rolling list.</p> <ol type="1"> <li>Moving all the old posts to Blot. This should primarily involve handling of metadata. Hugo frontmatter needs to be converted to something that Blot can parse. Tricky part is going to be around dates and tags.</li> <li>Handling of redirecting journal posts. Currently they are available at <code>/journal/&lt;postname&gt;</code>. This will have to redirected to <code>/&lt;postname&gt;</code>.</li> <li>Handling of redirecting <code>lab.</code> urls. All the current blot posts will move to <code>www</code> subdomain.</li> <li>Handling of Blot images redirect or modification of the posts.</li> <li>Moving of the <code>/now</code> and <code>/about</code> pages to blot.</li> </ol> <p>As I jot this down, there is another option that looks simpler (and so more probable).</p> <p>Blot becomes my blog, replaces journal on the current site. Hugo site remains my main site. I will not move any posts, journals or pages. Everything in the old site remains in the old site. All the formatting rework is avoided.</p> <p>I can move the complete journal section to an archive link in the footer. Blot will be serving <code>/blog</code>. <code>/lab</code> will be redirected.</p> <p>Main site navigations will be Home | Arcticles | Blog | Now | About</p> <p>That means the current site will keep serving my long form posts, the articles. Ones for which I spend significant time, I have a machine available to write over the days. And I can control the publish process. The blot blog will sever my thoughts, ones that I need to quickly put out, may be mostly while mobile.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Continuing <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/tagged/blot">my experiments</a> with Blot, and as <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/indiewebify-blot-site">a next step</a> in Indiewebifying it, I had recently sorted out the webmentions setup and display.</p> <p>There was one final piece of puzzle missing, one that I had posted in a <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/theme-refresh">recent update</a> on the theme refresh.</p> <blockquote> <p>Why not make this the primary homepage? Well, I am still on the journey of indiewebifying this place. I still post to my site using other apps, mainly Quill and Micro.blog. Until I get the micropub endpoint that I am working on done, I will keep this place booked for my excursions, my experiments.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, I finally managed to get a basic version of one worked out. Basic, but a workable version. Introducing <a href="https://github.com/am1t/blotpub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blotpub</a>.</p> <p>It is a self-hosteable Micropub endpoint for blot.im and Dropbox. It accepts Micropub requests, creates a simple Blot posts and saves them to a configured Dropbox folder. This enables updating a Blot blog through a Micropub client.</p> <p>I have tested creation of both long and short posts via <a href="https://quill.p3k.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quill</a>. It supports creation of posts with or without titles. For me, the former are my micro posts while later are more of the long form articles.</p> <p>It also supports metadata creation for tags and slugs as part of the post documents.</p> <p>With this, I have my basic needs covered. Most of the time, I am posting text posts; the current version should be able to handle that.</p> <p>Next, I need to handle the creation of like and reply post types and also handle the image files. It may so happen that I end up getting these done soon. However, I wanted to put the bare bones version out there.</p> <h3 id="how-do-i-use-this">How do I use this?</h3> <p>Well, as I said earlier the <a href="https://github.com/am1t/blotpub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source is open</a>. It is a Node application which you can self-host as your own micropub endpoint. I have covered some of the details as part of the project <a href="https://github.com/am1t/blotpub/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">readme</a>.</p> <p>However, before you use blotpub, there is one essential step from IndieWeb that needs to be addressed - to make your website your identity online. It involves declaring openly your social network profiles as rel-me links and link those profiles back to your site. This allows you to login to any IndieAuth enabled services using your website&#x2019;s homepage - no need to create an account or maintain passwords.</p> <p>You can refer to the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Essential IndiWeb&#x201D; section in <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/display-webmentions/#essential-indieweb">this post on how to display webmentions</a> on your site. That step applies to using a micropub too.</p> <div class="note"> This is an <strong>early alpha release</strong> of the application. Things may be a bit unstable. Please use it with caution. Also, I will continue to work on this and improve it, so, you may have to refresh your deployment regularly. However, I would be happy if you choose to join me on this bumpy ride - this will only get better with more people using it. </div> <ol type="1"> <li><p><strong>Install</strong>: Just install this as a normal Node.js application. A better way would be to <a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/am1t/blotpub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deploy directly to Heroku</a>.</p></li> <li><strong>Grant Dropbox Access</strong>: Generate a <a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2014/05/generate-an-access-token-for-your-own-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropbox access token</a> from the Dropbox <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Console</a> to grant the application access to your Dropbox folder. Just create a new app in the console, chose <span class="small-caps">API</span> as Dropbox <span class="small-caps">API</span>, select the type of access as<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Full Dropbox&#x201D; and finally, name your application. You will need this generated token while configuring your application. <note> Just to reiterate the point, the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Permission type&#x201D; for the app that you create for blotpub in dropbox needs to be set to<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Full Dropbox&#x201D; </note></li> <li><p><strong>Configure</strong>: Add the required configuration values via environment variables or the Heroku app deploy dashboard. You will need the token generated above.</p></li> <li><strong>Endpoint Discovery</strong>: Once you have deployed the application, your Micropub endpoint will be available at <code>/micropub</code> (e.g. <code>https://deployed-blotpub-app.com/micropub</code>). <note> Note that the endpoint url is different from your website url. It would be the url for the blotpub application that your installed in the 1st step. </note> <p>For Heroku deployment, it would be something like <code>https://*****.herokuapp.com/micropub</code> (exact url will be available at Heroku dashboard). To enable automatic discovery for your <a href="https://indieweb.org/micropub#Endpoint_Discovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micropub endpoint</a> and <a href="https://indieweb.org/obtaining-an-access-token#Discovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">token endpoint</a>, you will need to add the following values to your Blot site&#x2019;s <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> - usually available in the <code>head.html</code> file in your theme/template.</p></li> </ol> <pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;micropub&quot; href=&quot;https://deployed-blotpub-app.com/micropub&quot;&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;token_endpoint&quot; href=&quot;https://tokens.indieauth.com/token&quot;&gt;</code></pre> <ol start="5" type="1"> <li><p><strong>Media Endpoint:</strong> Most of the micropub clients, like quill, can send the media files as <code>multipart</code> data. So, you can attach image while creating a new post. However, some clients like Micro.blog require a <a href="https://indieweb.org/micropub_media_endpoint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Media Endpoint</a> to handle the media files (primarily the image files). Blotpub comes with an inbuilt media endpoint. To use it, just configure the <code>MEDIA_ENDPOINT</code> variable in your blotpub deployment to <code>https://deployed-blotpub-app.com/micropub/media</code> (for Heroku, something like <code>https://*****.herokuapp.com/micropub/media</code>). This will allow you to post image from such clients too.</p></li> <li><p>Note that file uploads via blotpub media endpoint will only add the image file at the location configured at <code>PHOTO_PATH</code> and the <span class="small-caps">URL</span> to the image will be added to the post metadata as <code>photo: &lt;url-to-image&gt;</code>. To render this in the post, you can add the below code block in <code>entries.html</code> and <code>entry.html</code> in your Blot theme either before or after <code>{{{html}}}</code> as per your preference.</p></li> </ol> <pre><code>{{#metadata.photo} } &lt;img src=&quot;{{metadata.photo} }&quot;&gt; {{/metadata.photo} }</code></pre> <p>You should now be able to post to your Blot site from external Micropub clients (like Micro.blog iOS App, Quill etc). If you do use this, ping me. All your feedback is welcome.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2018/08/02/164900.html">Theme Refresh for My Blot Blog</a></h1>

			 <p>I have observed that I have been more inclined recently to post on Blot blog. I do have <a href="https://amitgawande.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my main website</a> which I have been using for all things long and short. But there is some lure of the simplicity of this place. You write. You save. And the post is up.</p> <p>No committing a post to a remote repository, waiting then for the engine to trigger a build. No frantic refreshes to check if the post is up. It&#x2019;s simple.</p> <p>But every time I saw my published post here, I was left cringing at how awful the interface around was. I wish I could purely focus on the content and the process. But unfortunately I am wired a bit odd. I tend to focus on the design around first; if that sucks, I can&#x2019;t move on<a href="#footnote-14SL" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-14SL"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p> <p>So I had to take a pause today. If I was going to post more here, the place had to be cleaner.</p> <p>And given that I already had my <a href="http://github.com/am1t/blot-musings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom theme</a> up, I got down to work. I refreshed the theme and made it all about content<a href="#footnote-24SL" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-24SL"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p> <p>No navigation items or links to other places - a link opens the content. And in just the way I like it.</p> <p>No homepage summarising the place - <code>/home</code> opens the stream of my posts.</p> <p>No distinguishing posts by type - all posts are equal<a href="#footnote-34SL" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-34SL"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p> <p>For now, I am happy with this design. At least, I won&#x2019;t cringe when I open my own posts.</p> <p>Why not make this the primary homepage? Well, I am still on the journey of <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/indiewebify-blot-site">indiewebifying this place</a>. I still post to my site using other apps, mainly <a href="http://quill.p3k.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quill</a> and <a href="https://micro.blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micro.blog</a>. Until I get the micropub endpoint that I am <a href="https://lab.amitgawande.com/micropub-endpoint-from-the-ground-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working on</a> done, I will keep this place booked for my excursions, my experiments.</p> <section class="footnotes"> <hr /> <ol> <li id="footnote-14SL"><p>This is a costly habit. I can never signup for any service or an app that doesn&#x2019;t have a good design and <span class="small-caps">UI</span>.<a href="#ref-14SL" class="footnote-back">&#x21A9;</a></p></li> <li id="footnote-24SL"><p>There&#x2019;s no hiding, the design is heavily inspired by Brent Simmons <a href="http://inessential.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weblog</a>.

			 <p>Techmeme <a href="https://news.techmeme.com/180801/contextual" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced</a> a new form of ads today. This is how the homepage looked.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2020/b264047f03.jpg" alt="techmeme ads"></p> <p>And this how they introduced the prominent change visible out there.</p> <blockquote> <p>Today, Techmeme is introducing ads that are automatically placed under stories matching news topics that an advertiser wants to target. They&#x2019;re a great way to associate your brand with a specific category of technology products, or even to challenge individual companies.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>For instance, Yelp is now advertising against news about Google, to urge the search giant to<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Focus on the User&#x201D;.</p> </blockquote> <p>To be frank, I don&#x2019;t like this. Contextual advertising is overrated; it is prone to be misused by brands with power. Can a small upcoming player overcome an onslaught from the incumbents? It may be factual, but can be projected in an overly aggressive fashion.</p> <p>Anyway, I think the wonderful folks behind Techmeme are aware of the possible fallouts. And they believe they have the process to avoid that.</p> <blockquote> <p>Of course, there are limits to the sorts of messages we&#x2019;ll place. We&#x2019;ll decline to feature offensive or overly gimmicky ad copy. And we won&#x2019;t include negative ad messages aimed at current advertisers, in effect, guaranteeing a form of competitive separation.</p> </blockquote> <p>With the scale and scope of Techmeme, this might work, this might be enough. But I still believe it better not get into the muddy waters of contextual ads.</p>

			 <p>I recently received a great feedback and a query from <a href="https://micro.blog/cygnoir" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@cygnoir</a> at Micro.blog.</p> <blockquote> <p>The links you share are so interesting! I especially love that you give a bit of an excerpt. Are you auto-posting these somehow? If so, would you be willing to teach me (or point me in the right direction to learn)?</p> </blockquote> <p>Yes, I do read a lot of articles on web and share each one I like. And the reason I share them is I want others to read them too. I think it is difficult to convince people just with a title. So I also include an excerpt from the post that may give the readers an idea what the post is about (<a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/journal/40488/">sample</a>)</p> <p>For me this usually happens while am on mobile and so it is just isn&#x2019;t simple to copy and paste. So I have a system worked out on iOS with iA Writer and Workflow apps that allows me to easily post the links with excerpt.</p> <p>It starts with a template in iA Writer with placeholders for all the relevant sections - date, title, link and content that is to be shared.</p> <pre><code>--- title : &#x201C;&#x201D; date : {date} --- &#x2605; Liked &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;{link}&quot; class=&quot;u-like-of&quot; rel=&quot;like-of&quot;&gt;{title}&lt;/a&gt;&quot; &gt; {content}</code></pre> <p>I then have a Workflow which prepares the actual file with this template. I trigger this Workflow from Safari as Action Extension, which runs through the below process.</p> <ol type="1"> <li>Gets the current <span class="small-caps">URL</span> and puts it into a variable <code>link</code>.</li> <li>Gets the title of the current page and puts it into a variable <code>title</code>.</li> <li>Gets the contents of clipboard and sets it variable <code>content</code>.</li> <li>Gets the current <code>date</code> in required format.</li> <li>Picks up the above template and replaces appropriate placeholders with the actual values fetched earlier.</li> <li>Creates a new markdown file with this content and opens it in iA Writer for further processing. And publish.</li> </ol> <p>This system, though not perfect, works for me currently. I want to simplify it further - mainly using Micropub endpoint. But haven&#x2019;t got a chance to implement that yet. Till then, I am going to use this one.</p> <p>I have similar template and Workflow combinations for reply, image, link posts.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2018/07/26/185400.html">That One Shirt in Your Wardrobe</a></h1>

			 <p>Every wardrobe has that one shirt that uncovers itself after many days, from beneath the pile of new, blot-less clothes and mirrors back the reality to you. The reality that you have been ignoring the most important possession of yours, your health. It just won&#x2019;t fit anymore.</p> <p>You reminisce when this was part of your go-to attire. When nothing else looked good on you, nothing else suited you, fitted you, this one shirt always did. And now it doesn&#x2019;t. As if it never was yours.</p> <p>It hasn&#x2019;t changed much. <em>You</em>, on the other hand, have.</p> <p>So now the choice is yours. You either accept the signal, get back into shape. Or ignore it, pay for the consequences later.</p> <p>I think it is the same with life. And those forgotten habits, those expressions that had made you look good. That had suited you, defined you.</p> <p>And that one event that makes you realise you have changed enough that they don&#x2019;t suit you now.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s when you choose.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2018/07/25/000800.html">Podcasts Is a Costly Medium Even for Listeners</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2018/07/25/000800.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-07-25 00:08:00 &#43;0530">Jul 25, 2018</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I hate podcasts, because the medium is demanding. It demands so much time from me, demands focused attention to follow along. I wish I didn&#x2019;t find them so damn useful to keep giving in to the medium&#x2019;s demands.</p> <p>But to do so, I have to alter my regular habits to accommodate podcasts in the daily routine. Time that was consumed by music for majority part of my life is taken over by podcasts now. If I have even a minute free, earphones are plugged and I continue what I was listening to. There are times when I question whether the medium actually deserves so much of attention from me.</p> <p>So every now and then I look and relook at my subscribed podcasts list to decide which podcasts earn their place. I relook at my habits to see what I can change to make this manageable.</p> <ul> <li>If there is a podcast which I hardly listen to, it&#x2019;s unsubscribed.</li> <li>If there is one whose last episodes I hardly remember, it&#x2019;s unsubscribed.</li> <li>I rarely stay subscribed to podcasts that might talk about the same sets of topics (that means very few tech podcasts).</li> <li>I do not want news from the podcasts, I want views, perspectives.</li> <li>None with daily episodes. Rather I prefer podcasts that are spread across the week. So if I find that there are multiple (more than 3) podcasts delivering episodes on the same day, few are simply unsubscribed.</li> <li>I always listen at 1.2x speed.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Trim Silence&#x201D; mode is always on in PocketCasts. I do not care of the lost fidelity. I recently tried to let the silence stay on and I felt everyone was deliberately being a slow speaker.</li> <li>There is a big reason I use PocketCasts. Overcast is a loved app amongst the tech community and I tried hard to use it. But it just doesn&#x2019;t respect data usages limits. It either allows to download all episodes every time or not notify about a new episode at all. I, on the other hand, want to look at the episode, read what it&#x2019;s about and then decide whether to download. PocketCasts&#x2019; a lot more flexible.</li> <li>I like if the podcasts, especially long ones, do chapters. It&#x2019;s easier to skip over the topics I just have no interests in.</li> <li>I listen to ad reads if they aren&#x2019;t robotic, if the host believes in the product. That&#x2019;s least I can do to contribute for their efforts.</li> </ul>

[&#x2026;] Like many well-meaning but misguided baby boomers, neither of my parents received an elite education but they nevertheless believed that an expensive school was not a materialistic waste of money; it was the key to a better life than the one they had. They continued to put faith in this falsehood even after a previously unimaginable financial loss, and so we continued spending money that we didn&#x2019;t have&#x2014;money that banks kept giving to us.</p> </blockquote> <p>May be a devisive opinion, but student loan debt is a curse on our society. A person shouldn&#x2019;t be indebted in attempt to kick start his life.</p> <p>Throughout my whole life (one I controlled), I have attempted to not be under any sort of unavoidable debt. If that meant me not having or doing a thing that I <em>want</em> to, so be it. I know not all may share this perspective, may be not all can<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>afford&#x201D; the life without a form of debt (ironical, but practical), I have been thankful that I was able to put my life on track without falling behind the world around.</p> <blockquote> <p>The problem, I think, runs deeper than blame. The foundational myth of an entire generation of Americans was the false promise that education was priceless&#x2014;that its value was above or beyond its cost. College was not a right or a privilege but an inevitability on the way to a meaningful adulthood. What an irony that the decisions I made about college when I was seventeen have derailed such a goal.</p> </blockquote> <p>Perfect!</p>

So what&#x2019;s this film about? Every thinking mind has his own answer.</p> <blockquote> <p>And yet it&#x2019;s hard to look at this movie, made at a time of violent divisiveness in the country over issues of surveillance, of complicity, of violence born of fear, and not see a snapshot of a society &#x2014; not Gotham&#x2019;s fictional one, but our own, real-life one &#x2014; ready to plunge into the abyss of fragmentation, of self-serving chaos. Maybe that&#x2019;s why Nolan&#x2019;s film now feels so poignant. Today, it&#x2019;s hard not to feel that humanity&#x2019;s worst impulses have won, that those without conscience or shame were allowed to sow endless dissension, hatred, and cruelty, using our own sense of guilt against us.</p> </blockquote>

			 <p>So, in one of the <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/indiewebify-blot-site">recent posts</a> on indiewebifying the blot.im site, I was faced with a roadblock.</p> <blockquote> <p>I could not find any way to format the published date that gets displayed on the posts. The post properties exposes just&#xA0;, which gets the default format of <span class="small-caps">MMM</span> <span class="small-caps">DD</span>, <span class="small-caps">YYYY</span>. And I do not think it&#x2019;s a valid ISO-8601 as expected by the microformats2.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, I had reached out to David and apparently there is a <em>yet-to-be-documented</em> way.</p> <p>As per the <a href="https://blot.im/developers/reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official document</a> for developers, the standard way to get the post&#x2019;s publish date is with property <code>{ { date } }</code><a href="#footnote-1HH2" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-1HH2"><sup>1</sup></a>. However, if so inserted, it inserts the date in a default format - <code>MMMM DD, YYYY</code>. Even though it is a format that displays well, it does not provide the complete information on date, up to time level. For the microformats2 <code>dt-published</code> <code>time</code> tag, it is important that the post publish date is inserted as valid ISO-8601. So to do that, just use the below code snippet instead of <code>{ { date } }</code>.</p> <pre><code>{ { # entry } } { { # formatDate } } MM YYYY DD { { /formatDate } } ... { { / entry } }</code></pre> <p>Make sure you remove spaces in between the curly brackets (<em>refer footnote 1</em>). Wherever the snippet <code>{ { # | / formatDate } }</code> is added, it would be replaced by post&#x2019;s publish date in the format defined in between the tags.</p> <p>In David&#x2019;s own words,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>any of <a href="https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moment.js&#x2019; date formatting tokens</a> work (formatDate is basically <a href="https://momentjs.com/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moment.js</a> behind the scenes)&#x201D;. So you should be able to customise it completely as per your need.</p> <section class="footnotes"> <hr /> <ol> <li id="footnote-1HH2"><p>As clarified by David in an earlier <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/blot-open-questions-update">open queries post</a>, there is at this point no way to escape the parsing of the code references for properties that Blot uses. It ends up replacing them with the value. So adding spaces is my way to work around that limitation at this point.<a href="#ref-1HH2" class="footnote-back">&#x21A9;</a></p></li> </ol> </section>

			 <p>Email indeed is the perfect, and oldest, decentralised social network for communication. You do not need a particular platform to be part of it. But that is also what makes it terrible. If you can&#x2019;t control the inlet, it has to flood the house - bring it to stand still.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s the one reason that completely negates all the positives for the e-mail as communications platform. So many smarter people have tried making this a usable system. Alas. No success till now. Getting a decentralised platform up and taking it mainstream with its innate complexities is a huge ask, especially amidst the pull of the simplicity of silos. Just look at mastodon.social.</p> <p>Simplicity matters. I struggled for days explaining to my dad why he need not have a<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>www&#x201D; in his e-mail address. And not have a<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>@&#x201D; while typing in the webaddress for Gmail. After a point, he stopped using e-mail, nudging me every now and then on why I wasn&#x2019;t on Facebook where he could just @ me. Apparently,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>it&#x2019;s a closed silo&#x201D; is not a reason enough.</p>

			 <p>Given the recent focus on the <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/user-discovery-with-microthreads/">working on Micro.threads</a>, I hardly had any spare time for working on exploring Blot. <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/micropub-endpoint-from-the-ground-up">Micropub</a> remains a distant dream. In line with <a href="https://lab.amitgawande.com/update-on-blot-experiment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the first update</a>, I thought the best way to get going would be to IndieWebify the site first.</p> <p>So I took some time out today and started with incorporating the basic principles. Some were addressed without much hiccup. Some have left me with some questions.</p> <ol type="1"> <li>Web Sign In is enabled. However, it did throw a curveball. Given that I already have my primary site active, how can I include <code>rel=me</code> links point to any of the Twitter/Github services? Concern is primary as I cannot link my Twitter/Github profiles to multiple homepage. May have to identify a different unused profile?</li> <li><code>h-card</code> microformat is incorporated; so the site provides information on me now.</li> <li><code>h-entry</code> microformat is added to all the post entries. There is one issue though. I could not find any way to format the published date that gets displayed on the posts. The post properties exposes just <code></code>, which gets the default format of <code>MMM DD, YYYY</code>. And I do not think it&#x2019;s a valid ISO-8601 as expected by the microformats2.</li> </ol> <note> <strong>Update</strong>: I did sort out the way to <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/changing-date-format-blot">format the published date</a>. </note> <p><strong>Stuff to sort out next</strong></p> <ul> <li>Webmentions, both send and receive. I think I may keep this for later. I do not think I want to bring in the interactions at this point</li> <li>Support for different posts types - replies, likes and reposts. I need to be able to add these posts type. However, more I think about it, I come to realise biggest benefit is going to be once Micropub is setup and site is able to send the Webmentions at the least. So even this might take some time.</li> </ul>

The present <span class="small-caps">AI</span> orthodoxy neglects the question- and theory-driven nature of observation and perception. The scientific method illustrates this well. And so does the history of science. After all, many of the most significant scientific discoveries resulted not from reams of data or large amounts of computational power, but from a question or theory. (&#x2026;)</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Computers can be programmed to recognise and attend to certain features of the world&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;which need to be clearly specified and programmed a priori. But they cannot be programmed to make new observations, to ask novel questions or to meaningfully adjust to changing circumstances. The human ability to ask new questions, to generate hypotheses, and to identify and find novelty is unique and not programmable. No statistical procedure allows one to somehow see a mundane, taken-for-granted observation in a radically different and new way. That&#x2019;s where humans come in.</p> </blockquote> <p>The essay is loaded with astute observations and arguments, made me thing. A must read.</p>

			 <p>A nice post. Early this year, I too followed a similar path to take my web and social presence Indie - something that I control. The <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/journal">journal section</a> on my website became the primary destination for microposts. I (selectively) route to Twitter via Micro.blog cross-posting feature. I receive and display all the interactions on the posts from different platforms using webmentions.</p> <p>I make Hugo process and render such microposts differently. It&#x2019;s custom now, and may follow any solution in future. But the intention would be my microposts would exist here.</p> <p>This structure has also lent me the flexibility of the posting interface. My posts, social and long ones, originate from the app that&#x2019;s convenient and relevant at the time of posting. Some originate at Micro.blog iOS app, some at <a href="https://quill.p3k.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quill</a>, most replies and likes directly from Microsub clients (like this one from Monocle) and at times in text editor of my choice (iA Writer, Drafts). And that in itself is a huge benefit.</p> <p>I like ring of<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span><em>social</em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span> subdomain that Dan uses, especially for the reason that it can always act as the destination for my microposts, irrespective of what hosts them. I may explore that.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I had <a href="https://lab.amitgawande.com/update-on-micro-threads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently started</a> working on updating Micro.threads application to focus on discovery, specifically user discovery. My social interactions on the internet have never been dull or frustrated since I joined Micro.blog. And it can largely be attributed to the extremely fine community of users that exists on the platform.</p> <p>However, I had also realised that there were a lot many threads, many interactions that I was missing on, because finding new users was still not easy. Discover section exists, but it helped primarily to get new, interesting posts. There was a major section of the platform which could assist me to ease this problem. And that is people I follow and their posts in my stream.</p> <p>Manton had <a href="http://www.manton.org/2018/07/12/following-users-ui.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently updated</a> the default behaviour of a user profile&#x2019;s<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Following&#x201D; section to display only<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span><em>a list of who someone is following that you aren&#x2019;t following already</em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span>. That itself is a huge improvement in identifying new users. But, for me, that too was a bit troublesome. I wanted to focus not just on the follow status, but the interactions; not just focus on whom someone I already follow, follows, but rather whom they interact with frequently.</p> <p>So it was only just to build a system, first of all for myself that will discover more amazing users that I can follow, that I can interact with and learn from. And so I did.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/_img/user-discovery-microthreads.png" alt="Micro.threads User Discovery"></p> <p>I have been playing around with the user discovery section of Micro.threads. And I think it will help others too. Just <a href="http://microthreads.amitg.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">head over</a> to the Micro.threads -&gt; Discover section and give the application a try. You may find it helpful. You may not. But I think the feedback you share would be useful for me, and hopefully to the community too.</p> <p>I believe this just acts as a placeholder until such discovery features are available in the official app itself. Till then, this would be a playground to identify more ways to discover interesting profiles and threads on Micro.blog.</p> <hr /> <p>I have made some key considerations at this point while developing and rolling this out.</p> <ol type="1"> <li>You will have to sign in with your Micro.blog user id and an app token, which is discarded the moment you log out. I have no intention to maintain any accounts or credentials. I plan to use the <code>/account/signin</code> <span class="small-caps">API</span> from micro.blog in future; for now, app token is the quickest, officially supported way to get going.</li> <li>I haven&#x2019;t optimised the performance of discover algorithm to the fullest. I plan to get that done that gradually.</li> <li>I am inclined to keep the information shown itself improving, and also add more ways to unearth user profiles and threads.This is just a first version that I was satisfied with and could roll out. I am already working on the threads parsing and discovery which I think will get done this weekend itself.</li> <li>I do not think I can get this perfect or can stay focused without the feedback from you all. So, any and every feedback is welcome.</li> </ol>

			 <p>I&#x2019;m planning an experiment. The only way I will consume news for next few days would be via my morning newspaper. I think I will be a bit less burdened by the constant pressure of staying in the know. It is not necessary and introduces a lot many distractions.</p> <p>My hypothesis is with not a need to sought out the news, I would be a tad more focused on the work at hand. The primary source I reach out to for news has been Twitter for some time now. And I had to make that difficult. So I have uninstalled the Twitter client from my iPhone. I intend to use it only as a web app.</p> <p>Pleasantly, this was an insight given by ScreenTime - so the system looks to be working. I pondered on the option to put app limit, but thought it would be better to just get rid of this distraction. And so I did.</p>

			 <p>Thank you Aaron. I am confident the consistency of Aperture will consistently grow with more edge cases covered. On client, I did try all the apps, both on web (Together) and iOS (Indigenous). I found Monocle to be the most stable one. I do not think my primary concerns around posts display are addressed by any. But anyway I will use these apps a bit longer. I want to use this system, really!</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2018/07/13/222400.html">State of Microsub Servers and Client</a></h1>

			 <p>I had recently <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/journal/39619/">expressed</a> an excited opinion on Microsub, the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>new&#x201D; Indieweb spec. I could then see the potential of the standard and also the available solutions, the server and the clients, around it.</p> <blockquote> <p>I have seen Monocle in action now and realise the power of Microsub standard. I do not think I can read feeds in any other manner now. This is fantastic!</p> </blockquote> <p>The fact that there exists a hosted Microsub server in Aperture is a great start, it has given a chance to many to get started knowing the standard early. And I know people like Aaron Parecki <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2018/03/12/17/building-an-indieweb-reader" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are hard at work</a> to continue improving the clients like Monocle. However, I think my excitement was premature.</p> <p>No doubt, the core technology behind Microsub is solid and it can eventually redefine the way feeds are subscribed to and consumed. And bundled with Micropub to post actions of the type <em>like</em>, <em>reply</em>, <em>repost</em> directly to your website right from your reading view makes it absolutely magical.</p> <p>So I don&#x2019;t blame myself that I got excited about the standard seeing the potential of what can be achieved when all these Indieweb standards work seamlessly together. <em>Seamless</em> is the key though. For the last few days, I have been trying to use Monocle as my primary feed reader. Unfortunately, the whole system has some way to go before I actually can. I am just noting down the frustrations I encountered using the system.</p> <ol type="1"> <li>Keeping the read status of the posts in sync is flaky. Many of the posts I have read already are shown again. Some of the posts that should have already popped up are not available for some time. When they finally are, they are available in bulk. If I understand the standard correctly, it is the server at fault here. And it is only a single client involved at this point.</li> <li>Subscribing to feeds with the server is not easy. Not user experience wise, but again in terms of the unreliability of the posts appearing in the stream. At times, there are 0 posts fetched; at other times, there is a bulk of hundreds of posts. It poses a challenge for the client.</li> <li>And to the client. I think we can learn from the available feed readers and focus on the must-have features - which are primarily around showing available posts. Monocle currently cannot be configured to show only the new posts. Filter options are limited. Sorting options are limited. Marking read/unread is unavailable. Subscribing to new feeds is not possible (even though spec has a <code>follow</code> <span class="small-caps">API</span> which I hope Aperture exposes). Few of these might be nitpicking, but they are important when the reference for most new users would be existing feed readers.</li> <li>The concept of Microsub server and client, former for maintaining the feeds and the later for displaying them, sounds great. However, to get people on board, we will need at least one application that does the job of both. Wish Monocle and Aperture were two components of a single application.</li> </ol> <p>I know the standard is still a work in progress, especially the server and client applications. So no doubt there would be some kinks in the working. The intention of this post is in no way to demean the people involved or pinpoint at the failures. My intention is to capture my thoughts on why, even though I want to, I cannot yet use the current applications in place. The standard is making significant headway and I hope I would soon be able to benefit from the system. As Aaron says in his introductory post I referenced above -</p> <blockquote> <p>My goal with this is to use this as my primary online dashboard to follow all kinds of content, as well as being able to interact with the content without leaving the interface.</p> </blockquote> <p>Amen to that. Unfortunately, now is not the right time. So I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/journal/40523/">am back</a> to my search for that perfect feed reading service.</p>

			 <p>I had recently realised the project I had much plan for wasn&#x2019;t updated since sometime back. So much that for an observer it very well looks to be<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span><a href="https://m.b.wiki.eli.li" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potentially defunct</a><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span>. There are many reasons why I couldn&#x2019;t push regular updates to this. Priorities at home and at work just didn&#x2019;t allow me enough time.</p> <p>However, deep down I knew I just wasn&#x2019;t satisfied with what I had achieved. I had a huge list of things that I needed to implement and the effort required I thought was huge. But I just couldn&#x2019;t look at the stagnant progress of this service. I found it useful at multiple times and I know it can be improved so that others do too. So, I have decided to take up the project, small improvements at a time.</p> <p>To start with, all the threads, mainly from posts featured in discover section and Emoji collections, are up to date. Well, <a href="https://micro.blog/manton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@manton</a><span class="push-single"></span><span class="pull-single">&#x2019;</span>s hard at work and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2018/07/06/144546.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has already grown</a> the list of Emoji collections. Well, <em>all the Emoji Collections from Micro.blog <a href="http://amitg.xyz/micro/threads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are available</a> at Micro.threads now</em>. So I (and others) can now get all the recommendations for that one <span class="small-caps">&#x1F355;</span> parlour or one&#x2019;s &#x1F5FA;&#xFE0F;ogue.</p> <p>But there&#x2019;s more. The huge list of limitations I talked about at the top? Yeah, I have decided to start addressing them small updates at a time. Firstly just by noting them down.</p> <ul> <li>Threads concept itself is limited. Currently it takes a post id, fetches the conversation (thread) and then pull out all the links and only show these links as a thread.</li> <li>Creating thread is a mess and so is updating it.</li> <li>No way for external users to generate threads. Keeping threads updated is a chore at this point.</li> </ul> <p>So, I have been back to drawing board, working on the ways I want to address these and present what I have in mind. I have a clear objective with this service. What&#x2019;s to come has already found its place on <a href="http://www.amitg.xyz/micro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the homepage</a>, just as a placeholder for now. I wish I manage to deliver it to my satisfaction, first and fore most. If along the way, it helps the community, well and good.</p> <p>Back to work.</p>

Till now, I have been using <a href="https://github.com/am1t/webpage-micropub-to-github/tree/musings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a custom fork</a> of a endpoint from <a href="https://github.com/voxpelli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pelle Wessman</a> for my Hugo site. It has served me well.</p> <p>However, I always wished if I could get one written specifically for my simple needs. One that I know and understand every part of. Given that I have no endpoint yet for the blot site, this is clear opportunity to create one geared for making this site micropub enabled. Hugo site will address my <em>third-party-posting</em> needs till then. So here&#x2019;s the start. I will capture this journey, of course, here and will keep this updated with progress (<em>I hope</em>). Below are the things at this point that I need to get started.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub#How_to_implement" class="uri" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://indieweb.org/Micropub#How_to_implement</a></li> <li><a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#introduction" class="uri" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#introduction</a></li> <li><a href="http://dropbox-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/moduledoc.html#module-dropbox.dropbox" class="uri" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://dropbox-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/moduledoc.html#module-dropbox.dropbox</a></li> </ul> <p>I want to explore python first as an option to get this implemented.

			 <p><strong>Update:</strong> I had sent these questions to David, the developer behind Blot, on the support email address. And of course, given how gem of a person he is, he did address all of them quickly. I am updating the original post with his responses. This dedication of David makes me love this service even more!</p> <hr /> <p>I have some questions I need to explore and find answers for some issues in using Blot. Just jotting them down for reference. The list may continuously grow and shrink as I find the answers.</p> <ol type="1"> <li>What&#x2019;s going on with <code>\{\{Summary\}\}</code>? I do not think it generates what it says it does -<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>first line&#x201D;. It ignores lines with links, it ignores codes in the line. So what&#x2019;s outputted is something inaccurate.</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p><strong>[David]</strong>: You can override summary in the metadata at the start of a file. If you know a little javascript, you can read the rules for how the summary property is generated automatically.</p> </blockquote> <ol start="2" type="1"> <li>Can we override the behaviour of <code>\{\{title\}\}</code>? It is especially important for title-less posts as currently, the file name gets used by default. You need to explicitly set <code>Title:</code> to blank.</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p><strong>[David]</strong>: You can also override title in the metadata. However, based on what you are trying to do, I&#x2019;d make use of the property. This refers to a markdown or <span class="small-caps">HTML</span> title tag in the file itself. For example:</p> </blockquote> <p></p> <p></p> <ol start="3" type="1"> <li>Point 2 is also important for posts via just the image files. As of now, it adds the image name as the title. I would prefer not the post to have any title at all.</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p><strong>[David]</strong>: I think I have solved this point in #2, please let me know if not.</p> </blockquote> <ol start="4" type="1"> <li>Can we override the behaviour of <code>\{\{\{body\}\}\}</code>? Just want to explore possibility to modify behaviour of URLs of image sources. Currently, relative URLs to <code>blotcdn</code> without scheme are added.</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p><strong>[David]</strong>: No, it is not possible to modify body. Please can you explain what you are trying to do? Would you like Blot to stop uploading your images to blotcdn? You can disable this behaviour on the settings page under Images &gt; Cache and optimize images</p> </blockquote> <ol start="5" type="1"> <li>How can we make reference to any Post parameter in a post? If we include the parameter (for example , it gets converted to the title on build? Can we escape the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>?</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p><strong>[David]</strong>: This is not possible right now, it is a bug, I will fix it. Sorry!</p> </blockquote>

			 <p>Austin Kleon wrote <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2018/05/18/a-bad-equation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a nice article</a> advising creators, especially writers, to not fall prey to a belief frequently floated around -<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>you lose a book for every child&#x201D;.</p> <p>I do not think the fact that such a belief exists is much of a stretch. Being a parent is work, a lot of work. It needs time, time that can be spent on other activities, even productive ones. It needs patience, which again eats into one&#x2019;s own time. Own time where many creative people find their zone, find the space where they can think, they can create. And that is applicable to every creator, not just a writer.</p> <p>Austin&#x2019;s post is a follow-up to <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/michael-chabon-are-kids-the-enemy-of-writing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an account</a> from Michael Chabon of an interaction he had with a fellow experienced writer. He was given this advice, then, to not have any children. Reasoning Chabon was provided, along with examples, was explicit and, as he calls it, brutal.</p> <blockquote> <p>Writing was a practice. The more you wrote, the better a writer you became and the more books you produced. Excellence plus productivity, that was the formula for sustained success, and time was the coefficient of both. Children, the great man said, were notorious thieves of time. Then there was the question of subject matter, settings, experiences; books were hungry things, and if you stayed too long in any one place, they would consume everything and everyone around you. You needed to keep moving, always onward, a literary Masai driving your ravenous herd of novels. Travel, therefore, was a must, and I should take his word for it because he had made a careful study: Traveling with children was the world&#x2019;s biggest pain in the ass.</p> </blockquote> <p>So no doubt, parenting can affect one&#x2019;s ability to create, to write especially if the great writer from Chabon&#x2019;s account is to be believed. And so the belief and advice,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>for each child you lose a book&#x201D; - Kleon calls it a bad equation. He refutes it with his own experience.</p> <blockquote> <p>It&#x2019;s not that my boys magically made me a better person and a better artist, it&#x2019;s that my boys make me want to be a better person and a better artist.<br /> <br /> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Art is too long, and life is too short,&#x201D; wrote Grace Paley.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>There&#x2019;s a lot more to do in life than just writing.&#x201D;</p> </blockquote> <p>That is very well said. But for me personally, I do not believe creativity and parenthood are variables of any rational equation. How one affects the other is multi-dimensional, unlike in an equation. There are cases where parenthood leads to, unearths one&#x2019;s creativity. Kleon gives few examples including A. A. Milne&#x2019;s. And then there are cases where parenthood forces one, lends one the creative energy necessary to complete the story at hand. J. K. Rowling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060421032312/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/biography.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">narrates</a> her experience of the origin of the Harry Potter, a story that was in works for 5 years before her daughter was born (<em>emphasis mine</em>).</p> <blockquote> <p>I knew that full-time teaching, with all the marking and lesson planning, <strong>let alone with a small daughter to care for single-handedly</strong>, would leave me with absolutely no spare time at all. And so I set to work in a kind of frenzy, determined to finish the book and at least try and get it published. Whenever Jessica fell asleep in her pushchair I would dash to the nearest cafe and write like mad. I wrote nearly every evening. Then I had to type the whole thing out myself. Sometimes I actually hated the book, even while I loved it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fascinating that a stuck creation was completed while struggling and juggling the duties of parenthood. So maybe Rowling lost <em>one</em> novel when she became a mother; but that one lost novel gave the world seven new gems.</p> <p>I myself am a father to a daughter. She commands time from me, and she deserves it. Does it mean it eats into some of my writing time? Oh, absolutely. But do I ever regret that lost time? Certainly not. My life has been a lot colourful with my daughter&#x2019;s presence. Every day that I spend with her writes a new story. Few I pen down, some I journal and most remain locked in my heart as memories for my life.</p> <p>I have no qualms in saying that that is one beautiful creation of mine.</p>

			 <p>Every time I read about Google Duplex, there is a sense of uneasiness in me. I just can never put it in words. I am not sure what makes me sceptic about the technology. Is it not a useful technology? Or is it the fact that the technology demoed is just too good, sound too useful to be true? I think it is the later.</p> <p>Google believes in openly demonstrating the things they are working on, the tech they are building. However, they oversell what the tech can achieve; they drumbeat the most ideal scenario without much thought to its ramifications, its pitfalls.</p> <p>John Gruber, as always, again puts it perfectly in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/06/google_demos_duplex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his post</a> on Google Duplex&#x2019;s <a href="https://youtu.be/-qCanuYrR0g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest demo</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>I still think the whole thing feels like a demo of a technology (the human-like speech), not a product. Google claimed this week that Duplex currently succeeds 4 out of 5 times at placing a reservation without a human operator&#x2019;s intervention. That&#x2019;s a good batting average for a demo, but untenable for a shipping product at Google&#x2019;s scale. With a 20 percent failure rate, Google would need an army of human operators standing by all day long, to support a feature they don&#x2019;t make any money from. I&#x2019;m skeptical that this will ever be a product expanded to wide use, and if it is, it might be years away.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Right now it feels like a feature in search of a product, but they pitched it as an imminent product at I/O because it made for a stunning demo.</p> </blockquote> <p>Exactly. That completes my thought&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;it&#x2019;s the tech that Google markets. Tech, not a product, can be marketed and sold is a fallacy that Google, for some reason, continues to believe.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A mystery of murders during a<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Murder and Mayhem week&#x201D;, amid<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>some role-playing and fantasy crime solving&#x201D;. Now that&#x2019;s one juicy premise. Alas, a juicy premise is necessary, but never sufficient after all to make a compelling read.</p> <p>A widower Jane Stewart works as a manager at her ageing great-aunt and -uncle&#x2019;s storybook resort. Things go awry for her when during her planned Murder and Mayhem week, one of her guests is murdered and the book he had won as part of a scavenger hunt is missing. It is now Jane&#x2019;s responsibility - not just as the resort manager, but as a guardian to the treasure the book was part of - to find the real-killer and the missing book.</p> <p>This is such a simple plot that could very well have been penned into a riveting mystery. But it wasn&#x2019;t. I was so close to give up on this books at one moment - actually that was right at the moment it stopped being a murder mystery and veered into at attempted thriller around a treasure trove. Plot is thin. Writing is barely passable. Mystery is poorly narrated. There just isn&#x2019;t enough suspense and urgency to hold the reader&#x2019;s attention. A straight forward story, narrated in an extremely amateurish manner.</p> <p>A word on the writing first, I think the way the book started was pretty promising. Author Ellery Adams did have a nice plot at her hands. However, the way she chose to present it is so unlike a murder mystery typically is. I wasn&#x2019;t involved enough to care for anyone who was dead because the characters just weren&#x2019;t built well. Add to that, a reader was informed, told, that a person was murdered&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;never shown. For that matter, every thing that happens is <em>told</em> to the reader, not <em>shown</em>. And that&#x2019;s where lies the biggest fault of the novel.</p> <p>An inclination from the author to kick start a series by making this much bigger than a simple, cozy murder mystery didn&#x2019;t help either. All it does is introduce a string of unnecessary subplots and a meandering ending that attempts to set ground for books to come.</p> <p>A murder mystery needs a meaty plot, strong characters and succinct narration. Unfortunately, this books fails on all count for me. Jane, the protagonist, doubts at multiple points in the book if she is worthy to be the <em>guardian of a family secret</em>; wishes if she had just been a Resort Manager. I, as a reader, wished the same.</p> <p>My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2417063216" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 of 5 stars</a></p>

			 <p>The more I think and hear from the voices (a lot smarter than I) talk about the rumoured Apple&#x2019;s transition to its in-house chips for Macs, I realise this is going to be way tricker than I initially thought. There are too many variables I failed to think about initially.</p> <p>The <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest <span class="small-caps">ATP</span> episode</a> covers few of them really well. I had to put down my thoughts to appreciate how big a deal this is.</p> <ol type="1"> <li>Transitioning the developers for the Mac is not going to be easy as-is. The lack of earnings from the macOS platform is already a cause of concern for the developers and Apple. Supporting a new chip architecture would be an overhead, irrespective of how easy Apple makes it.</li> <li>Macs are used for developing the software targeted at beyond the Apple platforms. A different chip design just adds another variable to the test-support cycle.</li> <li>It&#x2019;s easier to say Apple will only move the <em>non-pro</em> macs to in-house chips (most probably based on <span class="small-caps">ARM</span> architecture) than to make an <span class="small-caps">OS</span>, already loaded with bugs, to simultaneously support two chip architectures.</li> <li>In a scenario (worst case) of Apple failing to keep up with competitors on performance, will they be ready for another transition? Or are they in this for a long haul, irrespective of what the competition delivers?</li> <li>There is a possibility of the chip design team running low on bandwidth if they are to support two platforms. This can, of course, mean that there won&#x2019;t be deserved attention to the iOS platform &#x2014; the money-earner, hence the more important platform for Apple. Eventually, Mac will get ignored (again!). Another possibility, of course, is Apple just doesn&#x2019;t see two platforms existing simultaneously in its future. And hence the next point.</li> <li>I do not think it is just a coincidence that this rumour is going hand in hand with another rumour around <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Marzipan</a>. I believe there is some close relationship between the two - either as a strategy or as an enabler.</li> </ol> <p>Whatever the truth behind the rumours be, upcoming <span class="small-caps">WWDC</span> promises to be an exciting event. Even if they do not chalk out the whole strategy, would be interesting if we do see any early signs.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2018/04/08/163500.html">Thoughts on The Rule of Links</a></h1>

			 <p>Every post I write oftentimes has a link to an external post, either as a reference or as a recommendation. And every single time, I go through this struggle of deciding which word should carry the link. It was so naive of me to think Dave Winer won&#x2019;t have written about it. Of course, Dave had.</p> <p>He recently <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/07.html#a201519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">linked</a> to his post on<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span><a href="http://bloggercon.scripting.com/ruleoflinks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Rule of Links</a><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Linking is an art. It&#x2019;s a choice. You don&#x2019;t link from every word or even every noun, or from the subject of every sentence. But when a reader reasonably would want to know more about the subject, the Rule of Links says you should link to it.</p> </blockquote> <p>It has to be the word that makes the reader curious with any of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 Ws</a> on the topic. But something that is always pestering me at the back of my mind is what does this link communicate to the search engines. Isn&#x2019;t this link also one of the signals for Google to decide what the outgoing link (the page) is about?</p> <p>So I believe the first link of this post is correct as per Dave&#x2019;s rules of links. However, I don&#x2019;t think that helps a search engine understand the linked page better.</p> <p>It won&#x2019;t be a stretch to think Dave believes a writer shouldn&#x2019;t worry how a search engine reads a post. But given the reality of today&#x2019;s web, one just cannot ignore how a search engine sees your page.</p> <p>Also, I am a bit torn on the below perspective.</p> <blockquote> <p>In the Web, after having visited a link, you can just hit the Back button to regain your context. (An aside, that&#x2019;s why links that open in new windows are non-web-like.)</p> </blockquote> <p>On this site, I do adhere to this principle for all the regular posts. However, for link-posts, I do open the post linked from the title in a new window. I do not create such posts just to share the link &#x2014; for that, I would, well, just share the link on whichever platform. I generally have some comment to make on the post or the section of the post.</p> <p>So in such cases, I assume the reader visiting my site wants to read my commentary. And I do not want to lose her attention by forcing her out to the linked post. If she has already read the post, great. If she hasn&#x2019;t, she can do so in a new tab and then come back to the commentary.</p> <p>Is it really appropriate to open a new tab on a reader&#x2019;s machine just to not lose that reader? No.&#xA0;Shouldn&#x2019;t I trust my writing to pull the reader back even if she gets redirected? Of course, yes. However, given our diminishing attention span amid the growing distracting portals all around, how practical is it to assume she will be back?</p>

			 <p>Time. Those fleeting moments of time. Those crazy, affected attempts to catch up to them. To not let them pass. To slow them down. Those foolish attempts, unsuccessful every time.</p> <p>24 hours. 1440 minutes. 86,400 seconds that dawn with a promise to provide enough <em>time</em> to complete all the tasks unfinished. At work and out of work. To run all the errands. To update all those projects. To finish all those drafts. To pen all those ideas, those thoughts clogging your mind.</p> <p>That dawn with a promise to let you provide attention, dedicated attention to your family. With a promise to let you socialize with those friends, neglected - forgotten even - for the want of <em>time</em>. With a promise to let you make those calls still not made since last week, last month. With a promise to let yourself focus on your health, let you the rest that you dearly need.</p> <p>With a promise to do so much more than there is <em>time</em> for. Till you realise those 24 hours the day dawned with? They just aren&#x2019;t enough. Not enough for everything. Barely enough for something.</p> <p>So you can either spend those fleeting moments on that something, anything. Or get bogged down with the burden of those others things left untouched. Because there&#x2019;s just not enough time.</p>

			 <p>Most tech bloggers often dislike Apple because they tend to stay focused on a theme in an event. They just narrate their story, their perspective of the market they plan to talk about. Nothing more. That provides no juicy sound bytes.</p> <p>Exactly the reason I just didn&#x2019;t follow today&#x2019;s event. Apple wanted it to be low key, there were clear indications.</p> <p>They had informed they specifically want to talk about their, if I may, foray in education. I can&#x2019;t really relate to the use case, so I can&#x2019;t appreciate the worth of what they are going to offer.</p> <p>Did they deliver? Will what they announced help them succeed in the education market? I will leave the judgement to commentators smarter than me.</p> <p>But did they talk about anything else? About anything not part of the announced <em>theme</em>? Of course, not. Tech bloggers tend to hate Apple for that.</p>

The series was level 1-1. Australia still has one of the best new ball attacks there is. They have been playing some good cricket in recent times.

			 <p>I had <a href="http://amitgawande.com/indiewebify-hugo-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently expressed</a> my hope for more people to own their identities online.</p> <blockquote> <p>There is nothing wrong with attempting to control what you post online, to make sure it stays online till you want it to. I do also realise that it is naive to think no one getting online will find this process irksome. Even though well defined, the (<em>open web</em>) principles are not for all. The simplicity of using and posting on social media services will continue to attract regular users. However, here&#x2019;s wishing that at least a part of these users are inspired to get their own personal domain.</p> </blockquote> <p>An innate wish there is that more people would leave the silos behind and get online as themselves, express thoughts that are their own, not mindless reposts and shares, and at the site they control - their blogs<a href="#footnote-1Y07" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-1Y07"><sup>1</sup></a>. At the same time, the hope is the hosting platforms make it simpler to book such places online and get them up and running easily.</p> <p>I think there has already been a huge improvement on this front. There are numerous platforms, like Wordpress, Ghost and others<a href="#footnote-2Y07" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-2Y07"><sup>2</sup></a>, that are making it simpler to get your own blogs up and running. They also allow you to link these blogs to your domain without fussing over hosting/maintenance. The promise is simple. Jump in with a free tier&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;if you are happy and if you want to, just switch to a paid account.</p> <p>But then comes the million dollars question? What&#x2019;s the point if what I write reaches no one? If no one reads it or talks about it? If everyone keeps shouting in the void without anyone listening, one better not spend the energy. After all, we are sociable. We like interactions, we want feedback.</p> <p><span class="small-caps">RSS</span> is a powerful protocol that could have solved this problem. Unfortunately, that&#x2019;s what it remained, a protocol<a href="#footnote-3Y07" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-3Y07"><sup>3</sup></a>. It needed a system to be built on top to gain any traction amongst masses. That&#x2019;s where I believe lies an opportunity for <a href="https://micro.blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micro.blog</a>. It brings in that social layer to the thoughts you pen on your blog.</p> <p>You can either host your content there or get your posts from existing blog to the micro.blog timeline. You write on your blog, it&#x2019;s visible for others on their timeline, just as a tweet or a Facebook post will on their respective siloed timelines.</p> <p>But it doesn&#x2019;t allow repost. It does not glorify numbers of likes and comments and followers.</p> <p>Such behaviours and numbers are the signals for bots to game the machine curation systems. <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/2/19/17020310/tristan-harris-facebook-twitter-humane-tech-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tristan Harris</a> put this very well during one of his podcasts appearances.</p> <blockquote> <p>Outrage just spreads faster than something that&#x2019;s not outrage.<br /> <br /> When you open up the blue Facebook icon, you&#x2019;re activating the <span class="small-caps">AI</span>, which tries to figure out the perfect thing it can show you that&#x2019;ll engage you. It doesn&#x2019;t have any intelligence, except figuring out what gets the most clicks. The outrage stuff gets the most clicks, so it puts that at the top.</p> </blockquote> <p>So what do we do then? As Don MacDonald pondered in one of his posts, <a href="http://donmacdonald.com/2018/02/is-sharing-bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is sharing a problem</a>? Shall we just stop sharing?</p> <p>I doubt that will be effective. It will work when <em>we</em> make it work. We need to take control of what gets presented to us to consume. It cannot be done by a corporate inclined primarily first to maximise its margins. It cannot be done by an algorithm that&#x2019;s designed to gallop every signal and spit a feed to maximise engagement.</p> <p>Once we start consuming, reading, healthy, we will think healthy. And we should think. And share, and respond we should. Let&#x2019;s just make sure it is a space that represents us. A space that one can point to and say that&#x2019;s my thoughts in there. My social presence, a signature. Let open web be that space.</p> <section class="footnotes"> <hr /> <ol> <li id="footnote-1Y07"><p>I use blog and site interchangeably throughout this article.

Superhero films are supposed to be fun, not some dark societal commentary.</p> <p>And Spider-Man finally gets a perfect film &#x2014; one that lets him be a learning bumbling powerful goodhearted teen.</p>

			 <p>I guess the attempt from Apple to market HomePod as a speaker-first-smart-later device didn&#x2019;t work. All I see is people complaining about how Siri sucks.

			 <p>This is such a feel-good post to cheer one up on how a town in Somerset realised the ill effects of loneliness, isolation had and combated the perceived causes head-on.</p> <blockquote> <p>The Compassionate Frome project was launched in 2013 by Helen Kingston, a <span class="small-caps">GP</span> there. She kept encountering patients who seemed defeated by the medicalisation of their lives: treated as if they were a cluster of symptoms rather than a human being who happened to have health problems. Staff at her practice were stressed and dejected by what she calls<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>silo working&#x201D;.<br /> <br /> So, with the help of the <span class="small-caps">NHS</span> group Health Connections Mendip and the town council, her practice set up a directory of agencies and community groups.</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, the effects were obvious, there to be seen for all.</p> <blockquote> <p>Helen Kingston reports that patients who once asked,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>What are you going to do about my problem?&#x201D; now tell her,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>This is what I&#x2019;m thinking of doing next.&#x201D; They are, in other words, no longer a set of symptoms, but people with agency.</p> </blockquote> <p>This really made me stop and ponder on where we, as community, have reached. I remember way early in my schooling days I was taught that human is a social animal. Slowly amidst the hustle of the life, driven may be by an overly cynical narrative floating all-around, the definition of being <em>social</em> has completely changed.</p> <p>I remember when I was living with my parents, we used to plan visits to all our friends and relatives when they were not doing well. I used to question then why should you add misery to their already miserable state by being there and making them host guests. My grandfather had explained once,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>They are down, and they need people around them to lift them up&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;more mentally than physically. Hospitals are only paid to take care of the later. It&#x2019;s the former that is equally necessary and effective.&#x201D;</p> <p>I feel we are being deliberately obtuse to not understand that a dull, shallow<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>get well soon&#x201D; message rarely affects. Agree, it may lend a moment of tickle. But it is the social <em>contact</em> that has a chance to heal one completely, not a social message.</p>

			 <p>In continuation to my wish for the <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/journal/11366/">publications to allow subscribing only to their exclusive</a> content, I have realised even the curators and aggregators are struggling with this scale. It&#x2019;s become tiring to dig through the pile of garbage.</p>

			 <p>Every time I attempt to read any publication, I am bomabarded with the content marked<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Exclusive&#x201D; which rarely is exclusive. Many publications just regurgitate the same news and reports.</p> <p>There was a time I could just fetch opinion/edits &#x2014; there existsed even special feeds for such. Most well known media and news publication houses had different sections for their exclusive contents. <em>Their</em> voices, <em>their</em> interviews, <em>their</em> exclusive reports. Now try to find even a <span class="small-caps">RSS</span> feed for any of the big portals out there.</p> <p>We are just pointed to their Twitter or Facebook accounts, which are useless because every update to their portal goes on their social media timeline. What&#x2019;s the point of every account screaming that we have a new Samsung Galaxy <span class="small-caps">S9</span> out now?</p> <p>Ironically, it is especially bad for tech portals. We would believe they would know better - have clearly marked <span class="small-caps">RSS</span> feeds or social media accounts. Nope. Rarely do any of them have exclusives, most of the times content marked as such is a planned <span class="small-caps">PR</span> play from some company.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Exclusive: A walk through <span class="small-caps">XYZ</span> testing facility&#x201D;.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Special: Interview with head of&#xA0;..&#x201D;. All these are just planted stuff, nothing new to tell.</p> <p>I just hope we go back to the days when exclusives actually meant something. And also a wish that portals did separate their original content from the regular news storm. A separate feed (or even twitter account, for that matter) for your exclusives stories would be a good start.</p>

			 <p>The world is full of fascinating minds, with a stream of curious thoughts trickling onto the web - day in day out. I came across <a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/2018/your-version-number/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another one</a> today by <a href="https://micro.blog/jthingelstad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamie Thingelstad</a>, a version number for oneself.</p> <p>Yes, this makes total sense to me. A decade is indeed a major version&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;a chance to reclaim oneself, it&#x2019;s ok then if it breaks a few of the regularities that worked for you, and for others, earlier. Your routine, your habits. Your likes and your dislikes. Your looks change, so do your thoughts. It&#x2019;s new you. Hopefully one who is a better, more mature, more compatible than your last major version.</p> <p>Every birthday is a minor version up. You attempt to change, just a bit. You are forced to change by the surroundings, just that bit more. But the changes aren&#x2019;t groundbreaking. They are minor. You are still the <em>same you</em>. With more or less the same maturity and compatibility as your last minor version.</p> <p>Each day hardly changes anything significant. You patch anything that was amiss yesterday. If everything went well, you just glide along the same. And of course, you do not want there to be a need for too many patches, just more regular stuff. So, a version increment, without too many broken things.</p> <p>Is this analogy with <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semantic Versioning</a> perfect? Of course, not - it breaks if we go into the nitty-gritty details. But that&#x2019;s not the point.</p> <p>If we live our life with a hope and an attempt that every patch version fixes something broken, every minor version changes some things for better and every major version brings in more maturity, more compatibility, I think we would lead a satisfying life.</p> <p>v3.3.162 Release Notes</p>

The web does not belong to them. Defend the web. The answer to Google is no.</p> </blockquote> <p>I am torn on this. On one hand, I absolutely hate that Google wants every website owner to go through the hassle of obtaining certificates and enabling https &#x2014; even if it&#x2019;s a plain simple text blog. But on the other hand, I realise that it&#x2019;s too much to expect that regular users understand the technicalities of which sites <em>have to be</em> secure and which are ok if they are not.</p> <p>Making all sites secure will shift the onus to the site owners rather than the readers. Those who know how to, will find a way to do so. Those who don&#x2019;t are hopefully with platforms, like Wordpress, that are making it simple to enable https. It can&#x2019;t be a loss for anyone, can it?</p>

			 <p>Ben Thompson of Stratechery has published a (another) great post on understanding <span class="small-caps">AMP</span> and the reasons behind its lure for publishers and success amongst users on web. It&#x2019;s a must read to better understand how (and why) Google is aggressively pushing <span class="small-caps">AMP</span> across its product lines.</p> <p>And of course, he also talks about the core argument against <span class="small-caps">AMP</span> - it&#x2019;s an open, but still a proprietary standard from Google. And they are blatantly exploiting their monopoly in search and online advertising while promoting it.</p> <blockquote> <p>The problem with Google&#x2019;s actions should be obvious: the company is leveraging its monopoly in search to push the <span class="small-caps">AMP</span> format, and the company is leveraging its dominant position in browsers to punish sites with bad ads. That seems bad!<br /> <br /> There is no better example than Google&#x2019;s actions with <span class="small-caps">AMP</span> and Chrome ad-blocking: Google is quite explicitly dictating exactly how it is its suppliers will access its customers, and it is hard to argue that the experience is not significantly better because of it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yes, clearly Google wants to improve the end user experience by giving them a<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>better, leaner web&#x201D; with <span class="small-caps">AMP</span>. Are they being monopolistic along the way? Definitely. Uncompetitive? Absolutely.</p> <blockquote> <p>What happens when protecting consumer welfare requires acting uncompetitively?</p> </blockquote> <p>Now that&#x2019;s a loaded question &#x2014; given that web is spoilt deeply with horrific and utter garbage ads spewed across, what other options remain than such hardball tactics?</p> <p>I do not believe there is a convincing answer to that yet. I am sure the proponents of the open web, myself included, simply do not like Google&#x2019;s utter disregard for standards in <span class="small-caps">AMP</span>. There are <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13414570" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">abundance</a> of examples/opinions on <a href="https://80x24.net/post/the-problem-with-amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">problems with <span class="small-caps">AMP</span></a>.</p> <p>What&#x2019;s worrisome for me though is the fact that Google is markedly focused on elevating <span class="small-caps">AMP</span><span class="push-single"></span><span class="pull-single">&#x2019;</span>s experience on its own browser and in its own search. What if this experience of the web served by Google&#x2019;s platforms turns so much better that eventually that becomes the only web user know of?</p>

			 <p>I recently read <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/i-have-forgotten-how-toread/article37921379/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a great essay</a> by Michael Harris where he dwells into his present-day struggles to read patiently, <em>the old way</em>. With focus.</p> <blockquote> <p>Paragraphs swirled; sentences snapped like twigs; and sentiments bled out. The usual, these days. I drag my vision across the page and process little. Half an hour later, I throw down the book and watch some Netflix.</p> </blockquote> <p>I completely empathise with this. I had realised early last year how difficult it had become for me to read, surrounded by the all-time connected gadgets. A ping here. A notification there. And out I was from my reading flow. Into the swirl of unnecessary, untimely, inconsequential<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>information&#x201D; blurbs. What followed was a tap-swipe-scan-stare routine through the varied app icons scattered across the screen. Away from the book, the narrative.</p> <p>That was also the time when I realised something had to change. First of all, the underserving notifications <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/journal/purge-undeserving-notifications/">had to be purged</a>.</p> <p>Second, I had to start reading in a place where I am not surrounded by any connected device. So I take my kindle, walk to my balcony or to my terrace or to the garden and settle there. Without my phone. Or my iPad. Anyone needs my attention, they have to come fetch me. And I realised I was back to being more earnest while reading. Reading more regularly, speedily. Reading more. Period.</p> <p>And it indeed is important that I read more for me. I realised the slackness in reading also affected my ability to pen words. I stopped writing. I knew the reason, but Michael puts it perfectly.</p> <blockquote> <p>In Silicon Valley, they have a saying that explains why an algorithm starts producing unwanted results: Garbage in, garbage out. The idea is that an algorithm can only work with the information you feed it. Aren&#x2019;t writers&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;all creators&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;algorithmic in that way? Our job is to process what we consume. Beauty in, beauty out. Garbage in, garbage out.<br /> <br /> So maybe that change into a cynical writer can be forestalled&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;if I can first correct my reading diet, remember how to read the way I once did. Not scan, not share, not excerpt&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;but read. Patiently, slowly, uselessly.</p> </blockquote> <p>I just couldn&#x2019;t agree more. Fortunately or unfortunately, we are stuck in this information world. There is no steering clear of the frivolous interruptions we are assailed with from all sides. All I want is to pluck the opportunities I grant others to interrupt me.</p>

			 <p>Notifications are distractions, but they don&#x2019;t have to be &#x2014; it calls for an aggressive behaviour on user&#x2019;s part to manage them. Any app that needs my attention first has to convince me that it is worthy of that. It has to convince me that it deserves the right to break into my life, to barge into whatever am doing and make me acknowledge what it has to say.</p> <p>What that means is no new app gets a default<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Yes&#x201D; from me for its<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Enable Notifications&#x201D; prompt. <em>They are always disabled first.</em> (Same applies to my privacy too. No app gets access to my location, even while running, or my photos or my contacts. No, <em>always a no.</em>)</p> <p>Every app, at least on iOS, clearly communicates why it needs that privilege - by prompting at appropriate time, during an appropriate task. It is then that I make the call if that cause is indeed genuine.</p> <p>And then there are those apps that make me anxious for their notifications, for some instant gratification they deliver (e.g.&#xA0;social media likes). I have realised one thing - these apps should not be allowed to light up my screen or vibrate in my pocket. Because valuable minutes and hours are lost in checking if they indeed have lighten up. It also grants me another incentive to access the app and follow what&#x2019;s going on there. <em>Of course, on my own terms this time</em>.</p> <p>Attention is a valuable asset, acquired with extreme difficulty, one that costs dearly to regain when lost. That device in your pocket is there to assist you, to save you time. Don&#x2019;t let it steal this asset throughout the day.</p>

			 <p>I have always believed that anyone can write. Life throws at us many opportunities to express ourselves in words&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;something short or long, in public or in private. It is incumbent on us to grab the chance.</p> <p><a href="https://micro.blog/colinwalker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin Walker</a> had <a href="https://colinwalker.blog/explanations-and-lessons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expressed</a> a similar sentiment while summarising his lessons from his Write365 challenge.</p> <blockquote> <p>What does matter is that we communicate, that we share, that we express ourselves so that others can understand. What does matter is that we don&#x2019;t isolate ourselves behind a wall of silence.<br /> <br /> Writing is a starting point, a first step on a much longer path.<br /> <br /> We should all write.</p> </blockquote> <p>I completely agree with Colin, each one of us should write. This also reminds me of a post I had written arguing everyone can write&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;all it takes is a will and belief in oneself. Following is an excerpt from that post.</p> <hr /> <p>One way to think of writing is to jot down abundance of words, leading towards a story or an account. Another way is to simply think of it as expressing oneself. Every person often comes across such occasions to put his thought, his ideas, his expressions in words. Occasions are aplenty. Event in his own life. Event in the lives of acquaintances, friends or near &amp; dear ones. Or just a public event.</p> <p>One of my friends had a similar occasion, one close to his heart. It was anniversary of his engagement with his fianc&#xE9;, theirs 1st. He took all the pains to decide on the gift, the place to buy it from, flowers to go with it and the time to be delivered at. And then he did what I see people doing most often. He went to google and typed<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>1st anniversary wishes/messages&#x201D;. I wondered why did he not just scribble what he felt?</p> <p>It&#x2019;s saddening to see people resist the efforts to pen the words they think of. They go after what others have written, beautifully never-the-less, but at the cost of it being not real, fake. They underestimate the power of conveying one&#x2019;s own feelings in whichever way possible. The words, their structure won&#x2019;t matter much then. And that is one way one can start writing.</p> <p>Don&#x2019;t miss a chance to write to your loved ones, breed a will to do so. Wish them, appreciate them, console them. Keep it simple, write the words you feel. Take effort to make it personal, involving.</p> <p>And finally, have belief in yourself.</p> <blockquote> <p>And by the way, everything in life is writable about if you have the outgoing guts to do it, and the imagination to improvise. The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt.<br /> <br /> -Sylvia Plath</p> </blockquote> <p>So next time you get an occasion to wish someone, don&#x2019;t doubt yourself. Start writing. Express.</p>

			 <p>A receding hairline poses a lot of annoyance for the owner of one. And I won&#x2019;t even get into how painful it is to watch your forehead span further into your scalp with each passing day. That&#x2019;s manageable. It&#x2019;s the juggling act that gets played out everyday on your head that is crazy.</p> <p>The remaining soldiers battling at fore-front start behaving like sore losers, running helter-skelter. But they are also wired for a sole task to cover the scalp, so they keep curling and furling all over the deserting scalp. Of course, failing terribly at their attempt to cover it to any convenient extent.</p> <p>The dearth of much competition also makes every individual&#x2019;s development feel brisk, the troop growing <em>longer rather than denser</em>. Given there remain very few of them, they get caressed more by the owner, pulling few out every time they are.</p> <p>What this leaves behind is a scene akin to a movie theatre playing any recent M. Night Shyamalan movie. Very few that matter occupying the seats, scattered, with tons of empty spaces peeping all across.</p>

<p>For many, that’s too much of jargon right there in the title. So to a bit of basics first.

<p>Ever since I built this site, I had grown pretty determined to styling this exactly to my liking. Every section in here is thought through and has a purpose. When I was happy with what I had at the core, I started exploring how to make this my primary identity online. I had realised that thanks to all the silos of Facebook, Twitter, Medium, et al., my online presence was scattered across multiple sites. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://indieweb.org" target="_blank">IndieWeb</a> calls it <span class="pull-double">“</span><em>sharecropping your content</em><span class="pull-double">”</span>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Our online content and identities are becoming more important and sometimes even critical to our lives. Neither are secure in the hands of random ephemeral startups or big silos. We should be the holders of our online presence.</p><p>When you post something on the web, it should belong to you, not a corporation. Too many companies have gone out of business and lost all of their users’ data. By joining the IndieWeb, your content stays yours and in your control.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, absolutely. I just couldn’t stop nodding my head in agreement as I read along. I want this site to be the primary place where my content exists. And I hope everyone spending time online, doing as basic a task as consuming content on social media and liking stuff there, should do so first primarily on a place he controls. Post on your website, syndicate it everywhere else<a id="ref-1PHF" class="footnote-ref" href="#footnote-1PHF"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it doesn’t take much to enable this. The steps I mention below can be incorporated on any platform you base your site on. Here I specifically jot down the steps I did for my site. It’s just a set of principles, many of them already <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="small-caps">W3C</span> Recommendations</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="hugo-basics">Hugo Basics</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hugo allows you to completely define how your website is structured and styled. It allows you to even define the behaviour of the pages across. Typically a user chooses a theme from a varied selection and lets it handle everything. However, you always have access to the theme files and the code — just some Go snippets spread across HTML pages, making it fairly simple to modify the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"type":"1"} -->
<ol type="1"><li>Familiarise yourself with your theme, typically present in <code><site_root>/themes/<theme_name></code></li><li>Identify the customisations made</li><li>Make changes to the code, typically present either in <code>layouts</code> folder of your site or the theme</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="web-sign-in-via-indieauth">Web Sign-in via IndieAuth</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first step in owning your identity online is allowing your site to be your identity online. All these needs is to declare openly your social network profiles as <code>rel-me</code> links and link those profiles back to your site. This allows you to log in to any IndieAuth enabled websites using just your website homepage, no need to create an account or maintain more passwords.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For me, I already had links to my social network profiles in my <code>/layouts/partials/header.html</code> file. All I had to do was add a <code>rel-me</code> tag to it — a sample snippet to Twitter profile below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:code -->
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">a</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">data-hint</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Twitter&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">title</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Twitter&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;{{ . }}&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">target</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;_blank&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">rel</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;me&#34;</span>&gt; 
      ... 
&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">a</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have selected Twitter and Github as the social network profiles to be used for identification.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You also need to declare the service which will act as an <code>authorization endpoint</code> when needed. This is used by other services, mostly IndieAuth clients, to validate your identity. To configure this, just add the below link to your site’s <code>head</code>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">pre</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;wp-block-code&#34;</span>&gt;&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">code</span>&gt;&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">link</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">rel</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;authorization_endpoint&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://indieauth.com/auth&#34;</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="identity-via-h-card">Identity via h-card</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, once you decide your site will be your identity, your profile online, you need to make sure it clearly declares your basic information, i.e. define that identity. This allows other sites and services to know more about you. This is done via an <code>h-card</code>, a part of the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2#h-card" target="_blank">microformats2</a> specification.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>This way your social networks are not ones that define your identity, rather it is you who declare and control it.</p>

<h2 id="content-definition-with-microformats">Content definition with microformats</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After defining yourself, the next step is to define your content. It is important for other sites and services to not just identify you, but your content too. Just add an <code>h-entry</code> markup (again part of microformats2 specification) to the posts template. This is possible by identifying the layouts that handle your posts and adding some markups to it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had to modify the <code>/layouts/partials/post-header.html</code>, <code>/layouts/partials/post-content.html</code> and <code>/layouts/post/single.html</code>. The information I declare is post title (<code>p-name</code>), post URL (<code>u-url</code>), author (<code>p-author</code>), date (<code>dt-published</code>) and, of course, the content (<code>e-content</code>). Finally, a typical post template looks as below.</p>

<h2 id="cross-site-conversations-via-webmentions">Cross-site conversations via Webmentions</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the steps done till now allow defining your and your content’s identity for external websites. However, how do you enable conservations with them? If enabled, every time you or your website is referenced online, if they are IndieWeb Level 2 enabled, you are notified by Webmentions, another <span class="small-caps">W3C</span> Recommendation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Webmention is a simple way to automatically notify any <span class="small-caps">URL</span> when you link to it on your site. From the receivers perspective, it’s a way to request notification when other sites link to it.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In short, it is a modern alternative to erstwhile Pingback mechanism in prime blogging days. Of course, you have to enable your site to both send and receive web mentions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To send a webmention to the page you have referenced, you can notify by</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>using a form made available on the referenced page</li><li>using curl or one of the many open-source clients</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the referenced site can receive webmentions, they would be notified that you have linked to them. But how do you enable your site to receive web mention?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, it involves hosting and declaring a webmention endpoint. Of course, the active community already has a ready solution for this - <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://webmention.io" target="_blank">webmention.io</a> by <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://voxpelli.com" target="_blank">Pelle Wessman</a>. It is <span class="pull-double">“</span>a hosted service created to easily handle webmentions”. All you have to do is sign in with your domain (i.e. validate your identity) and let webmention.io receive all mentions to your site. Once that’s done, just declare the web mention endpoint as below in your <code>head</code>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">link</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">rel</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;webmention&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://webmention.io/username/webmention&#34;</span> /&gt;
</code></pre></div><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Webmention.io also provides APIs for you to fetch the webmentions to your content/site. You can implement your own solution for fetching and displaying these mentions along with posts. I have a simple Javascript to fetch and display them with posts — this is still a work in progress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="interactions-from-social-media">Interactions from Social Media</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though references to your posts from IndieWeb sites are handled, what about the references made on Twitter or Facebook? It can be in any form of response (i.e. likes, retweets/reposts) to the syndicated post. Of course, they do not send webmentions (wish they did).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One option is to implement your own <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://indieweb.org/backfeed" target="_blank">backfeed</a> to poll for such interactions and handle them as a response. Well, of course, the community has made sure there is a simpler hosted option. Enter <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://indieweb.org/Bridgy" target="_blank">Bridgy</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Bridgy is an open source project and proxy that implements backfeed and <span class="small-caps">POSSE</span> as a service. Bridgy sends webmentions for comments, likes, etc. on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, and Flickr.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was set — now, every time there is interaction about my post on a service, bridgy captures that and sends a webmention to my endpoint.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="one-more-thing---micropub">One More Thing - Micropub</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At this point, I had completely IndieWebified this site. I understand it might get overwhelming if you read it as a long sequence of steps. But trust me, the changes to be made are neither too many nor too complicated. It is just setting your site with appropriate markups and endpoints. There is also a really helpful guide in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://indiewebify.me/" target="_blank">IndieWebify.me</a> that walks you through every step, and also validates if you have everything set up correctly. But if you still do not want to go through the trouble, I have <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/am1t/ghostwriter" target="_blank">open sourced</a> the changes I made to the theme I was using. You can use this theme, style it as per your liking, if needed, and get going.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For me though, there was one more thing pending. At the same time I was doing setting this up, <a href="https://micro.blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">micro.blog</a> had caught my attention. I already had <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/journal">a section</a> dedicated for the microposts. I configured a feed for these posts, the microblogs, to syndicate to my micro.blog timeline too. I was enjoying the interactions I was being part of with the community there<a id="ref-2PHF" class="footnote-ref" href="#footnote-2PHF"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was just one issue, I could not use it to post to my site. My process to post to this site still involved text editors and git commits. I wish it was simpler<br> — at least for such microblogs. I wish I could just <em>post</em> from micro.blog and have an entry made. Enter <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micropub</a>, again another <span class="small-caps">W3C</span> Recommendation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is the trickiest part of the puzzle. Again it involves creating an endpoint which can accept a request to post, verify that it is coming from an authorised source and finally create the post file in required structure for Hugo to build and deploy. I have enabled the support for Micropub on this site, thanks again to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://voxpelli.com" target="_blank">Paul</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would like to detail out the solution I have running. But that would be a topic for another detailed post. In short, I hosted Paul’s open-source <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/am1t/webpage-micropub-to-github" target="_blank">micropub endpoint</a><a id="ref-3PHF" class="footnote-ref" href="#footnote-3PHF"><sup>3</sup></a>, configured it to generate the post in the format I need, configured it to commit to my website source at GitHub, declared it as my site’s micropub endpoint and then let Netlify handle the rest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You bet I would say it was all simple. I won’t.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have realised that the idea of owning your identity online is a crucial facet of protecting yourself and your content in this fragile, siloed world of internet. It may be perceived as ostentatious by many, but it is rather humble, driven by a virtuous intent. There is nothing wrong in attempting to control what you post online, to make sure it stays online till you want it to. IndieWeb project allows that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I do also realise that it is naive to think no one getting online will find this process irksome. Even though well defined, the principles are not for all. The simplicity of using and posting on social media services will continue to attract regular users<a id="ref-4PHF" class="footnote-ref" href="#footnote-4PHF"><sup>4</sup></a>. However, here’s wishing that at least a part of these users are inspired to get their own personal domain. After all, it’s the first step in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://indieweb.org/Getting_Started#Get_a_personal_domain" target="_blank">getting started</a> on this IndieWeb journey.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Update (<span style="color:#999999" class="has-inline-color">23rd September 2020</span>):</strong> Updated the post to clarify the site has been moved recently to WordPress.</p>

The reason I smartened up my house was to find out whether it would betray me.</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, Kashmir&#x2019;s being extremely daring (which she is known to be) to open her (and her family&#x2019;s) life up to be monitored and analysed to such levels. And of course, there are some key findings, some already known (but still appalling), some new. Here are my few key observations.</p> <ol type="1"> <li>Smart devices are still terrible to setup and keep up. It&#x2019;s a technology of future, no doubt.

It is a broken bridge with silos all over the place.</li> <li>Majority of the makers of appliances are still dependent on external, barely known solution providers for adding <em>smarts</em>. Dado Labs? Seriously?</li> <li>None of the smart home devices follow any principles around handling the privacy and security of the data they engulf.

			 <p>Brent Simmons wrote <a href="http://inessential.com/2018/02/01/why_micro_blog_is_not_another_app_net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a great post</a> on why micro.blog is not another App.net. And I completely agree with him. I do want to add a couple of aspects which I believe lends it a better chance to succeed.</p> <p>Brent has clearly articulated on why micro.blog is different, especially the key parts below.</p> <blockquote> <p>And so everyone who follows me on Micro.blog sees my blog posts, and I see theirs. Simple.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>And anyone who wants to could just read my blog in an <span class="small-caps">RSS</span> reader instead. All good, all open.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>If the web is a river, Micro.blog is water, where Twitter and Facebook are dams.</p> </blockquote> <p>I believe that is also where lies the biggest differentiator for micro.blog. After all, the posts are on one&#x2019;s personal website too (I would say they exists primarily on the website first). Not locked in some silo. So in way, micro.blog acts as a feed reader for people to discover and follow posts. With an added layer of interaction around them. Every aspect based on open <a href="http://indieweb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieWeb</a> principles. Of course, I am oversimplifying, but it makes it analogous to how people have understood web.</p> <p>An additional aspect that I think @brentsimmons did not extend the argument to is around adoption. For any platform to succeed it is important that a community of entusiastic adopters join. More importantly, they stay actively involved in using and improving the platform. I think with app.net this aspect was clearly missing &#x2014; it managed to address the first, but it just couldn&#x2019;t be different enough from Twitter to take care of later. So it had many users, but hardly any active ones. Eventually, it got crushed under the networking effect of Twitter.</p> <p>I believe that is not the case with Micro.blog. Fact that one can continue to write on his own website and still be involved in the platform for interaction just makes it a good sell &#x2014; especially for the proponents of open web like me. We are already seeing the early signs of that &#x2014; the community is building up, staying active and involved. And it keeps growing (with more prominent developers joining in). So here&#x2019;s hoping we would finally have all that was good in 2000&#x2019;s web, adopted for consumption habit of 2018.</p> <p>#micro.blog #opinion</p>

			 <p>Steven Sinofsky, in response to an interesting (and hopefully promising) <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-0b369948-3160-4dc1-92bf-a1d90cc0d44a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">note</a> from Axios, again <a href="https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/958874037081456640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised</a> the long debated point.</p> <blockquote> <p>Adding touch to <span class="small-caps">OS</span> X would bound to be disappointing. Plenty examples of this challenge. Ultimately the use case for touch on legacy desktop <span class="small-caps">OS</span> is minimal. <span class="small-caps">BUT</span> you can&#x2019;t run iOS without touch and it remains a huge challenge to have a multi-modal <span class="small-caps">API</span>..</p> </blockquote> <p>I have always been on the side of touch being useless on desktops/laptops. But proponents of this feature have disagreed, putting forth many justifications and success stories, even if anecdotal, with Windows 10 Ultrabooks. Even though I am rarely convinced, I can appreciate how touch can come handy for some activities - mainly clicks and scrolls &#x2014; especially since iPad with Bluetooth keyboard nullified benefits of laptops in some situations for me.</p> <p>I believe the request from the proponents to Apple is to not make a decision for the end user, not attempt to identify purpose for, or lack thereof, touch. <em>Put it in, let users benefit if they think they can.</em> Unfortunately, I do not think Apple ever introduces an interface to a platform without their justification for and user story behind it.</p>

			 <p>On one of the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/rd/69" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent episodes</a> of<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Reconcilable Differences&#x201D;, <a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Siracusa</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Merlin Mann</a> had an interesting conversation on who would make them feel starstruck. Especially they wondered -</p> <blockquote> <p>Who do you wish you could meet and why? What would you say to Steve Jobs in an elevator or Bill Murray on a plane?</p> </blockquote> <p>And of course, that sent my mind on a drive. Who would I want to meet? I think one big factor deciding that would be for whom meeting me will not be a burden. It clearly rules out all the musicians, tired of all the ad-hoc post-show crooning requests. It rules out most of the sports celebrities, already tired, looking out for relaxation. Film celebrities, a complete no.</p> <p>I think people I would be most comfortable meeting would be the ones not too big of celebrities, but well respected in what they do &#x2014; ones whom I admire for what they are and how they conduct themselves.</p> <p>Podcasters, writers are of course high on that list. Anyway, here goes a short list, those I just want to convey I respect them.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Siracusa</a> &#x2014; I think the meet may make him awkward, but I admire him for his clarity of thought and his expertise to put that in words.</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/leolaporte" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leo Laporte</a> &#x2014; One of the most fun, but equally knowledgable voices I listen to. I admire him for how effortlessly he hosts any topic of discussion. Experience does matter.</p></li> <li><p>Published writers to whom I just want to convey how unique and different perspective they have to the world around - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6485178.Fredrik_Backman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fredrik Backman</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16218.Christopher_Moore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christopher Moore</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/569.Khaled_Hosseini" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Khaled Hosseini</a></p></li> <li><p>Some creative writers I follow on Medium - <a href="https://twitter.com/lizellaprescott" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lizella Prescott</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@nicolewillson?source=linkShare-6809a28c41a0-1517426081" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Willson</a></p></li> <li><p>And those I wish I just had even a selfie with - Roger Federer, Sachin Tendulkar, Steve Jobs, Terry Pratchett.</p></li> </ul> <p>I don&#x2019;t think this is a complete list. Rather I believe it would be difficult to put such an extensive list out. Anyway, the least I would do if I ever run into any of the folks I respect is to not make them feel awkward.</p>

Can we talk?&#x201D;</p> <p>Ninad was having the time of his life, making prank calls from the comfort of his room. The rotary dial telephone had been his entertainment hub for the last few hours now. But things were about to change for the worse.</p> <hr /> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Need a single-bed room for today,&#x201D; Ninad ordered the receptionist. He was exploring the morbid looking hotel lobby, still unsure of whether it really was a hotel. It was a small hut with utter lack of air, heat or light. But it did display fancy looking furniture and sculptures. Well kept, tidy.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Wokovu homely heritage resort,&#x201D; it had announced itself at the side of the highway. He still wondered if selecting the hotel just by its peculiar name was a right decision.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Sure sir. And I assume it would be just you alone?&#x201D; Ninad looked around and sighed, but then nodded, not really amused by the gratuitous insult.</p> <p>The receptionist was right in a way. He was alone and stuck. The stormy weather outside didn&#x2019;t leave him much choice to roam outside too. Not that the town had anything worth exploring. Even Google had struggled to pin it on its map.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>So, what amenities do you have?&#x201D; Ninad inquired curiously.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>And what&#x2019;s Wokovu?&#x201D;</p> <p>The receptionist looked up at him, for the first time that Ninad could recall.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Nothing. And we are proud of that. It gives you time to spend time with yourself, for yourself. Frees you of your day-to-day burdens and distractions. Wokovu.&#x201D;</p> <p>Ninad forced a smile on his face, nodding.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Sure.&#x201D; The sarcasm in his tone wasn&#x2019;t lost on the receptionist too.</p> <p>All the plans Ninad had for the day were cancelled, thanks to the terrible storm that had cordoned off the small town, closing off all the roads leading out. There was no way either for Ninad to leave this rotten place or for his colleagues to arrive. He now had to find ways to entertain himself in this so-called resort.</p> <hr /> <p>There was a silence on the line for some time. Ninad wondered if the phone had given up and died with age. But then he heard a tired sigh.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>You should not have come here. You should not have stayed here. You should not have used the phone. You should not have called me. Now be ready to face the consequences. And the first one on the list will be your wife Saba.&#x201D;</p> <p>Before Ninad could fathom the voice and words, the receiver of the rotary dial telephone burst in flames.</p> <hr /> <blockquote> <p><strong>Wokovu </strong>&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A; <em>Swahili word for salvation</em></p> <p>(noun) deliverance from sin and its consequences</p> </blockquote>

			 <p>Experimentation continues with IndieWeb projects&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;over to Webmentions. It is a really wonderful concept which enables responses to a post to be written on one&#x2019;s own website. As Jeremy Keith <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/6495" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in one of his posts:</p> <blockquote> <p>Basically, it&#x2019;s an equivalent to pingback. Let&#x2019;s say I write something here on adactio.com. Suppose that prompts you to write something in response on your own site. A web mention is a way for you to let me know that your response exists.</p> </blockquote> <p>Even better, and simpler to follow explanation <a href="https://allinthehead.com/retro/378/implementing-webmentions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is put out by</a> Drew Mclellan detailing what&#x2019;s involved in implementing webmentions.</p> <blockquote> <p>The flow goes something like this.</p> <ul> <li>Frankie posts a blog entry.</li> <li>Alex has thoughts in response, so also posts a blog entry linking to</li> <li>Alex&#x2019;s publishing software finds the link and fetches Frankie&#x2019;s post, finding the <span class="small-caps">URL</span> of Frankie&#x2019;s Webmention endpoint in the document.</li> <li>Alex&#x2019;s software sends a notification to the endpoint.</li> <li>Frankie&#x2019;s software then fetches Alex&#x2019;s post to verify that it really does link back, and then chooses how to display the reaction alongside Frankie&#x2019;s post.</li> </ul> <p>The end result is that by being notified of the external reaction, the publisher is able to aggregate those reactions and collect them together with the original content.</p> </blockquote> <p>I have got the webmentions (and pingbacks) enabled here&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;over to testing now. So there you have it. This post is also an attempt at sending a webmention.</p>

			 <p>A mystery thriller &#x2014; what do I expect from a book that categorises itself as that? A deep, dark mystery to start with. Woven into a tight, intriguing plot. A protagonist as bemused as the reader about the main plot, but a lot smarter to overcome the clues and riddles en route. If it&#x2019;s a Robert Langdon mystery, I am trained now to expect a bit less of the later. Of course, with abundance of information on art - the artists, the structures, the paintings - delivered as riddles relevant to the overarching plot.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Origin fails on all counts for me. The mystery it intends to solve is too thin &#x2014; the plot is stretched too long. It isn&#x2019;t even a good Langdon story. All our polymath symbologist is made to do throughout is sit through the tiresome travelogues and some bootless scientific blabber. All in hope of an earth-shattering reveal &#x2014; unfortunately even that fails to be one.</p> <p>Langdon is flown to Bilbao, Spain by his old student Edmond Kirsch to witness his presentation with potentially far-reaching effects on the religions all around the world. And of course, humanity too. He has already unnerved a set of prominent religious figures by a special and exclusive preview of his discovery. <em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Where do we come from? Where are we going?&#x201D;</em> The enigmatic billionaire futurist has the world&#x2019;s eyes with a promise to answer these longstanding questions. But a brain-washed assassin throws the world into disarray by eliminating Kirsch. Only hope rests, then, on Professor Langdon and the bold &amp; gorgeous sidekick, Ambra Vidal, to uncover their friend Edmond&#x2019;s discovery.</p> <p>There are a lot of subplots involving, of course the brainwashing of the assassin and his quest to stop the protagonist duo on run, the family feud in monarchy and the struggle of the <em>Guardia Real</em> on whom and what to trust. And then their is Edmond&#x2019;s most prized invention, his own personal <em>Jarvis</em> - the <span class="small-caps">AI</span> assistant Winston.</p> <p>In short, there is a lot going on here. But it is presented in a bloated form where nothing captures reader&#x2019;s attention or gets his pulse rising. All plot twists are easy to see miles ahead. The chapter-end cliffhangers just tend to delay some trivial or glaring surprises. Same applies to the now-renowned Brown template of holding back from reader a specific information that character owns. I admit it might be a style of keeping readers intrigued. But when the substance is not meaty, one just feels cheated. And finally the ending is anticlimactic &#x2014; feeble, obvious and noncommittal.</p> <p>What about the knowledge sharing sessions of Langdon, you may ask? Yes, there are a lot. And I have been forthcoming in my dislike for the irrelevance of them. This is what I had said in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/644631174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my review</a> of Inferno.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Many a times, the novel reads as Brown&#x2019;s travelogue of places during his research, just there to increase the page count.&#x201D; That hasn&#x2019;t been fixed in here too. Rather it has gone worse. In Inferno, at list the flabby travelogue were towards solving a clue. Here the sessions are just feckless, as Langdon wanders on, contemplating.</p> <p>With Origin, Brown intended to take on a strong idea &#x2014; about creation and destiny. About God&#x2019;s existence. A deft rigidness while editing could well have turned this into terse, riveting story. Alas, it wasn&#x2019;t to be.</p> <p>My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2192770458" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 of 5 stars</a></p>

			 <blockquote> <p>The time in between sparked a brief panic in a state&#xA0;where fears of an attack by North Korea have heightened in recent months. Residents and tourists reported seeking shelter, frantically gathering supplies, and calling and texting loved ones to say their goodbyes.<br /> <br /> The alerts quickly turned a serene Saturday morning into<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>mass hysteria&#x201D; on the roads.<br /> <br /> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>My boyfriend was like,<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&#x2018;</span>Who do we sue for this?&#x2019; We don&#x2019;t just need an apology, we need an explanation. Someone could have had a heart attack,&#x201D; McLaughlin, 29, said.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>It took something that&#x2019;s kind of incomprehensible and very quickly made it very personal. All of a sudden going through your mind is,<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&#x2018;</span>Is this the end of my life?&#x2019; I called my mom, I called my dad, I called my brother and basically said my goodbyes.&#x201D;<br /> <br /> Honolulu resident Noah Tom was picking up breakfast for a meeting when he heard of the alerts. Thinking he might only have 15 to 20 minutes before a missile strike, Tom considered how his family was split up across three locations: He had just dropped off his oldest daughter at the airport, while his two younger children were at home. His wife was already at work.<br /> <br /> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>I literally sent out<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&#x2018;</span>I love you&#x2019; texts to as many family members as I could. It was all kind of surreal at that point,&#x201D; Tom, 48, told The Washington Post. He made the difficult decision of turning the car toward home, where his two youngest children were.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>I figured it was the largest grouping of my family.&#x201D;</p> </blockquote> <p>Irrespective of how pathetic and juvenile <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/hawaii-nuclear-missile-alert-false-explanation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the cause</a> for the trigger of this alarm was, it shows what the fallouts of such a tragic event, wish and hope it never really happens, will be. Looking at the positive side, if we can, it also has triggered an opportunity for all, the relevant agencies, those governing and those governed, to gauge how ready we are for such a calamity. And how it deeply can affect us.</p> <p>Appearing strong on Twitter is one thing. But staying strong when faced with an imminent, life altering event is a whole different ball-game.</p> <hr /> <p>Well, the user interface that&#x2019;s one of the causes for this whole mess is even horrible than what I had imagined. It&#x2019;s so amusing to find that the system that is supposed to alarm the population about a calamity is such a horrible hodgepodge of strangles text. This is no better than having nothing, which we in India have.</p> <p></p> <p>I know the having-nothing-like-India argument is bit of a stretch, but man this interface is horrid.</p>

			 <blockquote> <p>Looking at these graphs feels a lot like looking at a graph of dependencies in a codebase. If you add a node for each class, and draw and edge between the classes that communicate, you&#x2019;ll end up with a graph like the ones above. My talk of<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>components&#x201D; and<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>modules&#x201D; was influenced by thinking about these graphs in terms of software. The last example touches on an important point - you can manage a growing codebase without growing in complexity if you manage the way modules connect to each other. A codebase composed of small interconnected modules that communicate with each other in a well-defined way will have a lower complexity than one where the modules communicate with each other haphazardly.<br /> <br /> This is an example of how it&#x2019;s better to manage interaction along a point than along an edge. By that I mean modules that present a single point of interaction will be able to maintain their own internal dynamics without polluting the complexity of the codebase. If programmers don&#x2019;t think about how they connect the modules in their codebase, and they end up connecting modules along multiple points of interaction, the complexity of the codebase will grow.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is such a fascinating read. I have recently come across the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">four color theorem</a> many times in different variants. It is a fascinating mathematical statement on graphs, specifically maps. But I could never imagine how it could also be applied to represent software complexity, or rather how one can build and manage the growing codebase of a software without adding to the complexity.</p> <hr /> <p>Of course, the theorem is concisely explained by <a href="http://jamesgrime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr James Grime</a> at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numberphile</a> channel on YouTube.</p> <div style="width:0;height:0"> </div><div class="videoContainer" style="padding-bottom:56.5%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NgbK43jB4rQ?rel=0&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>May I enter Detective?”, Mr Rao peeks through the open door of the kitchen. <span class="pull-double">“</span>I heard you had something you wanted to talk to me about.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Of course, Mr Rao. Come in. And please call me Naik. <span class="pull-single">‘</span>Detective’ burdens the conversation for no necessary reason. I just want to have some chat. And at the same, if I can get the work I am here for, done quickly, better for all of us. Right?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Sure. By the way, <span class="pull-single">‘</span>Mr’ is no less burdensome,” quips Mr Rao, half-heartedly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>So what do you know about the situation we are in Rao?” Naik’s quick, curt response takes Rao by surprise. He realises that irrespective of the words used, the conversation to follow is going to be somber. His brow is getting damp, and he knows that isn’t a good sign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Nothing much to be frank. I came late from work yesterday, was completely tired you see. So I went straight to my room and went to sleep. I was woken up only in the morning by your friend, asking me to join you here. So in a sense, I know lesser than you do.” Rao blurts out everything he had come prepared with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>That was lickety-split, huh, Rao.” Rao sees Naik lean closer and look deeper at him. He could sense Naik believes he knows more than what he was revealing. <span class="pull-double">“</span>Anything else you want to mention? We can also go through, you know, the regular <em>drill</em>. I can ask some questions to remind you of stuff you may know.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rao sighs. <span class="pull-double">“</span>I gave you what matters Naik. Others’ just stuff. Details.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naik is again quick to respond, <span class="pull-double">“</span>It is the stuff, the details I love Rao. You see otherwise this detective job is boring. What fun is it to listen only to the sad, murky bites from people’s lives?” He pats Rao’s lap a couple of times, then slumps back into the beanbag. <span class="pull-double">“</span>I love this job because I get to know people - their habits, their thoughts, their behaviours. I happen to solve some crazy cases over last few years just through such chats. Nothing much.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rao knows that wasn’t really the case — Naik was in the news a lot recently because he was a sagacious detective. He realises his attempt to skim through yesterday’s happenings was futile. He also knows <em>the regular drill</em> with Naik would be a lot more dreadful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>As you wish Naik. I have been living in this house for last 4 years. You must already know&nbsp;..”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rao sees Naik signalling something to his friend. Realising Rao has stopped, Naik grins and mouths a nimble <span class="pull-single">‘</span>sorry’ and leans back again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rao continues, <span class="pull-double">“</span>You must already know that we are 4 people sharing the house. Actually, 3 now, given, you know..” He peeps at the chalk outline around where Joy’s body lay. <span class="pull-double">”</span>I met Joy just a couple of weeks back when he joined us in this house. Adi and he knew each other from the beginning. I am not sure how though. I haven’t got much chance to talk to them about their acquaintance. Adi and I have known each other for last two years. He is a good guy, so was Joy, I guess. Unfortunate, he had to fall this way.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naik’s scratching his soul patch, deep in some thoughts. <span class="pull-double">“</span>How do you think Joy died?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rao shrugs and then responds, <span class="pull-double">“</span>Well, it was an unfortunate accident, wasn’t it? An electric shock while using that Microwave? And that is why I was stumped in the morning when I heard you are on the case. Why, do you think there is some foul play here?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Sir,” Naik straightens up, <span class="pull-double">“</span>I rarely do think when I am on a case. As I told you earlier, I just come to chatter. I have just happened to have solved few cases over such chats. Anyway, do you know a lot about Microwaves?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rao is taken aback by the direct question. <span class="pull-double">“</span>Why? Me? No.&nbsp;I mean I am not an electrical engineer.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>It’s alright, of course,” Naik grins. <span class="pull-double">“</span>I just felt you looked a lot confident on the reason behind Joy’s death. So I thought you must know something about Microwaves that I don’t. Why do you feel that that harmless device is the reason we are sitting here Rao?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rao continues to stare at Naik, his heart pounding now. <em>I have no idea what’s cooking inside this devil’s mind.</em> The perspiration is now clearly visible on his forehead. <span class="pull-double">“</span>Mr Naik, I have no idea what you are hinting at. On my way here, Adi had mentioned that Joy’s died of electric shock. I see him lying here on the floor, his legs towards the Microwave, with it still displaying the time since it had been on. Other than Joy’s fallen body, nothing else looks out of sort for this room. There are no signs of any combat that might have played out here last night. So I connect the dots and feel his death has to be natural — he got the electric shock while using the Microwave and&nbsp;..”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>.. and he then turned around to fall face first?” Naik isn’t looking at Rao anymore — he is busy noting down something in his diary. After a momentary pause, he apologises, <span class="pull-double">“</span>Oh, sorry. I didn’t mean to break your train of thoughts. But you were doing my job so well, that I felt I should help you too.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tone of snark in Naik’s voice isn’t lost on Rao and he is done fooling around though. <span class="pull-double">“</span>See. I have no clue what’s going on here. I have no idea why you are even here. I came home late yesterday, slept right away. I haven’t been to the kitchen since then — came here only in the morning today when you called me. I do not know Joy well, neither did I have an issue with him. He appeared to be a calm sedate guy, it’s unfortunate that he passed away. Even more unfortunate is the fact that now that you are on the case, we all would be held up in this house till you are done and I have <em>to chat</em> with you.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Aha, that’s how you summarise,” Naik is already jotting something in his notebook. <span class="pull-double">“</span>Thank you so much, Rao. You can leave now.” He goes through the content of page titled<span class="push-double"> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Mr Roy (x)”.</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Does not know Joy. Adi knows Joy well. Rao knows Adi well.</p><p>Easily swayed by bites of information and runs with it.</p><p>Lies about not being to the kitchen yesterday after office — has his tiffin at the wash basin.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As Rao is about to leave the kitchen, Naik stops him. <span class="pull-double">“</span>Just a food for thought Rao. Why do you think Joy died <em>while</em> using the Microwave and not, say, <em>after</em> using it?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rao, wiping his brow, shrugs, <span class="pull-double">“</span>I don’t know. Maybe because people do not instantly die after using a microwave. They usually eat?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naik slumps back, satisfied, in his beanbag, <span class="pull-double">“</span>There you go. Thank you, Mr Rao. You can go back to the living room.” He makes another note.</p>

			 <p>Rick was following this foreign body across his own home for quite some time now. He did not like new people entering his den, rather he scorned all who did. The loneliness that the fate had stewed into his existence had made him finicky. For him, the life was far better when he was left alone.</p> <p>And Rick was always alone. He was alone when he first opened his eyes in an orphanage. He was alone when he first learned to walk, when he uttered his first word. He was alone with his foster parents &#x2014; people who used him as nothing more than a childminder to their younger son. He loved to walk, he loved to talk. But with no one ever by his side, life turned him into a lonely bloke.</p> <p>So he ran away from the foster home, ran away from the people. He still does not recall how long was he hitchhiking - on the road, on the sea. He just stopped moving a fine day and fell into a surrounding he cared least about. He learnt he needed money to exist, he learnt ways to earn money, he earned money to exist. And he did exist. However, by now, his existence was under the fastidious care of his loneliness.</p> <p>A silent persistent rumble brought Rick back to the reality. His heart sank to see how much mess the repairman was leaving behind in his house.</p> <p>Unable to bear the ruin, Rick shouted,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Do you really have to screw around my whole house, strewing all your mess all across the floor?&#x201D;</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Of course. Your neighbour has paid me to do,&#x201D; teased the repairman. Realising how futile it was to kid around this sobersides, he corrected himself,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span>Your neighbour has complained he hears a lot of noise in this wall, he is afraid there is a rat or some living creature in here.&#x201D;</p> <p><em>How can there be?</em>, wondered Rick within.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span>You have to go, now,&#x201D; snarled Rick.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Why? If there is a rat, it will help you too.&#x201D; The repairman resumed his work &#x2014; Rick perceived it as nothing less than carnage.</p> <p><em>He has to <strong>go</strong>. Now.</em></p>

<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Gotya, wake up, you bum.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gotya was shaken up from his sleep. He shuddered, then forced his face to point to where the sound was coming from. He let in as much of his father’s looming figure as his hazy vision allowed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gotya’s father was tired of Gotya’s utter lack of competence at any work there possibly was to do. Gotya, on the other hand, was fed up with the extreme truculent manner in which his father constantly chided him. Neither of them attempted to right anything. Gotya continued to laze away the days and the nights. His father continued to bark at him for doing so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>What are you going to do now?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Just what you told me <em>Baba</em>,” was all he managed to mutter. He was still livid with his father for waking him up early. Just as he was every day. He was still spread across his <em>Charpai</em> — spread even more than the bedsheet beneath him did.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>And what is that?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Not to do anything stupid,” he hissed now — his father just won’t give up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>That is what you <em>are not</em> going to do, Gotya. I asked what <em>are</em> you going to do now?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gotya sighed. <span class="pull-double">“</span>Haven’t we just gone through this?” he pondered. And finally, annoyed, he shot back, <span class="pull-double">“</span>Anyway, what am I going to do?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>We just went through this, you idiot. Stop being stupid.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>See.” It was Gotya who barked now. <span class="pull-double">“</span>That’s why I keep saying you are getting old now. Isn’t that exactly what I said I am going to do - not doing anything stupid?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gotya sat straight now, his father contrarily bent a little. He then stretched somewhat and then bent a lot more, sighing. <em>Herding this fool is no less difficult than the thoughtless goats, goats are easier withal,</em> he mumbled.</p>

			 <p>The Apple Event of September 2017 was in many ways just another iPhone launch day. It was marked by the typical, yearly frenzy in the media and the tech community. But in few other ways, it also lent the day a uniqueness of its own. Of course, it was the first one from the Apple Park at the Steve Jobs Theatre.</p> <p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/fromedome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Frommer</a> from Recode has perfectly captured the launch of this stunning architecture in <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16299086/apple-park-steve-jobs-theater-iphone-event-photos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this great photo essay</a>, also summarizing this well run event. I remember all the pictures that had started pouring into my Twitter timeline were full of <a href="https://twitter.com/JoannaStern/status/907630869346607104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">excitement</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/settern/status/907633507043700737" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amazement</a>. And of course, so was Tim Cook.</p> <p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&apos;s a big day at Apple! We are honored and thrilled to host our first keynote at the Steve Jobs Theater this morning. <a href="https://t.co/gyiqPJB46y">pic.twitter.com/gyiqPJB46y</a></p>&#x2014; Tim Cook (@tim_cook) <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/907622761786253312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 12, 2017</a></blockquote> </p> <p>I, personally, am always excited for every Apple event&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;their story behind and commitment to the design of their products always mesmerises me. They are proud of every product they make and that shows from their excitement while exhibiting each one of them. The unveiling event of any product is never about just showing what the product is or about a spec roundup to opine on how their&#x2019;s is better than the competition. It is, rather, a well-choreographed and well-rehearsed stage show. And for them, it matters that they tell their side of the story&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;be it the detailing that went in while designing it, the breakthrough they achieved in a thing that people might perceive as almost irrelevant or their reasons and justifications behind the known compromises<a href="#footnote-1DFJ" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-1DFJ"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p> <p>So in that sense, this event at the Apple Park was indeed unique. Apple revealed this newest product, one that got unveiled the first - Steve Jobs Theatre, without they arranging any show, narrating any backstory for it. Apple just opened the doors and handed it to the curious media straight for hands-on. Steve was heard saying<a href="#footnote-2DFJ" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-2DFJ"><sup>2</sup></a> at the beginning of the event <em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>One of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there&#x201D;</em>. Apple did just that with the Steve Jobs Theatre.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/_img/steve-jobs-theatre.jpeg" alt="Steve Jobs Theatre"></p> <p>John Gruber, as always, has the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/welcome_to_the_steve_jobs_theater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apt perspective</a> on the significance of this latest <em>product</em> from Apple.</p> <blockquote> <p>Five, ten years from now, the Apple Watch Series 3, the iPhone 8, and even the iPhone X are just going to be old products sitting around in drawers. But the public debut of Apple Park, the grand opening of the Steve Jobs Theater, and the company&#x2019;s first public tribute to its founder &#x2014; that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ll remember most about yesterday</p> </blockquote> <section class="footnotes"> <hr /> <ol> <li id="footnote-1DFJ"><p>Apple gets often dinged for attempting to justify and advocate the compromises they had to introduce in the products. For looking at these compromises as an opportunity to sell other costlier products. Sometimes <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/airpods-a-year-later-not-a-joke-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they succeed</a>, at times <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12838024/apple-iphone-7-plus-headphone-jack-removal-courage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they don&#x2019;t</a>. But at least they try when there is just no need given the sales that they eventually achieve.<a href="#ref-1DFJ" class="footnote-back">&#x21A9;</a></p></li> <li id="footnote-2DFJ"><p>It was overwhelming to hear Steve&#x2019;s voice and his crisp words. I feel no awkwardness in revealing that I had a throat choked with emotion just by the fifth words into his message. Very few people have had that effect on me.<a href="#ref-2DFJ" class="footnote-back">&#x21A9;</a></p></li> </ol> </section>

<p>A sudden and repeated knock on the door reverberated through the room. It shook Rama, bringing her back from a sombre which had her unmoved for quite some time now. Unmoved, since a rock shattered her windows and her spirit. A rock with a paper wrapped around it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She had no clue for how long she had been staring at that piece of paper. The words it read were pretty conspicuous in imparting the intentions of the one who wrote them. And they had had her shaken to her core.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Who knows about Sam? And about Ali? And how?</em> Rama wondered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>No one should know about them. No one knows where they came from. No one will ever know where they went. Isn’t that what you always believed?</em> A voice in Rama’s head chided her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She read the words again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I know about Sam. I know about Ali.<br>I know what you did to them.<br>I know what you intend to do to Rachit.<br>I will not let you. Beware.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>None of the three lines should be written by anyone, but herself. And she was pretty confident she had not written them. Or had she?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another knock pierced the silence of Rama’s lab. Darkness was creeping through the shattered window into the lab now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Who can come to the lab? Who even knows you have a lab?</em> The voice questioned Rama again. <em>And you would not be stumped now had you not let Sam and Ali ever leave the lab. Or had them put away forever.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>They had to if Rachit, the cherished felicity of my existence, was to come to my life. They were not perfect. Rachit is,” shouted Rama.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The knocks grew louder, and faster now — each thump pounding vigorously at her mind. And, just as they began, they ceased suddenly. The lab went silent again. And a lot darker. So did her mind.</p>

			 <p>I like to <strong>write</strong>. Emphasis is important because that is exactly what I like to do. I do not want to make the writing process too complicated. I just want a blank canvas that I can fill up with some thoughts in the form of words. It should not matter then if I open it from a desktop or a laptop, a smartphone or a tablet. A blank canvas, without any bells and whistles.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/_img/clean-writing.JPG" alt="clean writing"></p> <p>But even after 10 years of the whole smartphone revolution with the iPhone launch, it is surprising why the platforms that crown themselves as champions for writers&#x2019; interests still fail at enabling them to write on the go. The interface they provide are either too loaded or are just non-existent. For example, this is where Wordpress wants the writers to write at on mobile devices.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/_img/wordpress-interface.JPG" alt="Wordpress Writing"></p> <p>Can this be made any more clunky? Why does it need so many options? Why can&#x2019;t words be interpreted as they are written<a href="#footnote-1DHU" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-1DHU"><sup>1</sup></a>? Why does the interface still need to ask for all this added metadata - especially on a mobile device where the space is already a limited resource?</p> <p>It&#x2019;s just the same with many of the professional publishing platforms. They just have too clunky an interface. Squarespace, same. Wix, ditto. At least with these, it can be understood that the target user base just may not be the writers and the bloggers sort. A look at the templates that they provide and it is clear that they want to target the designers, the professionals in photography or the small businesses. However, irrespective of what sites their users own, they need to understand that they do write too, at times. And when they present their intention to do so, shouldn&#x2019;t you provide the cleanest experience you possibly can? Why load them with too many choices?</p> <p><a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost</a> comes closest to ticking all of the right boxes. It has a markdown based clean editing interface with a preview option. However, during my extended usage while I was hosting this site with Ghost, I found that the interface was a bit too buggy and a lot heavy. It tries to do a lot many things which it needn&#x2019;t really do. When I write, I just do not need a constant <span class="small-caps">CMS</span> and metadata access for the post neither do I need a live preview of what am writing. Unfortunately, it just cannot sort out the minor niggles<a href="#footnote-2DHU" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-2DHU"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p> <p>And then there is the flag-bearer of writer&#x2019;s messiahs - Medium. This platform impressed me with how clean the writing experience was. That was before I intended to do so on a mobile device.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/_img/medium-on-ipad.JPG" alt="Medium on iPad"></p> <p>Yep. <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/journal/medium-thoughts/">No comments</a>. <em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>You can&#x2019;t be a serious writer if you want to write from a mobile device. Get a typewriter and then we will talk. We are for the serious lot.&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>But there is an app for that,&#x201D; you say. Yes, there is. But first of all, there is nothing the app does that cannot be fit in the web application. Secondly, the app itself is extremely limited. There is no support for series or publications, yet, for example.</p> <p>This just makes no sense to me. I just cannot stress this any stronger - <em>Do not neglect mobile</em>. Today&#x2019;s mobile devices (especially, the iPad) are getting a lot capable. There is nothing they cannot handle. A plain text editor should be a cakewalk. Alas, I still do hit such forced hinderances.</p> <p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Not Yet Mobile Friendly&quot;! Sorry, in today&apos;s age that just makes no business sense. <a href="https://t.co/DQjJArqNWj">pic.twitter.com/DQjJArqNWj</a></p>&#x2014; Amit Gawande (@_am1t) <a href="https://twitter.com/_am1t/status/900021822963425280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2017</a></blockquote> </p> <p>Anyway, as an attempt to mediate, I propose the following guidelines for writing interfaces for all the writing/blogging platforms out there, especially on mobile.</p> <ol type="1"> <li>Interfaces need to be clean. Just let the text be written without any onscreen distractions.</li> <li>No toolbars, no sections, no configurations.</li> <li>If emphasis to the text needs to be added, let the word(s) be highlighted and provide the limited options then.</li> <li>If image is to be added, provide option as a shortcut (for example, <em>long press</em> on new line)</li> <li>Forget 1-4. Explore and enable Markdown with easy (not live, but closer to <span class="small-caps">WYSIWYG</span>) preview mode.</li> <li>Remember, many writers do prefer writing in dark. Preferably provide a dark mode.</li> </ol> <p>Yes, just roll an empty screen with a blinking cursor<a href="#footnote-3DHU" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-3DHU"><sup>3</sup></a>. Nothing more. Let the writers fill it up their imagination.</p> <section class="footnotes"> <hr /> <ol> <li id="footnote-1DHU"><p>I understand it is Wordpress and hence there is a plugin for everything. But the point isn&#x2019;t if a clean writing interface can be plugged into a platform. Point is why should there be a need for one.<a href="#ref-1DHU" class="footnote-back">&#x21A9;</a></p></li> <li id="footnote-2DHU"><p>Ghost is not an easy publishing platform to work with. You either need the technology inclination of a developer to self-host and roll your own instance of Ghost or pay way too much to get access to their managed platform (Pro) service. For comparison, it is cheaper to get a website with Squarespace with E-Commerce setup than to get an online blog with Ghost. That&#x2019;s just not competitive enough.<a href="#ref-2DHU" class="footnote-back">&#x21A9;</a></p></li> <li id="footnote-3DHU"><p><a href="https://svbtle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Svbtle</a> does it well. So does <a href="http://pen.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pen.io</a>. Not sure why these services struggle to exist. They have understood what writers need the best. But they just couldn&#x2019;t convince many to join them. Wish Medium and others learn from these and roll out some more writer friendly interfaces on mobile.<a href="#ref-3DHU" class="footnote-back">&#x21A9;</a></p></li> </ol> </section>

<p>Rains were lashing the village of Tikwadi. No being, living, dead or inanimate, had had any respite from the persistent downfall of loaded raindrops. Pathways full of potholes were transformed into rivulets with uneven bed. Not that there was a dire need for use of any of these pathways.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tikwadi was known for the distinct hebetude amongst the dwellers of this rugged land. There were different kinds of people - of varied nature, varied colour, varied beliefs and varied professions. What connected them all was their utter lack of liveliness in the face of any hardship. A hint of annoyance, and the whole village would go dead-still. Extreme summers made them spread themselves on the bed. Stormy monsoons had them locked in their houses. Chilly winters had them cloaked and hooded in the layers of Shawls. The village, and the villagers, ran when the nature was kind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, the incessant rains of last week had got the village long deserted. There was no seeable movement nor any discernible sound, except that of the pounding rain. A whoosh of wind that shook the whole surrounding was, hence, definitely bizarre for its suddenness. It was as if it had no trigger to originate, nor did it have a gradual route to non-existence; it just disappeared. It did leave behind something though, equally odd and a lot more ghastly.</p>

<p>Raghu and Ganya were huddled together under the porch to keep themselves dry, and warm. They saw a body, befogged by the rain around, walk towards them.</p>

<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Has it stopped raining?” Ganya quipped.</p>

<p>He had reached next to them by now. He spoke something that, to Raghu and Ganya, were just noises. They looked at each other, weighing the option of enquiring further. But their lethargic self won. So they just rolled their eyes, went inside and slammed the door in His face.</p>

			 <p>A good round-up by Quartz on why Microsoft failed with Windows Phone; an attempt is also made to run with an alternate reality where Microsoft has avoided that. Its based on Microsoft declaring<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span><em>Windows Phone is free</em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Compared to Google, Microsoft has much stronger connections to hardware OEMs on the one hand and software developers on the other. Its products are widely used and respected by business and consumer customers alike. By offering the Windows Phone platform for free, the company sacrifices licensing revenue, but this unnatural act is more than compensated for by the expansion of the Windows ecosystem. Windows PCs become more attractive, more compatible with the outpouring of mobile devices and applications created by enthusiastic hardware makers and eager app developers.</p> </blockquote> <p>Biggest problem there? Microsoft just didn&#x2019;t have a competitive solution in 2007-08. They were still rolling out <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_HD2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">devices</a> with <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Mobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Mobile</a> <span class="small-caps">OS</span><a href="#footnote-1EB1" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-1EB1"><sup>1</sup></a> and were struggling to come up with their own alternative which would be distinct from what Apple and Google had on offer. Of course, they <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Kin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attempted</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010/06/30/microsoft-kin-is-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">failed</a>, before they finally launched a good enough solution with Windows Phone. But this was around 2010 - good 3 years after iPhone was launched. It just was too late.</p> <p>So, I really think it would not have mattered if Windows Mobile was free. It just wasn&#x2019;t good enough against iOS and Android. What Microsoft needed was a quick relook at their mobile strategy which their success with Windows just didn&#x2019;t allow. Quartz does a good job to summarise the attempts Microsoft made to turn the tide. But abstracting it to<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span><em>Windows Phone failure was easily preventable</em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span> is simply a stretch.</p> <p>It wasn&#x2019;t the culture.

			 <p>A writer who also is a technology enthusiast is a worst combination. Every now and then there is a constant fight between the writer and the tech guy to divert the limited focus. The writer wants to write. The tech guy wants to evaluate the place, the setting where he is writing from. It is constant struggle. It needs to be well defined when the writer needs to be suppressed and when the other guy.</p> <p>Suppressing writer is easy&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;rather writer does not need suppressing. He rarely shouts or fight backs. He is the simpleton; he gives up easy. The tech guy? Not him. He keeps popping his head every so often, questioning the person on how the writer is spending his time.</p> <blockquote> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Is this really the best platform you would be writing at? Look at that writing interface. It is so clunky. How the hell can you write here. I bet there are a lot of better options out there. Why won&#x2019;t you just fix this? Why write when it is just not right?&#x201D;</p> </blockquote> <p>It is so difficult at times to keep the writer focused, to keep the tech guy far away from pestering. Only way I have found this to work is to give him no distractions. Nothing. <em>Leave him with just a screen, a blinking cursor and a keyboard.</em></p> <p><em>No mobile devices around, with screens constantly lighting up on every notification. No laptop devices with multi-window. No music. No television.</em> Lock the two guys down&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;more often than not, the tech guy gives up and goes into a deep somber out of sheer boredom. <strong>The writer prevails.</strong></p>

			 <blockquote> <p>Forecasting the future of technology has always been an entertaining but fruitless game. Nothing looks more dated than yesterday&#x2019;s edition of Tomorrow&#x2019;s World. But history can teach us something useful: not to fixate on the idea of the next big thing, the isolated technological miracle that utterly transforms some part of economic life with barely a ripple elsewhere. Instead, when we try to imagine the future, the past offers two lessons. First, the most influential new technologies are often humble and cheap. Mere affordability often counts for more than the beguiling complexity of an organic robot such as Rachael. Second, new inventions do not appear in isolation, as Rachael and her fellow androids did. Instead, as we struggle to use them to their best advantage, they profoundly reshape the societies around us.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is such a great article from Tim Harford, a must read to understand how we have been always wrong while foreseeing where the technology is moving. Especially important is the fact that it was never the big-bang technological advances that changed the world.</p> <blockquote> <p>But many world-changing inventions hide in plain sight in much the same way &#x2014; too cheap to remark on, even as they quietly reorder everything.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tim calls it the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span><em>toilet paper principle</em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span>. Again, so apt. He has a detailed run-down of many such important, but often overlooked events that deeply affected the multiple phases of industrial revolutions. Do read this article. It is a nice summary of what we have been getting wrong about the technology over time. Also, it lets us reevaluate our perspective and beliefs on where we see the advances to be coming from.</p>

			 <p>Everyday, I have a lot many thoughts about Medium these days. For some reason, I find it is turning out to be not so good a platform for writers. Unfortunately, even the reading experience is slowly degrading.</p> <p>The posts there are too disparate, with the platform really struggling to present them in an easy-to-comprehend manner. Especially the fiction. A dark emotional rant on life is placed right next to an erotica. Yes, erotica.</p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/statuses/901695978889068544" class="uri" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/statuses/901695978889068544</a></p> <p>For some reason, Medium has no strict and defined policy around how to publish, tag and present these <span class="small-caps">NSFW</span> posts. It just is no reader&#x2019;s paradise if one has to be fully attentive and on look out for these posts and people around you. Sigh! By the way that option you have to<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Show fewer stories like this&#x201D;? Yeah, about that. It does not work. Not sure if Medium team even has any backend logic coded for that. Bruh!</p> <p>And don&#x2019;t even get me started on how horrible Medium is for writing on the go.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/_img/medium-on-ipad.JPG" alt="Medium on iPad"></p> <p>Yes, that is a help document on<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>How to write?&#x201D;. <strong>On an iPad.</strong> Not really sure what all is involved in writing a post on Medium that it can&#x2019;t be done with Safari on iPad.

			 <p>I have <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/things-are-changing/">recently converted</a> my blog to a website and, as I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/page/setup">have already documented</a>, I serve it as a static website. I have preferred this approach over a dynamic one that gets driven by a full-fledged <a href="https://Wordpress.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blogging software</a> or a <a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publishing platform</a>. Of course, these were not the only possible options. As is so <a href="https://www.thesitewizard.com/gettingstarted/difference-cms-site-builder.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">well captured</a> by Christopher Heng at his website<a href="#footnote-18IH" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-18IH"><sup>1</sup></a>, the options are just too many.</p> <p>It wasn&#x2019;t an easy call to select one, it never is. Every option one chooses has its own advantages and disadvantages. And, of course, going with a standalone website builder and serving the content as <em>pure</em> <span class="small-caps">HTML</span> had its own too. For me, though, benefits really outweighed the challenges.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/_img/writing-setup.jpg" alt="writing setup"></p> <h2 id="why-choose-a-static-website-for-blogs">Why choose a static website for blogs?</h2> <p>A static website is nothing but a string of <span class="small-caps">HTML</span> pages served by a hosted web server. Every document, blog post or update is a plain <span class="small-caps">HTML</span> page. Given this simplicity of existence, it has some key benefits that attracted me.</p> <ol type="1"> <li>It&#x2019;s quick and cheap to develop</li> <li>It&#x2019;s easy and cheap to host</li> <li>It&#x2019;s fast to be served</li> </ol> <p>Again, Hugo <a href="https://gohugo.io/about/benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">captures</a> them the best.</p> <blockquote> <p>Improved performance, security and ease of use are just a few of the reasons static site generators are so appealing.<br /> <br /> The most noticeable is performance. <span class="small-caps">HTTP</span> servers are very good at sending files&#x2014;so good, in fact, that you can effectively serve the same number of pages with a fraction of the memory and <span class="small-caps">CPU</span> needed for a dynamic site.</p> </blockquote> <p>I have already seen this benefit realised with the performance of my website too.</p> <p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Static website has really helped the overall performance &#x2014; avg response time has gone down from 1300ms to 300ms. &#x1F44A;&#x1F3FD;&#x1F60A; <a href="https://t.co/pPoQNMXCsM">https://t.co/pPoQNMXCsM</a> <a href="https://t.co/udsTKM0RpO">pic.twitter.com/udsTKM0RpO</a></p>&#x2014; Amit Gawande (@_am1t) <a href="https://twitter.com/_am1t/status/898586698895904768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2017</a></blockquote> </p> <p>These benefits should attract every blogger out there looking for a simple manageable solution for their blogs. <em>Then why aren&#x2019;t all blogs served as static website?</em> The answer is, of course, nothing&#x2019;s perfect and static websites are not for all. They bring with themselves a list of challenges.</p> <p>Creating static pages needs a bit of programming skill, and a lot of interest to slog it out over web design and development. In the longer run, maintaining these pages can become cumbersome if they are to be updated even so slightly, every now and then. Especially, if all you care about is the text you write, what gets placed around it is really not of much an interest to you. All you want to do is write and publish. You don&#x2019;t want to awaken the web dev in you every time you want your footer to be updated or a page to be added.</p> <p>Ironically, a rush to dynamic websites to solve this challenge is totally counter to what you really care about, the text. The text is light, the page carrying them needs to be the same. To have these generated every time someone requests for them<a href="#footnote-28IH" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-28IH"><sup>2</sup></a> is just too costly. And to have them stored as database entries is just too messy. <strong>It is text, it needs to be stored as text.</strong></p> <p>Hugo (and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/static-website-generators-jekyll-middleman-roots-hugo-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the likes</a>) provides a nice middle ground. Smashing Magazine summarizes it well.</p> <blockquote> <p>Each generator takes a repository with plain-text files, runs one or more compilation phases, and spits out a folder with a static website that can be hosted anywhere. No <span class="small-caps">PHP</span> or database needed.<br /> <br /> Hugo takes caching a step further and all <span class="small-caps">HTML</span> files are rendered on your computer. You can review the files locally before copying them to the computer hosting the <span class="small-caps">HTTP</span> server.</p> </blockquote> <p>Isn&#x2019;t it, after all, better to make the whole user-facing part of your website into a cache of servable <span class="small-caps">HTML</span> pages and have it generated and deployed locally&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;without loading the server with a programming runtime or a database? This is exactly what Hugo enables.</p> <p>This helps to design, build, test and maintain the website without much of a hassle. And with Hugo, I have already hit all the benefits of a static website I mentioned above, bypassing the challenges it presents. A one-time effort to design and build the website is handled with little pain; now I can focus on writing.</p> <h2 id="workflow-to-write-especially-on-mobile">Workflow to write, especially on mobile</h2> <p>There is another challenge with such websites that are built locally and served statically - all they contain is the final product, the HTMLs. Any change needs to be followed by a rebuild and redeploy. There is no online <span class="small-caps">CMS</span> to handle your content from a browser, especially no <span class="small-caps">WYSIWYG</span><a href="#footnote-38IH" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-38IH"><sup>3</sup></a> web editor to create or modify your posts. Of course, one way to handle this is to deploy a <a href="https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/1325/allowing-customers-to-edit-static-website-via-wysiwyg#1438" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">separate light-weight <span class="small-caps">CMS</span></a>.</p> <p>But for blogging, there is a simple way. All you need is a continuous deployment setup and a couple of applications to handle writing and publishing your posts. I have <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/page/setup/#deploying-with-netlify">already explained</a> how Netlify has helped me achieve the first part. Below is how I circumvent the second challenge<a href="#footnote-48IH" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-48IH"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p> <ol type="1"> <li><p><strong>Write</strong>: It is important you can write from multiple places, especially your mobile devices. Web editors of the blogging platforms allow you just that, keeping your drafts ready for you to pick up from where you left earlier. A static website lacks this and so calls for some other alternatives.</p> <p>I use <a href="https://ia.net/writer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iA Writer</a> to write all my posts. It has apps for all the platforms I own, iOS and macOS. It allows me to focus mainly on writing, automatically saving all the words as I write them. It also keeps all the posts synced up across all the devices, granting me the convenience of cross-device writing that web editors enable. I find it goes even a step further as it provides me a consistent experience across all the platforms, as compared to the messy state of online writing&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;more on this later.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Deploy</strong>: Doing this from desktop was always trivial; handling this from mobile was what puzzled me. However I managed to get a workable solution. Once I have the post ready, I use <a href="https://git2go.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git2Go</a> to push the final Markdown (.md) files to my Git repository. Net
lify does the rest, making the post available at the website. Any minor modifications, it is just an update with iA Writer to these&#xA0;.md files and a push via Git2Go.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Workflow</strong>: Though it is easy to say just write at one place and push to repository, it would be a significant effort to get a file, as per Hugo-defined format, ready for writing. Any generator needs some added metadata, <em>front matter</em> in Hugo land, embedded along with the content to create a serve-ready <span class="small-caps">HTML</span>. Adding this to every post I write would have been a downer; especially with my intention of writing different types of posts - fiction, non-fiction and links.</p> <p>It needed <a href="https://www.workflow.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workflow</a>, I mean literally. The Workflow app is a boon for anyone who wants to automate common tasks on iOS. It is a powerful tool with hundreds of actions that can be easily stitched together to create a workflow&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;one that can handle complex tasks with a single click. For example, here&#x2019;s my workflow to get a link post ready.</p></li> </ol> <ul> <li>Once I find a link I want to share and add some comment on, I open it in Safari and just copy the content I want to comment on</li> <li>I trigger the relevant workflow from the share sheet</li> <li>Workflow then <ul> <li>fetches the template for the link post</li> <li>adds the link to the metadata as the source <span class="small-caps">URL</span></li> <li>adds the current date and time as the post date</li> <li>adds the title I provide (or the title of original post if none provided)</li> <li>takes the content from clipboard, adds to the content body</li> <li>saves the file and opens it in iA Writer to be edited further</li> </ul></li> <li>Once the post is ready to be published, I just export the post as Markdown from iA Writer and import it to Git2Go in the content section.</li> <li>Commit &amp; Push, and the link post is ready on the website.</li> </ul> <p>This is just one such workflow. I have managed to create one each for every type of posts I write. Workflow does the routine heavy lifting for me, allowing me to focus on writing.</p> <p class="sec-break" style="margin-bottom:20px"> </p><p>I know just this effort might be overwhelming for many. The act of building, managing and updating the static websites is not everybody&#x2019;s cup of tea. However, for me, I have found that this triplet of enablers - iA Writer, Git2Go and Workflow - serves me well. I have never been so satisfied with either the website or the process involved in publishing to it. I am pretty confident this setup, with minor modifications, will last long.</p> <section class="footnotes"> <hr /> <ol> <li id="footnote-18IH"><p>Heng&#x2019;s website<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span><a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/05/02/top-ten-static-website-generators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">theSiteWizard</a><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span> is really a great resource for anyone interested in building or maintaining their own websites.

<p>Sana hated Joel. It was not because he was a terrible person. It was, rather, for exactly the opposite reason. He was a gem of a person.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He always adorned his face with a wide, charming smile. A smile that captivated everyone, but was neither an attempt at hiding some innate stupidness nor a craving for being characterised as<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span><em>the cheery guy</em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">”</span>. It was all authentic. At work, he was best at what he did - extremely smart and diligent. He mesmerised everyone in the team, inside or the outside, with his knowledge and his stories. Sana had not yet come across a single topic which had him stumped.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sana, on the other hand, was miserably inadequate at work. She rarely completed stuff assigned to her on her own, helping others was unthinkable. She wasn’t too keen either, as it involved interacting with them. As part of a group, she was perceived to be the pensive dumbo. She rarely added anything to a conversation, but got always swayed by everyone’s perspective. More often than not, she left a conversation being bitter for her inability to contribute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not Joel. He was never seen fussed. Outside of work, he dialled his impressiveness up a notch. He was a terrific singer — Sana believed he was good enough to be a lead singer of any band. Every party had a performance from the cheery guy. Him, strumming guitar, and his soulful crooning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sana had no interests, no passions. She was into her late twenties, and she had no profile to boast of. Every attempt of hers to break free was shot down mercilessly by her fate. Some by the fateful accident that took her family away. Some by the untimely fire that took her friends away. Fate never allowed Sana to be the unfettered child, burdening her always with the needs of ever debasing circumstances.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Sana?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sana was woken up by a collective shrill around her. Everyone was looking at her. And she, through her teary eyes, had been looking at Joel, a usual guitar in his hand. She, then, heard Joel speak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Yes, her. She is a great singer. I have heard her croon many times.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fate, over her life, had nurtured Sana to be a grouchy wench. Sana hated Joel for dissuading her from being herself.</p>

			 <blockquote> <p>In the bitcoin economy, time really is money. Every 10 minutes or so, mining machines compete with each other to solve a math problem to win 12.5 bitcoins, a reward set by the bitcoin software. The work is akin to trying out billions of combinations of numbers on a safe. The miner who gets the right combination the fastest unlocks the safe. The more machines you have, the greater your chances of earning coins.</p> </blockquote> <p>The whole economy around bitcoins (&#x201C;<em>the stateless digital currency whose total market value has more than quadrupled this year to $70 billion</em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span>) mesmerises me.

It stumps me though to think that whoever is capable of owning huge wearhouses, being called mines now, that host nearly unlimited processing power will soon govern this universe. And the most prestigious job available would be to tend to the machines generating this power.</p> <blockquote> <p>Machines at the mine break all the time, given there are 25,000 devices.

This parallel universe will not be run as it is today. Disruption is waiting to happen when everything of a world goes digital.</p>

<p>Oas looked at the grumpy old sod again lying down in front of Sara’s picture. Well, at least that is what he thought Mr Marvel was. Somewhere deep down he knew he too was exactly the same — an old grumpy looking sod. And Marvel had made sure Oas is never allowed to forget that. He saw a human reflection in the feline every time he looked at him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But as Sara had wished, Oas had made him his buddy, his partner for years now. They were inseparable — waking up and cleaning together; cooking and eating together; reading and sleeping together. Marvel made sure he spent, with Oas, every single minute of the day, spreading happiness and contentment. And Oas always believed things would stay the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alas, the time has a way of unearthing one’ fallacies — putting one face-to-face with history. Didn’t Oas hold similar beliefs about his happy times with Sara? How can he have forgotten so quickly that they didn’t last him for the lifetime either? And today he woke up from the self-induced dreamy slumber again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not by Marvel, but by the absence of him on his side. Oas trotted down the stairs to find him motionless in front of Sara. He knew the grumpy sod was done being grumpy. Sara would’ve been ululating next to Marvel’s body — that was if she had been alive. Now, she must be dancing with joy, with Marvel to her side, at whichever the place it is where people go to stop being the sad mortals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The thought cheered Oas up. He too was close to done being the grumpy old sod.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>This is the conclusion of the story I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/marvelling-at-life/">had published</a> on how Sara brought these two grumpy old souls together.</p>

<p>This is my personal place, a destination where one can find every thought I ever post on the web, anywhere. At times it originates, and so just exists, here. There are also times when it’s <a href="https://medium.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published</a> at <a href="https://theweeklyknob.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some</a> <a href="https://medium.com/misplaced-identities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other</a> <a href="https://crossingenres.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">places</a> first, but is also made available here. It has been in existence since 2008 and just like every year, this time too I wanted another fresh start for this place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have already documented all the <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/things-are-changing/#simplicity-vs-customisation">history behind</a> and the <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/things-are-changing/#enter-hugo">context for</a> the existence of this site and this page. Here, I intend to document all there’s to know about this site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before I get to the details, this is what I set to achieve when I began.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"type":"1"} -->
<ol type="1"><li>A website designed, in and out, to my liking, with every knob controlled by me.</li><li>A landing page with a brief about me and the site. One that clearly links to the key content.</li><li>Clean and simple experience, while reading a post or navigating the site.</li><li>Consistent writing experience, preferably offline, across mobile and desktop.</li><li>Source control for the whole place. No fallouts from brain freezes.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I do not believe what I sought out was that complex. So I was confident I could get this working.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"post-note"} -->
<p class="post-note"><strong>Here’s the <code>TL;DR</code> version of what I have achieved.</strong> <br><strong>1.</strong> <del>This</del> My old site was built with Hugo — it is extremely simple, highly customisable, well documented and has an active community. It’s difficult to beat all of that. <a href="#core-engine-hugo">∞</a> <br><strong>2.</strong> The look and layout of this site is themed by an extremely personalised port of the original <span class="pull-single">‘</span>ghostwriter’ theme. I intend to open-source the same soon. <a href="#personalising-the-look-layout">∞</a> <br><strong>3.</strong> The source for the complete website along with all the posts, as markdown files, resides in GitHub. Every change to this setup is driven as it would be in a standard git project. <a href="#cushioning-against-brain-freeze">∞</a> <br><strong>4.</strong> Contents from Squarespace were exported into a Wordpress package first. They were converted into markdown files using ExitWP. Followed by cleanup. And deploy. <a href="#migrating-the-content">∞</a> <br><strong>5.</strong> This site is deployed by Netlify. With continuous deployment and one-click <span class="small-caps">SSL</span> for custom domains possible with minimum configuration, the choice was pretty simple. <a href="#deploying-with-netlify">∞</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="core-engine---hugo">Core Engine - Hugo</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had always wanted to attempt a site creation from scratch, but I failed miserably every single time. Given I had ample time before my Squarespace subscription expired, I attempted it again this time. I believe I did not fail. This is a static site, built with <a href="http://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugo</a>. It was the ease with which I could get a site running on my dev environment via Hugo that convinced me about the viability of this whole project. If you do not believe, just head over to the Hugo docs for a <em><a href="http://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quick start</a></em> and begin. You will have a site running by step two. It is that easy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You would have also realised how well document the whole framework is from your visit to the quick start guide. There is nothing that you want to achieve that isn’t documented. In addition, given that Hugo is written in <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoLang</a>, it gave me an opportunity to learn a new language. Post that, every need of mine to get the things just right was just a code snippet away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, find below a snippet for fetching a list of random five articles. Yes, it is easy. And a lot powerful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&#123;&#123; $pag := where .Data.Pages "type" "post" } } &#123;&#123; range (shuffle $pag | first 5) } } &#123;&#123; ....custom.... } } &#123;&#123; end } }</pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if it does turn out that there is some tricky edge case that you just can’t get your head around (or you are being plain, simple lazy), there is a <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thriving community</a> of fellow users which is extremely active and a lot helpful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"post-note"} -->
<p class="post-note"><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Hugo is simple, highly customisable, well documented and has an active community. It’s difficult to beat that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="personalising-the-look-layout">Personalising the look & layout</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once I had the core finalised, I shifted my attention to personalising the site. And again Hugo comes with a lot of good looking <a href="http://themes.gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">themes</a> — extremely minimalistic to fully loaded. You will always find the one for your liking there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you, like me, do not find one that ticks all the boxes for you, you can select any that is closest and get to personalising. All the themes come with the source code. So if it suits you, let the developer in you go wild.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I began with a theme <span class="pull-double">“</span><a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/ghostwriter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghostwriter</a><span class="pull-double">”</span>. It was simple and I could see how it can be extended to enable every aspect that I wanted to achieve. So I began working. After a week of customisation, I could finally see the site shaping up just the way I imagined.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><del>I intend to soon open source the changes I have made to the original theme. I am working on cleaning up the source and committing.</del> All the enhancements and personalisations added to the theme are available at Github. If you like the theme that you see and if you are using Hugo for building your Static website, you can download and use the theme from <a href="https://github.com/am1t/ghostwriter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"post-note"} -->
<p class="post-note"><strong>TL;DR</strong>: The look and layout of this site is themed with an extremely <a href="https://github.com/am1t/ghostwriter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">personalised and open-sourced port</a> of the original <span class="pull-single">‘</span>ghostwriter’ theme. <del>I intend to open-source the same soon.</del></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="cushioning-against-brain-freeze">Cushioning against brain freeze</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes. Commits and port. I am not letting another of my brain freeze moments to spoil all the efforts the put in over the years. Refer the history section I mentioned in my introduction above.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So whole website is a git project. It is currently maintained as a private repository at <a href="https://github.com/am1t/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>. Every change, major or minor is committed. Every milestone is tagged as release. And every major enhancement is pull request. No, I am not taking any risk with myself this time. Here is a snapshot for the effort that has gone in to bring the v1 of this site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do I intend to make the source of this website public? Well, initially I wanted to do just that. However, I do want to keep my messy drafts, be it to the posts or the website, just to myself. I could not find a public way to achieve that. So as of now, the source stays private.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"post-note"} -->
<p class="post-note"><strong>TL;DR</strong>: The source for the complete website along with all the posts, as markdown files, <a href="https://github.com/am1t/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resides in GitHub</a>. Every change to this setup is driven as it would be in a standard git project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="migrating-the-content">Migrating the content</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Talking about the posts, I had to bring the old entries along from Squarespace. After all, this is also a place for my writings. I would not want to loose any of my old ones<a id="ref-1DXK" class="footnote-ref" href="#footnote-1DXK"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time, though, I did not have the luxury of the out-of-box imports. I had to do it on my own. Well, I did have a couple of points playing on my side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>I have been writing all my posts in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">markdown</a> format and exporting them as required.</li><li>Current setup with Hugo is all markdown driven, where every content exists as a <code>.md</code> file.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, all I had to do was find a way to export the content from Squarespace as markdown files. I wish it was that simple; it wasn’t. The only option that Squarespace supports for export is as a Wordpress package. However, anyone who has been blogging for even a slightest of time would know Wordpress package should be fine. Because there is nothing to be done with a Wordpress package that no one else has already tried. Just getting markdown files out of that must be a cakewalk. Markdown, after all, is a geek’s solution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as I thought, it already is handled. <a href="https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ExitWP</a> is a great tool to migrate a Wordpress blog to a static site. It is introduced as a tool to convert to <span class="pull-double">“</span><em>the <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jekyll</a> blog engine</em><span class="pull-double">”</span>. But that should be fine. Both Jekyll and Hugo use markdown files as content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After going through the steps as documented at the git repo for ExitWP, I had all the content available as markdown files<a id="ref-2DXK" class="footnote-ref" href="#footnote-2DXK"><sup>2</sup></a>. It did need the below minor cleanup.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Images had to be handled separately. All references were to the Squarespace domain. Thankfully, I maintain a credit link with every image to the original one. So I just had to re-download, compress and deploy them.</li><li>Front matter needed porting to the Hugo standard. I did weigh in the option to write a script to do that. But then ended up siding on doing it manually.</li><li>Post content did need some minor fixing. ExitWP has some issue handling and regenerating the emphasis, especially around symbols (for example, quotation marks, dashes etc).</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Deploy the post, test each one from the post link on dev and I had all my content back. Thanks to this effort, I believe I never have to worry about porting out my content ever. Every published copy of a post stays as a raw file with me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"post-note"} -->
<p class="post-note"><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Export contents from Squarespace to Wordpress package. Use ExitWP to convert it into markdown files. Cleanup. Deploy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="deploying-with-netlify">Deploying with Netlify</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once I had a site running on dev and tested multiple times to bring it to my liking, I had to start thinking on a place to deploy it. And of course, Hugo has all the possible options <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">well documented</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As my code was in GitHub, the first option I tried was to <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deploy it</a> on GitHub Pages. I configured Hugo to generate the static pages in a defined directory (configured as submodule for the GitHub pages repository). I built my site, pushed the changes and deployed, and it all looked fine. However, there was just one problem — the deployment workflow was a bit messy. In addition there were few more niggles<a id="ref-3DXK" class="footnote-ref" href="#footnote-3DXK"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>There is no provision for <span class="small-caps">SSL</span> with custom domains. So they cannot yet be delivered over secure <code>http</code>.</li><li>Auto-triggering for build and deploy had to be configured as web hooks.</li><li>Given the deployment workflow, publishing from mobile was just out of question.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On reading some more, I found a far simpler option in <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netlify</a>. Again I will let the official document explain itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Netlify builds, deploys and hosts your front end. It provides continuous deployment services, global <span class="small-caps">CDN</span>, ultra-fast <span class="small-caps">DNS</span>, atomic deploys, instant cache invalidation, one-click <span class="small-caps">SSL</span>, a browser-based interface, a <span class="small-caps">CLI</span>, and many other features for managing your Hugo website.</p></blockquote>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One might say jargon, but there are key needs I had which GitHub pages just didn’t handle — a couple being continuous deployment and one-click <span class="small-caps">SSL</span>. So I did <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another deployment</a> with Netlify and again fell for the simplicity of the things involved. No configuration head-ache. No custom workflow to handle the built site separately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Write Frontend Code. Push it. We handle the rest.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes it, indeed, is that easy. It doesn’t matter then where you push to the repository from, mobile or desktop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is one issue with the Hugo documentation though. One does not need to trigger a build command with Hugo version number appended in it. Just configure a parameter in the build for the version of your Hugo environment.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the Netlify account was created and the continuous deployment for the site setup, I just followed the documentation for using custom domain and setting up <span class="small-caps">SSL</span>. The site was live.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"post-note"} -->
<p class="post-note"><strong>TL;DR</strong>: The deployment of this site is handled by Netlify. With continuous deployment and one-click <span class="small-caps">SSL</span> for custom domains possible with minimum configuration, the choice was pretty simple.</p>

<p>So to summarise, I have first releasable version of this website ready. Built with Hugo. Themed with Ghostwriter. Run with Netlify. And of course, it is just v1.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Musings Et Al. v1:</strong> First version of the website with all the clogs designed and working as planned. It hosts below custom features.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Support for write-up section on homepage driven by config.toml</li><li>Support for headshot on the homepage</li><li>Support for displaying the latest featured post on homepage</li><li>Support for link posts (via refs param in front matter)</li><li>Support for related post along below the content of a post</li><li>Link to the image credit (via imgsrc param in front matter)</li></ul>

<p>It is August. I like to think I am a writer. Somewhere deep down, I also know, though, that I am first a developer. So every August, I happen to relook at the current setup for my presence on the web, go back to the drawing board and change things.</p>

<h2 id="simplicity-vs-customisation">Simplicity vs Customisation</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This domain has had its fair share of hops across multiple CMSes and hosting networks. It began its journey on wordpress.org as a self-hosted blog, then moved to wordpress.com for simplicity. Next year, I yearned for customisation again. I hated that I could control so little of my website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s when <a href="http://ghost.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost</a> attracted me and it kept me happy for a long time. It wasn’t then surprising that I had to move on not willingly, but forcedly. I never documented this next hop, one where I moved out of Ghost. It was a panicky time and hope the reader will empathise with me by the time she is done with the next paragraph.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the experience was good, Ghost had a big upgrade problem. Upgrading the platform wasn’t easy. I managed to do it once, I had to do it again. I soon started getting itchy as I kept procrastinating and the things stayed stagnant. So I gave in and went through the standard procedure. I attempted the upgrade on dev, with success. I tested it and then tested it some more — I made all the notes, noting down the steps to perform the upgrade on production.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Things were on track. And then a crazy bout of standard dev brain-freeze fired an <code>'rm -rf *'</code> on the prod environment. I was left with no website. I had a backup, but only of the content (thanks, fortunately, to the dev/test phase). All the minor styling and customizations were gone though. Reinstating the whole site would have been messy. I was done being a developer. I wanted the simplicity again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And so I signed up for a trial version with <a href="http://squarespace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Squarespace</a> (anyone who listens to a lot of podcasts will realise that the podcast advertisements do work). It was simple. All I had to do was load the content again. Given my simple requirement of a place just for words and occasional pictures, my choice of themes was limited. So the decision was quicker. Some minor customizations with the assistance of extremely helpful customer care later, I had a site again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was relieved. But I wasn’t satisfied.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the effect played out over the year. I felt the overall experience was too loaded for my liking. So, I did not write much here — most of the posts were rewrites from <a href="http://medium.com/@_am1t" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a>. I felt chained by the simplicity. And I was yearning for customisation again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So if you are still with me, you can see this is the <em>tick</em> phase of my <em>tick-tock</em> platform cycle. So it’s going to be something totally custom, something I control throughout. Simplicity is out, customisation is in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I want to control how the website looks and how it is sectioned. I want an easier and uniform way to write offline - at my desk or while mobile - and publish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="enter-hugo">Enter Hugo</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had already hit the ground running and was exploring multiple options. After a bit of reading, I realised a static website could take me closest to what I want. It started with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jekyll</a> first, followed by some more (<a href="http://cryogenweb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cryogen</a>, <a href="https://hexo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hexo</a>, <a href="http://github.com/cliss/camel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Camel</a>). But something was always amiss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s when Hugo caught my eye. A bit of playing around and the ease with which I could get a site running made me decide that Hugo worked best for my needs. I can never explain what Hugo is better than how the official docs do. So here it is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Hugo is a general-purpose website framework. Technically speaking, Hugo is a static site generator. Unlike systems that dynamically build a page with each visitor request, Hugo builds pages when you create or update your content. Since websites are viewed far more often than they are edited, Hugo is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience for your website’s end users and an ideal writing experience for website authors.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And here’s the doc again, explaining for whom Hugo is for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Hugo is for people that prefer writing in a text editor over a browser.</p><p>Hugo is for people who want to hand code their own website without worrying about setting up complicated runtimes, dependencies and databases.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yep. That’s all me. So here’s to another beginning. A completely personalised presence of myself on the web.</p>

			 <blockquote> <p>I don&#x2019;t know what the argument is against showing favicons in Safari&#x2019;s tabs, but I can only presume that it&#x2019;s because some contingent within Apple thinks it would spoil the monochromatic aesthetic of Safari&#x2019;s toolbar area. I really can&#x2019;t imagine what else it could be. I&#x2019;m personally sympathetic to placing a high value on aesthetics even when it might come at a small cost to usability. But in this case, I think Safari&#x2019;s tab design &#x2014; even if you do think it&#x2019;s aesthetically more appealing &#x2014; comes at a large cost in usability and clarity. The balance between what looks best and what works best is way out of whack with Safari&#x2019;s tabs.</p> </blockquote> <p>If that is the reason why there are no favicons in Safari tabs, I believe Apple is taking there quest for design too far. Apple gets blamed for always leaning towards form-over-function. I could see every time why some groups might support the said decision. But this time, I just cannot fathom how someone can find this to be a releasable solution. This is senseless.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sara is getting restless in the queue. There are still a couple of people standing ahead of her; they both look defeated. She wonders if she, too, is donning the same look. <em>I am a Roy,</em> she reminds herself, <em>Roys may lose, but are never defeated</em>. She plasters a smile on her face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She has been standing in the queue for quite some time now. And that makes beaming further more difficult. Especially so, given she has no clue what the queue is for. She peers around; a vast, white, closed hall surrounds her. But all it holds is a queue spiralling outwards, inching slowly towards the centre. Towards a lady, running an apparatus. And a grater — not much different from a normal cheese grater, just unnaturally large.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was in no way the entrance to the afterlife that Sara had always imagined. Not that of the heaven, for sure. Sara feels suffocated. She isn’t prepared to embrace the death yet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The person in front of Sara moves ahead and hands the memory stick to the craggy looking lady. Sara tilts her head with a childish curiosity, and observes the lady and her apparatus. There is a charcoal like block right at the centre of the hall. The lady inserts the memory stick in the only slot the block displays. The block makes some abrasive, unpleasant noises and pops out muskmelon-sized orbs of a person’s memories — some vibrant, some pale. She expressionlessly picks up every orb, the vibrant ones and the pale ones, and grates it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sara watches as the shreds of memories drop straight down the drain below.She tightens her fist around the memory stick she holds. She won’t let her priceless memories die such a dreadful death; it doesn’t matter that’s just how her’s had been.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Next,” Sara hears the lady call out. The voice lacks any emotion, but that makes it sound further weighty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sara greets the lady, just the way she is taught Roys do, with a smile. The lady though — without lifting her chin even slightly — stretches her hand out further.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>I can’t recall how this ended up with me, but here,” Sara hands her the memory stick. She continues in an attempt to sound confident and cheerful, <span class="pull-double">“</span>That’s the memories spanning 20 years of my colourful life.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sara looks on as the block starts spitting the orbs. From the queue, this process felt a lot faster. She could, however, now see the memory that every orb represented.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She looks on as the lady picks up <em>Sara’s first vision of her mum</em> and grates it. She then picks up <em>Sara’s first word</em> and drains the shreds of the faint <em>mma</em>. <em>Her first step</em> meets the same end. The lady continues as she pounces on every dear memory of Sara’s and scrubs it on the grater.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drops of sadness, helplessness flood Sara’s eyes. She has to do something; she couldn’t let this massacre continue unquestioned. <span class="pull-double">“</span>Do you have to grate all my memories?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lady looks up momentarily and then lets out a dull sigh. <span class="pull-double">“</span>Of course, not. It’s not about what do I <em>have</em> to do. It’s about what do <em>you</em> want me to do.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Well, that’s unexpected.</em> Sara ponders, <span class="pull-double">“</span>But why did no one else get that option?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Did you see anyone else question?” The lady had her brows raised, holding Sara’s first day to school. <span class="pull-double">“</span>Some, like you, do. And they get the option. But once they realise what it means, most do not hold on to any of their memories.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sara sees the lady grate her cheery self, hopping to the school. <span class="pull-double">“</span>And what does it mean not grating some memories?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>It means next time you are born, it’s not with a clean canvas.” Sara sees her first crush get shredded down the drain. <span class="pull-double">“</span>You begin your life with some memories; memories without context, without backstories. The questions such memories can raise in one’s mind could potentially draw her crazy.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sara wasn’t convinced. <span class="pull-double">“</span>Can the answers to these question be quested for in one’s lifetime?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Of course, they can be. The vital question is do you want to be born with the baggage?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lady expected an answer, or more questions, from the feisty girl. Failing to get either, she looks up and catches a gleam of excitement sparkle in Sara’s eyes — an excitement she has not seen for a long, long time. She heedlessly looks at the vibrant orb of a cosy pinkish hue that she holds. She sees a dreamy Sara, with the same sparkle in her eyes, looking at a guy walk into her class.</p>

Villagers idled around just the way they always did. Men meandered, dilly-dallying with some unknown angst. Women hustled helter-skelter, pretending to be busy with some unknown chore. And kids spurted kooky from all directions, engulfed with some unknown euphoria. But for a resident of Tikwadi, every day dawned with a new crazy chapter.</p> <p>Even today, a group of men squat around a smallish bonfire. They had Neem stems sticking out of their mouths; and hands, searching for heat, sticking out of their bodies. The chilly month of December always made them do such concoctions &#x2014; they were never sure which body part they wanted to heat by the bonfire and which one to keep warm in the cloak. Raghu and Ganya were doing nothing different.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>I heard Paka saw a ghost yesterday?&#x201D; queried Raghu.</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Where?&#x201D;</em> Ganya raised his brows.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>In his farm, it seems. He was returning from his evening choir. Got late. Heard he saw lights dancing in front of him.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>That idiot must have just seen some fireflies. Anyway, who did you hear it from?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Him.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Him Who?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Paka.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Who else did you hear it from?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>No one else. Why the fuck does that matter?&#x201D; Raghu bit on his Neem a bit too hard.</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Why would you say<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>you heard&#x201D; if the only person you heard it from was the one whom it happened to?&#x201D;</em></p> <p>Raghu spat a chunk of chewed Neem extracts &#x2014; the stem wasn&#x2019;t the only thing that was leaving a bitter taste in his mouth.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Fuck, is that Lala?&#x201D; he howled.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Why the hell is he out of his den?&#x201D;</p> <hr /> <p>Lala was horror personified. A moneylender by profession, and unlike the tradition of Tikwadi, he did not suck at lending money. After all, there are only so many ways someone can lend money. He did not lend money, he sentenced people to lending money from him. He would devise a ploy so intriguing that people just took money from him irrespective of their needs.</p> <p>Paka, <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/blog/the-lone-conductor">the lone conductor of Tikwadi</a>, had fallen for a similar ploy. He once sat at the window of his bus with Lala next to him. He knew he should just keep his mouth shut and eyes focused on anything but the evil. There was a word around the town that Lala can taint one&#x2019;s brain with any opening he finds on your body. Paka did not want his brain to get spoilt; he pulled his beanie tighter over his ears.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>So where&#x2019;s the bus going?&#x201D; Lala began his session.</p> <p><em>Why the fuck does that matter? Where are you going, you devil?</em> Paka cursed in his mind. But he stayed inert, as if lifeless.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>You people controlling this bus are genius; it looks so old. It must be holding a world record for being the oldest bus plying on the road. Why do you still work, as in do a job?&#x201D; Paka looked at Lala with quizzing eyes. Strike one.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Why are you looking at me like that? For this alone, The Guinness Book of Records must have paid you a fortune, no?&#x201D; Paka, still mostly unmoved, had few frowning lines on his forehead. Strike two.</p> <p>Lala continued,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Now don&#x2019;t tell me you did not even apply for the Guinness records?&#x201D; Paka heard him. Strike three. Game over.</p> <hr /> <p>Of course, Lala did not suck at taking the money back from people. He was a ruthless maniac at that. So much so that there was a belief around the town that he had hollowed his cardiac chambers too&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;and used that space as safes for hiding people&#x2019;s documents.</p> <p>Both Raghu and Ganya owed him money. And neither could pay him back. So they stood up and started a brisk walk away from Lala. Lala, with his husky loud voice first, caught up to them in spite of an ancillary tummy dangling from his torso.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Stop. I am not here to ask money from you, you fools.&#x201D;</p> <p>Both Raghu and Ganya stopped.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Have you seen Paka around?&#x201D;</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Must be at his home.&#x201D; Raghu shot back.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>You think I did not try that? I went to his home and he is not there,&#x201D; Lala lambasted.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>No idea, in that case, about where he is. I did hear that he saw a ghost yesterday. So maybe he has run away from Tikwadi.&#x201D; Raghu informed.</p> <p>Ganya raised his eyebrows and howled,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Paka did not see any ghost, and this idiot did not hear it from anyone. He only heard it from Paka, or so he says.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Then why the fuck does he say that he heard?&#x201D; Lala shrieked. Ganya shrugged.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Anyway, I think he has a ghost living in his house itself,&#x201D; Lala theorised.</p> <p>Neither Raghu nor Ganya spoke a word. They just stared at Lala in an expectation that he might clarify this theory further.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>That lady living with him? She is no lesser that a witch.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Of course.&#x201D;</em> They spurted out exactly at the same time.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Indeed she is. What did she do now by the way?&#x201D;</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Well, I went there to ask my money back. That witch managed to pull another <span class="small-caps">&#x20B9;100</span> from me. And also a monthly business, I am afraid&#x201D;</p> <p>Both Raghu and Ganya instantly flattened their hands to smash them together, all in full respect for this godly lady. Realising they have made Lala aware, they stopped. And gave him a puzzled look.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Don&#x2019;t ask. But hear me out anyway.&#x201D;</p> <hr /> <p>I reached Paka&#x2019;s house pretty early in the morning, I knew he always left his home early. But he had already left. He loves his bus more than his lady, I tell you.</p> <p>Anyway, I reach there and catch his wife squatting in her front-yard, milking her goats.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Howdy Bindu,&#x201D; I greet her and ask,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Where is Paka?&#x201D;</p> <p>She was startled as if no human had ever greeted her. So much so that she sprayed some milk on me. I felt even the goat looked at me and chuckled with a shake of her head.</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>He is not here&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;has left for work.&#x201D;</em> I saw a fly strolling over the craggy surface of her face.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>So early? Must be to his second wife, no?&#x201D; I attempted to crack a joke. She was not impressed. I attempted a cover-up,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-d
ouble">&#x201C;</span>I mean his bus.&#x201D; Even the fly on her face need not change the course as it continued its trek.</p> <p>She howled, <em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>What do you want?&#x201D;</em> This time the fly did fly away.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>My money that Paka owes me.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>He has not left any money at home.&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Well, it has been very long since I have lent him the money. I won&#x2019;t go home empty-handed today,&#x201D; I looked around and pointed to the top subconsciously.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>I am taking your tin shelter.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Our house does not have any, you took away the last one last month. It is all grass and mud now. Take that if you want.&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Bah. What will I do with that?&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>How will I know? I do not do the business of selling mud and grass.&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Duh. Is there any idiot who does that?&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x201C;<em>Well, you sold us the mud and grass when you took our tins last time.&#x201D;</em> The goat shook her head again. I was not liking it one bit.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Whatever. I have come out of my house, I need to take something. Anything. Your goat. Aha. Yes, I will take your goat.&#x201D; The goat yawned and looked away. I am still not sure if it did that in fright or disgust.</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Ok, pay me <span class="small-caps">&#x20B9;100</span> and take the goat away?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Tchah. Why the hell should I pay you anything?&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Well, it&#x2019;s your goat now. And I have just milked her,&#x201D;</em> she said pointing at the bucket full of milk. <em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>You will anyway take the milk too with you and sell it, making more moolah. So you owe me a <span class="small-caps">&#x20B9;100</span> for my service.&#x201D;</em></p> <p>The goat bleated, mocking me.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Ok. I will deduct the amount from what you already owe me.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Nah. I do not do business on credit. You have to pay me right now, and take the goat away.&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Ok. here&#x2019;s your <span class="small-caps">&#x20B9;100</span>,&#x201D; I opened my briefcase, prepared a document and handed it to her,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Now I own this goat, sign here.&#x201D;</p> <p>Bindu wiggled and wiped her wet hands, took the papers and put her initials.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>There you go,&#x201D; I sounded triumphed. Sigh. Little did I know what the hell I was getting into.</p> <p>I failed miserably to manoeuvre the goat, it just wouldn&#x2019;t budge. It kept lazily munching on the grass, idly looking at me every now and then. Its chomps were dull, eyes were dull. Its whole body was still as death, the only thing moving was its frothy mouth.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Well, it won&#x2019;t move,&#x201D; I complained</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Well, it&#x2019;s yours,&#x201D;</em> Bindu quipped.</p> <p><em>That witch, she must have done some sorcery.</em> Realising what a big mess I had gotten myself into, I said,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>I can&#x2019;t take your goat. You keep it.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Well, how can I keep it. I have already signed the document stating it is your goat.&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Never mind. Keep it.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>How can I? That would mean I am servicing you again, I am taking care of <em>your</em> goat. That will cost you extra.&#x201D;</p> <p><em>That witch. And her goat</em>.</p> <hr /> <p>Lala sputtered,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>So, next time you meet Paka, tell him I am never lending him any money again.&#x201D;</p> <p>In their minds, Raghu and Ganya were already in search of a place where they would one day hoist the statue of Bindu. That would be Tikwadi&#x2019;s own Statue of Liberty.</p> <hr /> <p>This is a second part in the series of short series about Adventures of Tikwadi. First part <a href="https://crossingenres.com/the-lone-conductor-191696de034b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was also published</a> as part of the publication <a href="https://crossingenres.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crossing Genres</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Such a refreshing edit this published as part of Sunday Review at The New York Times. The contrast between people&#x2019;s real lives and ones as perceived by their<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>friends&#x201D; on social media is so succinctly articulated by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz. Especially evident is the side of us exposed to Facebook as against Google (the search engine).</p> <blockquote> <p>Alone with a screen and anonymous, people tend to tell Google things they don&#x2019;t reveal to social media; they even tell Google things they don&#x2019;t tell to anybody else. Google offers digital truth serum. The words we type there are more honest than the pictures we present on Facebook or Instagram.<br /> <br /> Sometimes the contrasts in different data sources are amusing. Consider how wives speak about their husbands.<br /> <br /> On social media, the top descriptors to complete the phrase<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>My husband is &#x2026;&#x201D; are<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>the best,&#x201D;<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>my best friend,&#x201D;<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>amazing,&#x201D;<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>the greatest&#x201D; and<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>so cute.&#x201D; On Google, one of the top five ways to complete that phrase is also<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>amazing.&#x201D; So that checks out. The other four:<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>a jerk,&#x201D;<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>annoying,&#x201D;<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>gay&#x201D; and<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>mean.</p> </blockquote> <p>I just could not have put this is in a better way. The fakeness of what streams at Facebook has always been at the crux of the platform being disliked by a vocal minority, especially the geeks. It won&#x2019;t be too much of a stretch for the argument to say if it is not fake, it is not visible on the Facebook timeline.</p> <p>How does one protect oneself from getting miserable at the hands of this streaming pile of curated noise?</p> <blockquote> <p>Once you&#x2019;ve looked at enough aggregate search data, it&#x2019;s hard to take the curated selves we see on social media too seriously. Or, as I like to sum up what Google data has taught me: We&#x2019;re all a mess.<br /> <br /> Now, you may not be a data scientist. You may not know how to code in R or calculate a confidence interval. But you can still take advantage of big data and digital truth serum to put an end to envy &#x2014; or at least take some of the bite out of it.<br /> <br /> Any time you are feeling down about your life after lurking on Facebook, go to Google and start typing stuff into the search box. Google&#x2019;s autocomplete will tell you the searches other people are making. Type in<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>I always &#x2026;&#x201D; and you may see the suggestion, based on other people&#x2019;s searches,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>I always feel tired&#x201D; or<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>I always have diarrhea.&#x201D; This can offer a stark contrast to social media, where everybody<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>always&#x201D; seems to be on a Caribbean vacation.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yep, the best lifehack I have read in a long long time. Amen.</p>

<p>Sam sat there in the corner looking at his fingernails. With a shrapnel in his hand, he was digging the dirt, which only he could see, out his fingernails. He looked up for a moment, and then looked around. Nothing much had changed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It had been so long since he had locked himself up in this damp room on that fateful day that he had lost a sense of time. This was his personal man cave before that. This was a space where he ran all the experiments, all the projects that his day-to-day job did not allow him. He spent most of his out-of-office hours in this room living a life he always dreamt of living. That was before the epidemic engulfed the town. He never dreamt of living a day like today outside of a reel projected on a movie screen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And since that day, he had been to no place else. The room has been his attic and his living room. His kitchen and his bathroom. It has been his world, his universe. And the light bulb dangling in the centre has been the sun around which his life revolved. The quietude lent an altogether different perspective to Sam. All the perennial void was his vast canvas; and the numbing silence his music room. His imagination brushed the canvas with glittery moments from his past life and slippery periods that could never check in. He laced it with his creations from the instrument-less music.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had been directing this fancied life for so long now that time was not the only thing he had lost the sense of — it was reality too. His world was full of personalities and voices; he could no longer distinguish which ones were real and which ones were just the makings of his mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>They are coming, Sam.</em> Sam heard the voices speak. He was startled out of his dirt-digging exercise by some stutters outside, back to the reality. At least his perceived reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Who do you mean by <span class="pull-single">‘</span>they’?” Sam queried. He was still searching for the source of the voices, his eyes staggering all around the room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>You know very well who are coming.</em> Sam knew to whom the voices were referencing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the day epidemic broke out, the world all around had been a raw hunting ground. And Sam had somehow managed to lock himself away from the walkers and the hunters outside. All he knew was no one worked in dark as if the darkness could hide the savagery of the fear all around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>And if you are to survive, you need to switch the light bulb off. Rather just shatter it</em>, the voices were growing more authoritative now. <em>You can’t keep it glowing when you know that’s the way they can find you.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Yes, that’s the only way someone can find me,” Sam repeated. He looked at the light bulb that was still shimmering, blanketing the darkness. <span class="pull-double">“</span>But that’s my sun,” he quipped.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shuttering noises outside were growing, getting closer. Sam kept leering at his sun, and his universe. Grinning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Whaam</em>. The sun was killed and so was the canvas for Sam’s life that he had so merrily painted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>There is no light anywhere Commander. Safe to quarantine.” A voice was heard as the army moseyed past the room.</p>

			 <p>There is a great edit on Ars Technica about<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>The secret lives of Google raters&#x201D;. I found the section on how there always are some people, humans, behind all the <span class="small-caps">AI</span> Google, and Facebook, want to harp about. Following passage is a sheer eye-opener.</p> <blockquote> <p><span class="small-caps">UCLA</span> Information Studies professor Sarah Roberts has been studying the lives of raters for the past five years, traveling from California to the Philippines to interview workers. She told Ars that one constant in all their stories is that these workers feel isolated from the companies like Google and Facebook, even though most of their work benefits them. Some say that they know they work for Google, but Google doesn&#x2019;t know they work there.<br /> <br /> Roberts believes that big companies like Google want to keep raters hidden, largely because they like to boast about how many tasks they handle with <span class="small-caps">AI</span>.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Actually their AIs are people in the Philippines,&#x201D; she told Ars by phone.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Are there algorithms in all these tasks? Sure. Is it 100 percent? Not even close. There&#x2019;s some kind of profit motive behind these claims [about how] machines and algorithms run the show.&#x201D;</p> </blockquote> <p>The plight of these raters is real. For all the advancements in <span class="small-caps">AI</span> and automation, there is always some<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>dirty&#x201D; work that&#x2019;s deemed too unimportant, too trivial, to only be pushed<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>down&#x201D; to humans. The trend is disquieting.</p>

<p>Pia looked at the screen again and then looked down at her boarding pass. <span class="pull-double">“</span>AI-245”, she hummed, scrolling the screen flashing the flight numbers with her eyes. She was getting edgy unable to find the flight number on the list. She had long stopped relaxing in the passenger lounge. She had been standing right under the screen for last 20 minutes, every now and then darting her eyes at the Air India kiosk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Such careless attitude</em>, <em>not an iota of professionalism</em>, her heart snapped and sank. <em>Should have listened to Rini and booked United</em>, a thought loomed in her mind. It receded, even before it could linger. <em>Well, better late than getting boarded and then dragged out</em>, she heard her mind chuckle. She liked that — it had been long since it had expressed anything but grief.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Hello, Pia.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pia turned around and went completely deadpan. <span class="pull-double">“</span>Om? What are you doing here?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Om looked down at his shoe, scratching at the floor. Pia had her questioning eyes fixated at him. <span class="pull-double">“</span>Will you please come with me for a moment Pia,” he finally replied.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>What games is fate playing with me now?</em> Pia pondered. She crossed her arms and quipped, <span class="pull-double">“</span>Now? Where? You do know that I have a flight to catch, right? And anyway we met, what, like an hour back. You people gave me a send-off. Remember?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Yes, we did,” Om was still looking at his shoe. He finally kicked the floor as if dusting it of some invisible mud and stepped ahead. <span class="pull-double">“</span>But there is something really important I need to talk to you about.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pia kept looking at him, crossing her arms tighter across her chest. She wanted to scream at him, but words had suddenly deserted her. She finally gave up on her struggle to conjure them, took her luggage and walked outside with him. They walked, and then walked some more. Neither of them wanted to break the tension that the silence had woven between them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once they reached a quiet hillock, Pia looked back at Om, her eyes searching for answers on his face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>There is a burden on my heart Pia,” Om muttered, <span class="pull-double">“</span>which I need to offload. Else I would be crushed beneath it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her eyes grew wide with her fists closing tighter. Then they narrowed, watery, across her slanted face, as if questioning <em>Why are you doing this, Om?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Please don’t go, Pia.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simple words, but they carried a baggage that made them loaded enough to take Pia aback. She looked around, dazed, and then somehow managed to stutter her first words since minutes that felt like an eternity, <em><span class="pull-double">“</span>No, don’t.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No words followed post that. Om blanked out. Pia, nonplussed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both were startled back to reality by a firework that brushed a multi-coloured spider across the sky. <span class="pull-double">“</span>Looks like a multi-shot cake firework”, Om simpered, a smile donning across his face. <span class="pull-double">“</span>Hear me out till the fireworks last Pia. Then you can leave.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All Pia could do was nod. Her eyes, her fists, her arms had returned to normal. But as a whole, her body had gone wooden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>I have always been in awe of you, of your personality, of your nature. I still remember the day when I first met you at Rini’s home, the day that ended in a night out with <span class="pull-double">“</span>Jerry Maguire” show. I have been your friend since then, and I have never felt emptier than the last 6 months when you were away.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another firework lit the sky. Om tried to read Pia’s face, but it was still as a calm sea — there was some movement, but he could not gather what was to come.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>You are the one person I need to have around me for life, else my life would be a total mess. With you not around, everything was amiss. Well, I may not be the most handsome guy out there. I may not be one of the richest, the smartest guys out there. But..”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sound from another firework muffled Om’s next words. He cursed the timing, he did not want his last words to linger around any longer. So he attempted to override the effect the firework had.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>But I am confident that I will be the one person that will care for you more than anyone has ever cared for someone else.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Om paused to let the words sink, to see if they had any effect on Pia. She stayed unmoved. He continued, dejection apparent in his voice, <span class="pull-double">“</span>Last 6 months have, professionally, been the most fruitful ones for me, but I wasn’t happy. Because I could not share the joy with you. I had the world to cheer me Pia, but I was crying inside.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Firework lit the skies again — this time, Om appreciated the timing. Pia had been looking at her toes for quite some time, digging the dirt out. As the firework was dying down, Om felt he saw a shimmer of a drop leave Pia’s eye and collapse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>And as I stand here on the verge of sending you off to another country, another world, I can’t imagine what my life would be without you around, ever.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Om could hear Pia whimper, but he persisted, <span class="pull-double">“</span>It would be empty, and I have seen my empty heart bleed. If you leave today, you will leave my life empty, hollow. You have always been my <em>Dorothy</em> since that first night out. You complete me, Pia. And..”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em><span class="pull-double">“</span>Yes,”</em> emerged a sound amidst the sobs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The word that he thought he heard leave Pia’s mouth left Om perplexed. <span class="pull-double">“</span>What? I don’t&nbsp;..”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Shut up you fool. Here’s <em>your</em> Dorothy saying <em>You had me at <span class="pull-single">‘</span>hello’</em>.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many fireworks engulfed the stars in the night sky. The only thing left gleaming were the tears rolling down Pia’s cheeks as she collapsed in Om’s arms.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shri sits on a roadside bench looking at the traffic as it crawls by. It is the early morning, and so is way too crowded being the peak office commute time. He looks on as vehicles drag themselves along past him. Now and again, there is that one lunatic who dares to zoom through such traffic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pedestrians walk around Shri trying to cross the road through this maniacal traffic. He sits there, staring blankly at nothing specific.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tired, he looks at the calendar he holds. There are few scribblings on today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em><span class="pull-single">‘</span>10:03 <span class="small-caps">AM</span>. A thin man wearing a red t-shirt &amp; navy blue jeans. Zebra crossing, opposite Walmart.’</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As he waits for the watch to announce 10 am, he sees a tall, thin man approaching the roadside. He’s certain that this guy is his task for the day. He watches him get closer to the roadside at the zebra crossing. The thin man looks at the cars coming his way. With each passing car, he grows antsy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shri watches him unsuccessfully try crossing the road multiple times, every time ending at the roadside again. He dares to hop on the road finally spotting a possible window for crossing. However, he realises very late he won’t be able to cross the road and turns back, barely missing the car. As he heaves his first sigh of relief, a painful screeching sound fills the whole area, followed by a loud thud. A bus has come to halt, sending the surrounding in a rusty silence followed by an eerie snarl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shri sees people rush around him, some even rushing <em>through</em> him, towards the thin man’s body lying lifeless in the pool of blood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He indolently gets up, looks at his watch. <em>10:03 <span class="small-caps">AM</span></em>. A content smile spreads across his face. He looks down at the calendar in his hand and puts a cross on today’s date. He has only one more day to cross out on this calendar and he will be a free man again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em><span class="pull-single">‘</span>2:37PM. A toned lady in a black suit. Edward lane.’</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He reads a lady described on the calendar today. And unlike the earlier 9 events, today’s event is planned in not so crowded place. He wonders how he will be a witness to an event in such a deserted location. Somewhere deep down, he hates himself for being so inquisitive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He strokes his moustache and leans back on the pavement to cogitate what tomorrow holds for him. Last 9 days have been pretty extraordinary for him. He sat through watching 9 souls leave their earthly body and embrace the fate. It wasn’t easy doing that, knowing a death is imminent — knowing the person, the location, everything, and not taking any action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he had to endure for he himself had to survive — 10 souls, 10 crosses on the calendar, and he would be back to his life. Back to his town, his home. Back to his family. Back to Riya. He can’t give up on his life. He was awarded a chance to regain his soul, decide his own fate. 10 souls from an unknown land, in return, is a very low price to pay, he reckoned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He looks up to see construction workers fitting a huge glass slab onto a wall. A nefarious smile spreads across his face again. A <span class="pull-double">“</span>how” that had clouded his mind a while back is answered. All that remains unanswered is <span class="pull-double">“</span>who”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His eyes follow the narrow lane to the corner, waiting for somebody to show up. Somebody does appear. He sees a silhouette of a lady turn around the corner — unmindful, though, of the frightened face of Shri looking back at her. He stands there frozen as the calendar, which he was clinging on to so tightly just a moment ago, tumbles from his hands.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2016/11/29/231540.html">Book Review: A Man Called Ove</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2016/11/29/231540.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2016-11-29 23:15:40 &#43;0530">Nov 29, 2016</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Very few books make me root for the central character. Ove has me hooked.. am with him for a fun ride!&#x201D; That was my update a third into the book. And boy, did this guy keep me hooked. I was with him as his past unfolded in front of me. I was with him as his present life was amended by some funny, some happy, some sad events. Above all, I was with him as this <em>grumpy old sod grew into a grumpy, but caring, grandad.</em></p> <p>Author, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6485178.Fredrik_Backman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fredrik Backman</a>, allows the characters to grow and that is the biggest reason the book worked for me. There is no haste in revealing the past or bumping into Ove&#x2019;s future. Every chapter, a short story in itself, unfolds more of Ove and the world around him. You see Ove as he is. You are slowly led to understand why he is the way he is, mostly via flashbacks. You are made to feel for the guy, made to root for him to not stay how he is. And when that happens, because you are already absorbed into Ove&#x2019;s life, you are left contented.</p> <p>Saying Ove is grumpy would be an understatement. He is on the edge always, ready to get worked up. He is disappointed in everyone around him. He feels no one is responsible enough to care for oneself - dependent on others for every little thing. He feels the world around has no respect for rules of the land, doesn&#x2019;t matter they are chalked out by Ove himself. So he takes it upon himself to make sure people are constantly reminded of that. And that&#x2019;s how he lives his life - a monotonous, misanthropic one&#xA0;. And as Ove is planning to end his troubles with his life, fate has just the opposite planned for him &#x2014; to add just enough goodness in Ove&#x2019;s life to thaw the bitterness.</p> <p>The book maintains a wry sense of humor throughout. It made me laugh out loud at multiple instances. Especially, the way Ove&#x2019;s frustrations in other people&#x2019;s incompetence are worded is an absolute masterclass. The book also maintains a deep sad undertone. It does not ever let Ove&#x2019;s sulkiness make you hate him.</p> <p>So be it through his affection towards a young boy in love or forced, but welcome attachment from the lively new neighbor or the unspoken responsibility towards the old, and may be the only friend, Ove always shows just enough warmth to make him the most likable character in a long long time. Or in Sonja, Ove&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s words,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span><em>the strangest superhero I have ever heard about</em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span>.</p> <p>Go welcome this guy, and the gang, into your life. He will make you smile, guffaw, shed a tear and, above all, enlighten you towards life. A must read.</p> <p><strong>My Rating</strong>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1799722518" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 of 5 Stars</a></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oas trotted to the window to peek outside, sliding aside the recently dusted curtains. He had dusted them just an hour back, but he still found some dust on his hands. He wiggled his hands and muttered few muffled swears towards the polluting city dwellers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He went to the wash basin, took some liquid soap from the dispenser he had just refilled and washed off the dust. As a matter of fact, the dispenser did not need a refill. But a routine was the only thing that kept Oas’s life rolling. So refilling soap dispensers was one of his Sunday morning’s routine chore. As was dusting the furniture and curtains.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was also particular at being absolutely certain about things. So he washed his hands off again a couple of times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He realised he had forgotten to peek outside when we had slid the curtains aside, well, to peek outside. He also realised that not enough dust had stuck to his hands earlier to make the curtains clean. So he reached closer to the windows and gazed fixedly at the curtains as if he possessed some superpower to wipe things clean just by his stare. He wished he did. He did not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He wanted to check the weather outside, of course without letting his hands be all dusty. So he pulled an old umbrella from the cabinet and poked at the curtains, as if he was worried that the dust particles were monsters hiding behind, ready to pounce on him. He wished they were. They were not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once he was convinced that nothing will pounce on him, he used the same umbrella to slide the curtains to the side and swiftly moved closer to the window to peek outside. He instantly tumbled backwards as he saw two green shaken eyes gawking back at him. Some more muffled swear words left Oas’ mouth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oas saw the shaken eyes come back to their sleepy normal — one eye open three-fourth, another the remaining one-fourth. Both belonged to one lazy creature dwelling in their block. Oas’ neighbours called it a cat — he called it Mr.&nbsp;Boneless Marvel. <em><span class="pull-double">“</span>Marvel it is — given it belonged to no one, no one freaking cared about pets in our block and it was too lazy assed to care about itself. Still, I have never seen it lose a sliver of weight. Phenomenon. Prodigy. Miracle.”</em> Oas always advocated his case to Sara.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Marvel had a total of half eyes open now looking at Oas, chin strongly pinned on its paw. Oas attempted to shoo it away with the umbrella. It winked back at him. Oas attempted it a couple more times. It winked back a couple more times. Oas slid the curtain closed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He again realised he did not peek outside for the weather, so he slid the curtain open, ignored Mr.&nbsp;Marvel and checked the weather outside, finally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oas saw a grumpy old man peering back at him in the mirror. There were so many things Sara would not like in what reflected back. So he straightened his eyebrows, opened his eyes wide, curved his lips up into a pleasant smile and slowly flattened the visible creases on his sweater. He wished somewhere deep inside he could do the same for the wrinkles on his forehead. And the ones on his nose too. He couldn’t. So his face went back to be being grumpy again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He could be his grumpy self for some more time. As per the Sunday routine, he still had an hour to ready himself for Sara.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He finally walked outside, locked the door behind him and, of course, tugged at it a couple of times. He realised something, muttered few muffled swears again, unlocked the door and brought an umbrella back with him. He knew it would rain soon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He started ambling towards the bus stop. As he did every Sunday, he stopped next to the electronics store and inspected himself in the glass at the store front to make sure he was ready for Sara. Today, he saw Mr.&nbsp;Marvel standing next to him. He tried to recall last time he had seen it standing. He could not, so he started walking. So did it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oas wasn’t sure why it was following him. He shrieked, <em><span class="pull-double">“</span>go away, shoo”</em> waving his hand. It blinked. He wielded his umbrella almost touching its nose. It stopped, purred, licked its grey moustache and looked back at him, winking. He gave up and started walking, holding his shoulder to abate the pain from all his freakish <em>swordplay</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oas sat on the bench at the nearest bus stop. He never missed this small trip, rather he was breathing only for these Sunday walks of his. It was here that Sara had arranged for a letter to be delivered for Oas every week before she left him once and for all. It was here she narrated, via the letter, an incident from her life which she could never share with Oas while she lived.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oas hated Sara for being shrewd enough to see he would have died, or killed himself, long back if it weren’t for these beads of secrets from her life. It was now six months since she died, but Oas lived on for, and she lived on via, these letters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just as every Sunday, an unknown guy delivered a letter to Oas at <span class="small-caps">11AM</span>. Clouds crowded the skies, and Oas’ heart too. He neatly opened the letter and read on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Dearest Oas,</p><p>When I met you, I was a touchy, bitter girl with a life laden with sorrows. It was you who pulled me out of my miseries and made me see the beautiful side of life. And I realised how necessary it is to reduce pessimism from other’s life. That day onwards I lived my life just to protect you, cover you from any despairs; just as you have done for me. We have been each other’s shields.</p><p>But I saw one more soul who needed bouts of optimism, of love. And I gave him that. I know you would have never liked me doing so, but I just couldn’t see him sad. With me gone, I know you are grumpy. And so is he. So you must continue to help him, for me. Be nice to him, I am sure he too will do the same. Be each other’s shield, protecting other from pouring sorrows. Bring your Mr.&nbsp;Marvel, my Buddy, home. You need him. So does he, you.</p><p>Love, Sara”</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It had gotten a lot gloomy around. Oas looked at Mr.&nbsp;Marvel sitting, grumpy, near his legs, with its shrunken eyebrows and wrinkles all over the face. He chuckled, as the clouds suddenly started pouring down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oas pulled Mr.&nbsp;Marvel near him and covered it under his umbrella. He stood up and called out, <span class="pull-double">“</span>Come, let’s go home, Buddy.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jui raised her brows and whacked him on his shoulders. <span class="pull-double">“</span>Yes, you had made me spit the coffee out of my nose, almost. Coffee running down my nose, water running down my eyes. And then this laugh. Such an idiotic witch I must’ve looked.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>But how can you blame me? I was just trying my best to woo you. I wasn’t sure I had won you over yet.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>So you thought let me be this joker that had already made me fall in love with you?” Jui asked, rolling her eyes. <span class="pull-double">“</span>Sometimes I quiz myself what was I even thinking when I accepted your proposal.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jai was all smiles — looking at her, so full of her carefree laughter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>It was also the day you had promised you will never leave me.” He was staring at her now, smile slowly receding from their lips.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Why did you leave, Jui?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>You know why I did, Jai.” She looked down. She knew she won’t have any answer for what was to come. <span class="pull-double">“</span>You also know I didn’t want to.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>But you did.” Jai was a tad vexed now. <span class="pull-double">“</span>It’s so unfair — this should not have happened to me, to us. What wrong have I ever done?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Don’t be too hard on yourself. And you see, I am still there for you. We have made sure I will always be.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jai shrugged, <span class="pull-double">“</span>You know it is not the same anymore.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He looked back at Jui, in an attempt to read her face. But she was already looking down, eyes closed. He knew it was coming any moment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it did. <span class="pull-double">“</span>I should be going.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Promise me you will come back.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Of course, Jai. All you have to do is call.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She looked at him, looked deep into his eyes. She wondered if he will ever stop blaming himself for how their lives turned out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His eyes revealed nothing though — plain void stared back at her. Every emotion, every thought, every dream was washed away during the numerous tearful nights he had spent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She stood up. Jai watched her saunter along, <em>climb into the mirror</em> on the wall and disappear. He wished he could follow her there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he knew Jui would want him to stay back for their little princess. He looked at her — cuddled up, so calm, in her blanket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jui had promised, after all, that she would always be looking at them as long as he continued to live for their princess. <em>Their secret little mutual pact.</em></p>

			 <p>It was pitch dark across the town of Diu. The street winding down was deserted as usual. It had recently been washed off its weariness by the unseasonal rain. In a way, it was a perfect setting for one pleasant, romantic walk.</p> <p>A couple silhouetted against the discontinuous bouts of illumination from the lighthouse nearby. But their walk was no way romantic, may be a tad tipsy rather.</p> <p>Roy and Joel had been walking down the street for almost an hour. Yet their individual opinions were divided. Joel thought it must have been four hours. Roy, however, opined that he was off by at least 3 hours and 30 minutes.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>No way&#x201D; bawled Joel,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>We must be just debating this for last 2 hours.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Again, you are off by an hour and 30 minutes at the least&#x201D; Roy countered.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>How are you so sure? It&#x2019;s as if you want to stay here longer.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Of course, I do. Don&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Well, not in the shape I am now&#x201D; Joel hit back with his fiery eyes.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Anyway, shouldn&#x2019;t we be searching for what we are supposed to search?&#x201D;</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>That is exactly what I am doing&#x201D; replied Roy, peeking at the byroad they were passing by.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>I don&#x2019;t think we are searching for the same thing, though. If that were the case, you would be peeping minutely down the manholes. Not glancing at the lanes as we pass by.&#x201D;</p> <p>Roy just smiled.</p> <hr /> <p>Ganu saw the two bodies tottering along. He wasn&#x2019;t sure if it was their walk or his drunk vision that was unsteady.</p> <p>One was looking minutely at the footpaths, and in the garbage bins, and over the plant pots. He thought he also saw him once peeping inside a manhole. He was for sure searching for something.</p> <p>The other, the skinny one, was not searching for any <em>thing</em>, though.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span><em>He might well be searching for someone.</em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span> thought Ganu.</p> <p>There was something about these two people that appeared odd to Ganu. They looked unconventionally fresh for the time of the day, the season of the year, and the condition of the city. All were in shambles.</p> <p>Ganu did not like such clean people. He felt no one should be this clean when he was drowning in his sorrows.</p> <p>Ganu started following them.</p> <hr /> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>I think that guy there is following us. Is it ok if he sees us?&#x201D; asked Joel, in a worried tone.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>How would I know? I too am going through this for the first time. I, anyway, do not think anyone ever has faced this. I think even he would not know.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Of course, he would know. He is the one who sets the rules.&#x201D;</p> <p>Roy shushed Joel as he heard the muffled voices, the wailings. He walked towards the next alley&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;there was a gathering of saddened souls.</p> <p>Roy just smiled, again.</p> <hr /> <p>Ganu walked behind them to the crowd and steered himself towards the middle. He saw the back of the skinny one now, looking down at a weeping woman. And just as he saw what lay unmoving on the ground in front of her, he collapsed with his eyes wide open.</p> <hr /> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Oh, crap!&#x201D; exclaimed Death.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Now this hasn&#x2019;t happened ever.&#x201D;</p> <p>He looked at Roy, Joel, and the other souls.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Well people, the only way in now is down. Let&#x2019;s go search for that key to the heavens.&#x201D;</p>

			 <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Trust me, Sam.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>I trust you Pihu. But I can&#x2019;t believe what you just said.&#x201D; Sam was minutely observing the can Pihu had just handed him.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Ok. You don&#x2019;t have to. What worse do you think can happen?&#x201D;</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>We can die, of course. And are you really sold on the story that by gulping the contents of this can, I will live this day again, as many times as I want?&#x201D;</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Oh don&#x2019;t be a child, Sam. You are not going to die. And yes, I believe in the story.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Am I the one who is being a child? And this can resembles a plain antique mess to me.&#x201D;</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>It <em>is</em> antique, passed on for ages. It was handed down to me by grandpa. And you know he was one hell of a psychic.&#x201D; Sam knew.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Don&#x2019;t think too much, Sam. Pass on that can opener.&#x201D;</p> <hr /> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Today&#x2019;s going to be the best day of my life&#x201D;, Sam said as he sipped his coffee.</p> <p>Pihu sat there in an attempt to be attentive. She looked deep into her coffee mug as if fishing for the words to utter. She knew why he was so giddy.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>So what&#x2019;s the plan for tonight?&#x201D;, she finally asked.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>As if you don&#x2019;t know. Aren&#x2019;t you the one who booked the evening for us?&#x201D;</p> <p>She struggled to put a grin on her face. Her mind was meandering, searching for the reasons why she helped Sam this time.</p> <p>But then he considered her his best friend&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;a person, the only one for that matter, with whom he shared all the facets of his life.</p> <p>And that was the reason he had been with her right from the morning. Today was a special day for him, and he wanted her to plan it for him.</p> <p>Pihu realized this might have been the only instance when they had spent the complete day together&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;enjoyed it thoroughly in each others company.</p> <p>He had woken her up, breakfast in his hand. He had brewed the coffee while she freshened up. They munched on the sandwiches he had brought, parcelled. He cooked and they dined together as she planned the night out.</p> <p>They teased each other over their frailties. They laughed. And they played. They danced. And they eased off. They enjoyed like they never did before.</p> <p>She was happy. And boy did she plan when she was at her happy-best. Classy ride to the movies in an Uber Mercs. A rom-com with popcorns&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;platinum seats in the house. A candlelight dinner under the clear skies to sign it off. A picture-perfect evening, she thought as she patted herself.</p> <p>It dawned on her, though, that it wasn&#x2019;t her who he would finally bow down to and propose. It would be Rita.</p> <p>And this realization unsettled Pihu. She was suddenly filled with extreme rage, even as she sat there warming off in Sam&#x2019;s embrace.</p> <p>He was anticipating that the evening will make today his best day. It had already been Pihu&#x2019;s best day. She hated Sam for sharing everything, but not her feelings for him.</p> <p>She wished their day, their lives even, ended at once, with her in his cozy embrace.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>I wish I could just relive this same day again and again.&#x201D;, the words spurted from Sam&#x2019;s mouth. And Pihu&#x2019;s lips spread themselves into a mean smile.</p> <hr /> <p>Pihu opened the can, poured the black gooey contents in a glass. As Sam held it, he saw Pihu raise a toast to him.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Here&#x2019;s to the best day of our life.&#x201D;</p> <hr /> <p>This story was <a href="https://medium.com/the-weekly-knob/best-day-of-my-life-5069a5fa7cd0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first published</a> on Medium as part of the amazing publication<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span><a href="https://medium.com/the-weekly-knob?source=logo-6809a28c41a0-3fc7a9358189" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Weekly Knob</a><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span>.</p>

			 <p>Today&#x2019;s was a typical summer morning in Tikwadi. It was a calm &amp; pleasant dawn that the midnight breeze &amp; the sun-beaten land had hatched together. And like <em>every</em> typical morning&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;summer, winter or of the rainy season&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Paka sat expressionless at the window seat of his bus. His bus it was, as he was the lone conductor available in the village.</p> <p>It would not have been the case in reality though, if not for Paka. He was just smart enough to convince <em>those who appointed a conductor</em> that no person there was suitable for the job. He also convinced <em>those who wanted to get appointed as one</em> that no job there was suitable for the person.</p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>What to do? It is a selfish world out there.&#x201D; He used to say as he accepted the job&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;making him evidently look selfless.</p> <p>And <em>keeping his job as a conductor intact</em> was the only job he ever worked on. As long as he did that well, all he had to do was report to the bus depot every morning, sit at his window seat through the day and get dropped at his home at night.</p> <p>Paka had also mastered the skill of acting dumb&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;something he, of course, was not, given the fact that he had managed to keep the whole village away from his job for 5 years now. Every time someone reminded him of the work he has to do as a conductor, he would work hard to screw up hardest. He considered screwing intermittently as the part-time job, holding onto it being the primary one.</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Why don&#x2019;t you ever count the money collected?&#x201D;</em> An officer had once asked him. <em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Tomorrow, you bring it as counted.&#x201D;</em></p> <p>He reported to the officer next day with no money with him.</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Did no one travel on the bus today?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>They did. But you told me to count. I counted. I put every rupee note I received next to me in a separate pile based on their value&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;as I was taught counting in school. It seems the notes blow away if not held.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>But then why didn&#x2019;t you hold them?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Well, I can either hold the money or count it, right? I only have two hands.&#x201D;</p> <p>The officer had received <span class="small-caps">&#x20B9;700</span> less in his next salary.</p> <p>And no one dared to question Paka&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;he used to yell<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Well, find someone else suitable for this job&#x201D;. Of course, he would then be asked to simply do nothing.<br /> In that sense, he was paid to not work. Lesser he moved from his seat, more he not worked&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;more he not worked, more he was paid.</p> <hr /> <p>Not that everyone in Tikwadi was stupid, though. It was just that every individual was a master at being a fool at their work.</p> <p>Farmers sucked at farming. Carpenters sucked at carpentry. Potters sucked at pottery. Barbers sucked at <em>barbery</em>. The only people that did not suck at their jobs were operators of the water pumps. They never sucked, anything.</p> <p>Paka met all these people during the rides on his bus. And he dreaded every interaction he had with these fools out in the village.</p> <hr /> <p>Today, Paka saw Gotya coming towards his bus. He sighed. He dreaded meeting Gotya the most. Gotya was a herder. Of course, he sucked at herding his goats. But that was not why Paka dreaded him. Gotya was one of the most foolish ones out there &amp; he made Paka work like no one ever did.</p> <p>He knew it was going to be a hectic day for him.</p> <p>Gotya hopped onto the bus. <em>And so did his five goats after him.</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Goats are not allowed on the bus.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Where is it written?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Here&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;right above me.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>You know I can&#x2019;t read, right? Read it for me.&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Goats are not allowed on the bus.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Don&#x2019;t tell me. Read for me from where is it written.&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>I just read for you from where it is written.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Then why is there a picture of a cigarette on the board &amp; not of a goat?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>It says goats are allowed if they are smoking.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>You did not read so when I asked you to read from where it was written.&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Goats are not allowed on the bus unless they are smoking.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>What if I am smoking?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Smoking is not allowed on the bus.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>But then how can goats travel while smoking?&#x201D;</em></p> <p><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Well, don&#x2019;t ask me. I don&#x2019;t make these rules.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Lucky bastards.

			 <p>He walked back into the room, <em>alone</em>. He fancied such days. He was on his personal day-off when everyone else was at work. He had just finished his last chore.</p> <p>He did not remember the last time he had lived an afternoon so empty&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;empty in a good sense it was&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;empty because he didn&#x2019;t have any items to cross off his planner. He was idle, <em>and he was loving it</em>.</p> <p>He closed the curtains to darken the room, turned on the switch and waved his hand to affirm he had the air-cooler lined to his liking. He settled on his chair, crossed his legs on to the desk, put his arms behind his head and <em>admired the emptiness, the freedom the day was offering him</em>.</p> <p>He closed his eyes and gasped out a smug sigh. He was waiting patiently for the doorbell to ring.</p> <hr /> <h3 id="about-an-hour-ago">About an hour ago</h3> <p>He had a chore to deal with. He got on to the bike, kicked the side-stand and pushed the ignition switch. He looked at the crumbled paper in his hand, the notes he had made for himself. He still had time at his hand.</p> <p>He began driving to <em>the</em> home. He looked around him. The city looked empty to him, <em>just as he liked it</em>. He was&#x2019;t surprised as it was extremely hot out there. As if the sun was seething with anger <em>over the thankless job</em> he got to do, with no day-off from. He was conscious of the feeling, but he didn&#x2019;t worry about it today.</p> <p>About some minutes drive and he reached <em>the</em> home. It was a steep walk of four floors through the staircase. But he knew he just had to get it done with - then he can enjoy the freedom, in just the way he wanted, <em>with just the one he wanted</em>.</p> <p>He was, after all, waiting patiently for quite some time now. He knew soon his doorbell will ring.</p> <hr /> <p>Eyes closed, his mind fell asleep. His ears though were awake in attention. The doorbell hadn&#x2019;t even outed its first ring that he was on his sole. He dashed to the door and, <em>panting visibly</em>, opened it.</p> <p>He saw a tired, young man standing there. He realised it was extremely hot out there. He thought the other guy must have been running around the town in this heat to sweat so profusely. Such a <em>thankless</em> life full of <em>hardships</em>, he thought.</p> <p>He pitied the other guy for his condition and thanked god for the freedom he was bestowed upon.</p> <p>Anyway, all he cared about at this moment was the smartphone the other guy was here to deliver.</p> <hr /> <p>He saw a panting, young man open the door. He realised the other guy was alone in there&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;in an empty house, with no one to talk to. Such a <em>futile</em> life full of <em>loneliness</em>, he thought.</p> <p>He pitied the other guy for his condition and thanked god for the freedom he was bestowed upon.</p> <p>Anyway, all he cared about at this moment was to deliver this parcel and reach home to welcome his wife, back from her mother&#x2019;s place.</p> <hr /> <p>This story <a href="https://crossingenres.com/the-other-b0256568cdd5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can also be read at</a> the awesome publication<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Crossing (G)enres&#x201D;.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's an interesting idea in principle. But it would not work in reality. Here are my few quick thoughts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="whynot">Why Not!</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think it would be interesting to follow the positive effects of this <em>"forced limitation"</em> — things that might make this experiment succeed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Writing might be fun because people would have time to mature the thought, an idea <em>and</em> word them in exactly the format they want them in.</li><li>Reading might be fun because there is no urgency to stay on top of the current happenings. Messages don’t become stale if not consumed and commented on as the event is happening.</li><li>What a person writes about and how he words them would be anticipated. <em>Patience is a virtue that is dying a slow death</em> amongst the people socially active today. If forced, it might allow to pull the reins back a tad.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="whynot">Why Not.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However the limitations would force the user to see the not-so-good side of the social interaction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Both for writers and readers, the urgency of publishing and consuming would shift from the time of event to the time of publication.</li><li>The message delivery time cannot be decided to be a fixed time for all — a sort of broadcasting duration. Because not every person has the same consumption pattern. They vary a lot, making the delivery time further complex.</li><li>The behavior is very similar to a daily/weekly news digest. Anticipation lasts in the initial phases, wades out slowly as the unread messages mount up. Rather, the dying patience makes this experiment further difficult to succeed.</li></ul>

			 <p>Emma Watson gave an impassioned and effective speech at the U.N. headquarters in New York. The address was as part of the launch of <a href="http://www.heforshe.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>HeForShe&#x201D; campaign</a>.</p> <p>Overall speech from the U.N. Women Goodwill Ambassador is a must watch &#x2014; not only for the fact that it was highly applauded &amp; admired, but for a fresh view towards Feminism.</p> <p>I was especially gratified to hear her speak on why gender equality is an issue, and a cause of concern, for men too.</p> <blockquote> <p>Gender equality is your issue too. Because to-date, I have seen my father&#x2019;s role as a parent being valued less by the society &#x2014; despite my needing his presence as a child as much as my mother&#x2019;s. I&#x2019;ve seen men suffering from mental illness unable to ask for help for fear it will make them less of man.(&#x2026;) I have seen men made fragile and insecure by distorted sense of what constitutes male success.<br /> <br /> Men don&#x2019;t have the benefits of equality either. We don&#x2019;t talk often about men being imprisoned by gender stereotypes. But they are. And when they are free, things will change for women as a natural consequence.<br /> <br /> If men don&#x2019;t have to be aggressive in order to be accepted, women won&#x2019;t feel compelled to be submissive. If men don&#x2019;t have to control, women won&#x2019;t have to be controlled. Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong.<br /> <br /> It is time we all <em>perceive gender on a spectrum instead of two sets of opposing ideals</em>. If we stop defining each other by what we are not and start defining ourselves by who we are, we can all be freer.</p> </blockquote> <p>Complex topics are rarely worded more succinctly. Respect for Emma Watson and empathy for the gender equality fight has risen manifolds in my mind.</p> <p>Do watch the complete video and contemplate.</p> <div style="width:0;height:0"> </div><div class="videoContainer" style="padding-bottom:56.5%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gkjW9PZBRfk?rel=0&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

			 <h2 id="typical-trilogy.-starts-well.-goes-haywire.-falls-flat.">Typical Trilogy. Starts well. Goes haywire. Falls flat.</h2> <p>Such a letdown by the finale. Last third of the book completely ruined the build-up &#x2014; which itself wasn&#x2019;t too great. But this could have been so much better if the author did not fall for the pressure to jack up the number of pages &#x2014; the effort, to stretch the story unnecessarily, clearly shows.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s all about the impending war. Amish can write battles well. But he struggled to put the battles together into an interesting story. Towards the end it was just a drag. There was no thrill, there was no surprise, there was no story remaining. It was just an attempt to conclude the trilogy, a miserable attempt at best.</p> <p>There are too many characters, each seeking a closure of his own - leading to too many unnecessary side stories. Further surprising is no character behaves the way you expect them to behave. <em>Parvateshwar</em> doesn&#x2019;t. _Ganesh_doesn&#x2019;t. Even <em>Shiva</em> doesn&#x2019;t - the biggest issue.</p> <p>Sigh. It is not easy to close mystery trilogies. And the frustration at not being clear on how to do so, for <em>Shiva</em>, shows from the plot that unravels &#x2014; left me fuming.</p> <hr /> <h3 id="spoilers-ahead">Spoilers Ahead</h3> <p><em>A side note on the overall series</em>, I am completely baffled by how the tile &amp; summary of the novels set complete different expectations than what the actual plot delivers. It applies for all 3 &#x2014; realised first with <em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>The Secret of Nagas&#x201D;</em>.</p> <p>There was no secret of or from <em>Nagas</em> that was significant to earn a title. This one goes further ahead. At least in the second one, <em>Nagas</em> had significant role. Here, <em>Vayuputras just have no f-ing role at all</em>. It could very well have been some smart brahmin who owned the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>nuclear&#x201D; weapon and it would not have mattered a whit. <em>And Oath?</em> Which f-ing oath are you talking about? Plot goes on irrespective of it exists or not. In fact, one <em>Shiva</em> gives <em>Mithra</em>, he so uncharacteristically breaks.</p> <p>Sigh! Every word in summary is to hype up the mystery. Titles are completely baseless. <em>Not the right precedent this</em>.</p> <p>My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1474308339" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 of 5 stars</a></p>

			 <p>A great fun read with extremely witty subplots is how I remember this book. But then I think about it a bit and <em>it is not how I felt throughout</em>.</p> <p>It is extremely slow, occasionally (<em>just</em>) funny in the initial half. It does have that moment of <em>laugh-out-loud</em> humour in between&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;but slow nonetheless. So much so that I had lost the interest in between. It was as if jokes were written around characters (mostly caricatures) and thrown in. And the pages filled in describing the fantasy land and the surroundings were too much at times. But that is before the plot picks up and fun kicks in again.</p> <p>The novel is sheer pleasure after that. I couldn&#x2019;t put it down and wanted to know what happens next. Frankly, more than what happens, I was interested in <em>how</em> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1654.Terry_Pratchett" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Terry Pratchett</em></a> <em>words it</em>. I have realised that Pratchett is a master of witty fantasies. It was not that rare when I used to pause and admire how unnaturally a feeling (like fear, anger&#xA0;, etc.) can be described without sounding stupid. If there ever was a university of metaphors, Pratchett would surely be the founder of that. <em>And he would still be teaching a course on thinking big&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;weird, but big</em>.</p> <p>So here I am confounded for the first time after reading a book. Do I like the book, the story or do I like the way it is often spun? And it turns out I find the book to be just <span class="small-caps">OK</span>. But then I would pick it up any day, go back to my highlighted passages and <em>admire the mastery at work</em>.</p> <p>And just for this master Pratchett, I will pick up another of the Discworld novels soon and start taking notes.</p> <p>My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1241793850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 of 5 stars</a></p>

<p>Every time I read an article online that grabs by attention and interest, I am faced with a dilemma. I feel am gaining something without compensating for what is due to the writer or/and the owner of the website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I run Ads-block extension. Well, the web publishers are themselves to blame. Look at the following tweet from me and I hope you feel the pain (i.e. if you do not, already).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:core-embed/twitter {"url":"[twitter.com/_am1t/sta...](https://twitter.com/_am1t/status/588581200207347713)","type":"rich","providerNameSlug":"twitter","className":""} -->

</div></figure>
<!-- /wp:core-embed/twitter -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So I am one less revenue node for the ads-driven sites out there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I will not be able to pay the subscription price for every individual site I want to visit. That’s like watching, and paying for, television channels <em>á la carte</em>. What worsens the web scenario even further is there are zillions of <em>channels</em> out there instead of few hundreds. And everyone might create just that one interesting episode instead of a long drawn series.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So here's the situation as it stands then.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I do not want to see the ads</strong>. Majority, <em>including me</em>, cannot pay for subscriptions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ads are hated — considered, <em>and rightly so</em>, blots on the web. <strong>Subscriptions are costly, unaffordable.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What choice are the web publishers left with then?</p>

<p>It made me realise, for the zillionth time, passwords are mess. This medium of authenticating a valid, and a human, user has overstayed its welcome. The way it is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160304020352/http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/01/22/_25_worst_passwords_what_your_terrible_common_password_says_about_you.html">being</a> <a href="http://gizmodo.com/the-25-most-popular-passwords-of-2013-god-help-us-1504852434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used</a> is not secure. Well, can you blame the poor souls who are made to remember the crazy letters every time they want to get something done online? Moreover, they are forced, as a security policy, to change and then remember the new passwords every some time. Sigh! Indeed, passwords are mess.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You need more proof? Try searching for the phrase <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=passwords+should+die" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“passwords should die”</a>. This farce has to be one of the most cursed phenomenon out there.</p>

<h3 id="butthenwhataretheoptions">But then what are the options?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Make browsers/OS’es handle the <strong>password generation and management</strong>: This is one of the oldest and most recommended solution for this issue. The problem is such machine generated passwords are usually random Strings; hence they are extremely hard to memorise. Good password managers <a href="https://diogomonica.com/posts/password-security-why-the-horse-battery-staple-is-not-correct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can negate</a> that need. However, they become a hinderance in an environment where there are multiple machines involved (for example, work vs home environment). Moreover, the security aspect of these are <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/7/4597018/google-chrome-saved-browser-passwords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hotly debated topics</a>.</li><li>Recommend ways for <strong>easy to remember, difficult to break</strong> passwords: An option that is evaluated a lot these days. The xkcd post linked above recommended one such way. It also opened a lot of threads <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/6095/xkcd-936-short-complex-password-or-long-dictionary-passphrase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussing</a> and <a href="http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/936:_Password_Strength" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analysing</a> the accuracy and feasibility of the same. There were <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/security/how-to/a8650/solving-the-password-problem-14993917/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">articles</a> and <a href="http://www.isi.edu/natural-language/mt/memorize-random-60.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">papers</a> written on understanding and improving on the suggested way. The problem is, eventually, it is a human, the lazy ass, who will decide what the password would be. What would end up happening is instead of <em>”password1”</em> being a common password, it would be <em>”mypasswodiscommon”</em>.</li><li>Go <strong>Biometric</strong>: Apple introduced a working and, debatably, secure implementation of biometric authentication in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_ID" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TouchId</a>. By bundling it as a core feature of iPhone, Apple made it reach to the masses. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/fingerprints-as-passwords-new-iphone-touch-id-gets-mixed-security-verdict/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tons</a> of <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/09/will-apples-touch-id-make-fingerprints-happen.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">articles</a> were written detailing how it can solve the password problem altogether. Though possible, issue remains this would not happen until biometric authentication comes bundled across all technology devices, <em>even the low-end mobile phones</em>. Passwords remain the standard, and only acceptable authentication method till then.</li><li>Make <strong>passwords die</strong>, altogether: Finally, we come to the most interesting option that can be driven by the application developers themselves and not the users of the application. I feel, this will eventually become a reality.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="passwordlessauthentication">Password-less Authentication</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lot has been said on this front too. There are <a href="https://medium.com/@ninjudd/passwords-are-obsolete-9ed56d483eb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">articles</a> and even open source frameworks, like <a href="https://passwordless.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Passwordless</a> that want to target this by providing application developers ways to replace their login forms with password-less access. At high-level, key steps involved to achieve this are</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Make a user just mention his userid/email address</li><li>Generate a one-time token for him</li><li>Deliver it to him</li><li>Authenticate him with the generated token</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are pretty standard and well accepted steps. However the issue remains in the 3rd step, <em>how should these tokens be delivered</em>. Whichever mechanism one selects will become <em>the single point of threat</em> to the whole system going haywire, be it then email (<em>what’s the password for email account then?</em>) or SMS (<em>phone is lost, what now?</em>). The <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4308190" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hacker news thread</a> on <a href="http://notes.xoxco.com/post/27999787765/is-it-time-for-password-less-login" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one such suggested system</a> is nice rundown for the probable issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that thread is more than a couple of years old. Today, the best option would be to deliver the token to the device which has biometric authentication enabled. As an example, I really like the way Apple has enabled the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two-factor authentication</a> on Apple Id. It displays possible devices where the token can be delivered and asks the user to select one. Once delivered to, say, an iPhone, <em>only the user who owns the iPhone</em> can access it by authenticating himself with TouchId. This same mechanism can be applied for delivering the secure tokens of web/mobile applications too. There, the delivery problem is solved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, given that majority of the users do not own an iPhone or a similar biometric authentication enabled device, this method cannot become the primary way of authenticating users.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So even though I believe that, in <a href="http://hypercritical.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Siracusa’</a> words, <em>on an infinite timescale</em>, all applications will have password-less logins, we are some years away from realising that dream.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ok, so what till then? This is what I would like the applications developers to do to make this password mess a bit less itchy for me. Decide first, do you really need me to secure my profile via a password? User forums/discussion groups, I am looking at you. I will give leeway to banks/financial apps to make me remember and enter the password. For all others, please make this process simple.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>When a user visits the first time, ask for his email id/mobile number. Next, make him choose a word, an image or, preferably, a set of words/images to remember as <em>“password”</em>.</li><li>For every subsequent visit, just ask him for the email id or mobile number. Even better, <em>just do not ask him anything</em>. Maintain his profile information in cookie with expiration set for a longer timeframe.</li><li>Give him the options amongst which lies his password and make him <em>“select”</em>, not enter, that as the password. He gets a couple of chances, else make him fall back to one-time token.</li><li>If he does not remember the <em>chosen</em> password, <em>or chooses not to</em>, a click on a link sends him a token on email/mobile which he used while registering.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I believe this will ease the burden from majority of the people of maintaining the passwords without making them any less secure. Passwords can’t die yet, but at least <em>they would be a little less painful</em>.</p>

			 <p>This novel has left me with a lot of thoughts. First off, I am totally confused on what I really feel about this. It is one of the most difficult books I found to review. So I just won&#x2019;t. I do not think I would be able to word my thoughts well. Well, they are confused.</p> <p>So I would instead refer to one review that I completely concur with. Thomas has done a great job <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1019162825" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviewing</a> this at Goodreads. Here&#x2019;s how he describes the style of prose in the novel, the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>survival&#x201D; journey of Mark Watney.</p> <blockquote> <p>Watney discovers a problem. Watney worries for a sentence or two. Watney comes up with a solution. Watney enacts the solution with minimal struggle. Watney celebrates. Rinse and repeat.</p> </blockquote> <p>There, Thomas has described what goes on in 75% of the pages. Sigh! This guy Watney is an unbelievable genius. No trouble or challenge is big for him. He glides over every challenge as one would with a game of toys. Actually that&#x2019;s exactly how Andy Weir, the author, writes this; as if he is Andy from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toy Story</a> spinning an action-drama around Woody during his play time. Throw anything at him, he would have the smarts, the resources and the luck with him to soar out of it. And you know right that at the beginning of every log Watney writes.</p> <p>There lies the novel&#x2019;s biggest drawback. It just has one tone, <em>the tone of success</em>. And you can&#x2019;t build a thriller if the reader is just not thrilled for the protagonist.</p> <p>To sum up, this is what Thomas has to say.</p> <blockquote> <p>My overall thoughts on The Martian center on its lack of introspection and repetitive descriptions of action, its disconcerting lack of characterization, and the drought of struggle each of the characters underwent. Watney faces a difficult situation, but I at no point in my entire reading thought he would suffer, based on his Pollyanna tone.</p> </blockquote> <p>Completely agree. I do not think Andy Weir wanted to write a thriller about a Martian. He wanted to jot down his thoughts on what will it take scientifically for a guy to survive on Mars. And the novel is a breezy light log of these thoughts. You can skim through it without getting involved, like any science paper/theory you read.</p> <p>All said, this is a nice fleet of thoughts, dreams of Andy Weir. The efforts that Andy Weir <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Weir_(writer)#Writing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has put in</a> that <em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>included extensive research into orbital mechanics, conditions on Mars, the history of manned spaceflight, and botany&#x201D;</em> for the novel shows. A one time read for sure just for that. Just don&#x2019;t look for a thriller in this and you should be fine.</p> <p>My rating: <em>3 of 5 stars</em></p>

			 <p>I read a paperback recently; an incident that made me realise how wrong I had been to believe one will always feel nostalgic towards books with real paper. There indeed was a time when I used to look down on eBooks as format. I knew I wasn’t alone, <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=real+books+vs+ebooks+debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the debate</a> was on. I used to think reading them is futile, a fleeting pleasure. A pathway for a lazy few; the ones who do not appreciate the feel of a paperback in their hands.</p> <p>That was before Kindle happened.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2021/a04cdafb87.jpg" alt="kindle"></p> <h2 id="ebooks-all-the-way">EBooks all the way</h2> <p>It was gradually that I started rejoicing eBooks. It was via the Kindle app first, mostly on my iPad. The <em>built in dictionary</em> was one of the most useful feature that pulled me in. It helps a lot when a person, not well-versed in English, can simply select a word to fathom its meaning. No need stretching out to fetch a dictionary and scan for the word. Either that or to make some broken sense out of the sentence without knowing the word. Not an experience one can call satisfactory.</p> <p>There was another feature that I benefitted from the most, <em>sync to the furthest read position</em>. Be it an iPad, iPhone or the Kindle web reader extension, be it home, office or a lengthy queue of a supermarket, my book was always available, synced to where I had left it earlier. There is some relief in not maintaining a physical book and the nosy bookmarks. They are played with, they are misplaced, they are lost. They even are hinderance sometimes, often when you are in-fact reading. (Isn’t that generally a time one holds a book anyway?)</p> <p>eBooks came handy. But there was still an issue I faced. <em>iPads were heavy, iPhones tiny</em>. Paperbacks (mostly) are best by size and weight. You hold them, read even at a stretch and don’t feel you have lost a limb. With iPads? Well, they really are not made for reading in long stretches. Not at least the iPad 2, which I own. Most of the time is spent in finding the perfect surface for resting the iPad on. Not really a painless experience. Inadvertently, I ended up reading on iPhone more.</p> <h2 id="welcome-kindle">Welcome Kindle</h2> <p>Kindles, the hardware, had just recently launched in India. I knew there were benefits to them. For one, they were made with reading as sole purpose. So they were designed to be best fit by size and weight. I had heard <a href="http://sixcolors.com/post/2014/11/kindle-voyage-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">so</a> <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/10/07/review-79-kindle-with-ads-and-buttons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many</a> <a href="http://hannah-thompson.blogspot.in/2012/04/how-my-kindle-changed-my-life.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stories</a> of how it changed people’s reading habits, made them read more. I <em>knew</em> I wanted one. A bit of research, a bit of playing around with them. I <em>decided</em> I wanted one. For reasons of mine (which I would go into someday), I settled on the <a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B007HCFU90/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3626&creative=24822&creativeASIN=B007HCFU90&linkCode=as2&tag=amitgawande-21&linkId=HMDQIS6SAB7GUNPS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kindle, 6″ E Ink Display (Prev. Generation)</a> with page turning keys, the non-touch screen one.</p> <p>And the reading experience has never been the same again. I am reading more, I am reading longer. Surprisingly, it has made my wife too into an avid reader. A person who rarely considered reading as her hobby, she spends good amount of time finding and reading books. Paperbacks, ones with real pages, could never do that. eBooks did, especially Kindle.</p> <hr /> <p>So coming back to a paperback, it did turn out to be a painful experience. Holding the book was troublesome. Bookmarking was troublesome. Turning pages was troublesome. Wanting to read the book at office was worthless. At one point, I wanted to stop reading it in between, buy an ebook version and continue. The nostalgia, <em>induced by the scent of real pages</em>, can only take you so far. eBooks, for me, have ruined the pleasure of the physical books. Kindle has owned me now; and I can never go back.</p>

			 <h2 id="dark-psycho-thriller-with-neither-mystery-nor-thrill.">Dark, Psycho Thriller with neither Mystery nor Thrill.</h2> <p>I started reading this book wanting, assuming, it to be a suspenseful thriller. I was unaware it is more of a <em>sociopathic, twisted whine-fest</em>. Some can call it a character study, narrative of flawed minds. For me, though, it is all whining. Sick. Sorry!</p> <p>First. You get thrilled only when you long for some character, root for the happenings surrounding their lives. <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21480930.Gone_Girl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gone Girl</a> presented none too me. None of the protagonists, neither Nick nor Amy, interested me. They are too twisted for me to care for them. There was a time I wanted them to just get rid of one another.</p> <p>Second. Plot progresses at unbearable pace. Not slow. <em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Unbearable&#x201D;</em>. It is either stagnant when author is flaunting her literary chops, narrating<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>character study&#x201D;. Or it progresses to next sub-plot or twist way too conveniently. Nothing is believable here. I could not connect to, sympathise with or even imagine any of the events. Slow, lazy unwinding, I don&#x2019;t mind. This broken, staggered recital I have problem with.</p> <p>And then there is the crazy middle and end. <em><strong>[spoiler]</strong> When you make me read ~250 pages of whining, only half way into the book, you better not tell me it was all setup. Nothing you read is true.<strong>[/spoiler]</strong></em> The end is dragged so much that I was just turning pages to make sure it ends. I just didn&#x2019;t care how. There is no buildup, there is no climax. It just ends abruptly. Not left open, but left carelessly unresolved.</p> <p>Sigh. Anyway one can say I should not have read this after all, it is not for me. This dissection of human psyche, especially the twisted one, is not to my taste. All I recall is I have never kept looking at the percentage-read mark so profusely ever. And that&#x2019;s where Gone Girl failed me.</p> <p><strong>My rating:</strong> 2 of 5 stars</p>

			 <p>So, I finally watched Interstellar yesterday; after days of, literally, closing ears and eyes on every mention and reference of this word. It is difficult, not to know anything you usually want to know first-hand about. No one else to blame though; I should not leave the decision of ruining a movie or a book to others. That call should stay only with me after experiencing it. This post is about my experience of watching the movie I waited so long for.</p> <p>Experience, yes. About the movie, no. There are too many intelligent posts already written about it. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/27/7077877/interstellar-film-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reviewing it</a>, <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/interstellar-20141105" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explaining it</a>. <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/interstellar-20141105" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The plot</a>, <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2014/11/28/parsing-the-science-of-interstellar-with-physicist-kip-thorne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the science</a>, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/interstellar_2014/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everything</a>. This is not a post where I intend to do any of that. This is post where I intend to jot down my thoughts of going through an extravagant experience like Interstellar in India. I want to do this especially given I was watching a movie after a break of more than a year &amp; half. I wanted to see how technical advances have improved, if so, the overall movie going experience.</p> <hr /> <p>So here it goes.</p> <ol type="1"> <li><p>Experience of booking a movie has improved since I last did it. Apps have improved a lot. I was pleasantly surprised when the app supported adding the movie ticket to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passbook_(application)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Passbook</a> as an event entry pass. Nice effect and effort of customizing the app to the platform it runs on. Surprisingly, and sadly, not many try to do that.</p></li> <li><p>But using the said pass at the movie theatres is still not possible. I searched for the machine or the person to whom I could flash the pass and enter without a physical ticket. Not possible yet, at least not at all the movie theatres. You still have to collect a physical ticket, show it to a person <em>who tears a part of it &amp; hands over what remains as a proof of your approved presence</em>. They do have a machine to collect the tickets though. However <strong>anyone</strong>, with the booking id, can print the ticket without any validation. He, then, can flash it further as a valid entry pass. Plus it&#x2019;s heading read <em><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span>Booked by Internet&#x201D;</em>. Sigh.</p></li> <li><p>Multiplexes continue to ruin the theatre experience in India. The aim to maximize the earnings out of the small retail spaces is punishing the viewers. Each<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Screen&#x201D; has a maximum of 8-10 rows, with each sitting 15-20 folks. <strong>That limited is a Screen</strong>. In such small spaces, we have 3 tiers of <em>convenience</em>, Silver, Gold and Platinum. Like a regular middle class person, I selected the middle-tier. Surprisingly, the distribution is as any corporate evaluates its employees&#x2019; performance. 10% are awesome. 10% suck. All others are regular blokes who are just <em>okiesh</em>. Same was the case here; 1 row of platinum folks and 1 row of silver. <em>In between the 8 rows of fools</em>. Platinum folks sat with their necks held high, <em>not because they paid more</em>. But because they could hardly see what rolled on the screen without doing so. Then I do clearly recall a<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>silver&#x201D; person turning around and laughing at the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>golden&#x201D; dummy sitting behind; pointing at his silliness to have paid more. Sigh.</p></li> <li><p>Because<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Screen&#x201D;, the hall, is so small, the <strong>actual screen itself is made small</strong>. <em>And so very close to the eyes.</em> To be frank, except for the darkness and <em>the silver bloke pointing &amp; laughing at the dummy goldie</em>, this was not that much a different experience than sitting a foot from my <span class="small-caps">LED</span> television at home. Interstellar deserved better. Multiplex are to know that. Sigh.</p></li> <li><p>Every movie is to have an intermission. After all&#xA0;, we believe in giving businesses to many. If there&#x2019;s no intermission, how are the samosa, pop-corn walas to get their earnings? So a movie is abruptly stopped. Usually I feel every Hollywood movie-maker is aware of this fact; so I could find a logical break being put in every movie. But I think the person who is handed this responsibility uses it to break <em>when he has to pee the most</em>. Be it, then, at the most inopportune place, in middle of some secret revealing dialog. Who cares; <em>he has pee to handle</em>.</p></li> <li><p>People still chatter during the movie. That is after they have settled into their chairs after arriving late. Especially when in a group during a Hollywood flick. More so if the said group is all guys surrounded by another group of girls. Some smarty has to show off his knowledge or crack a foolish, unrelated joke. Happens.Every.Single.Time. I literally watched half the movie with my left ear closed to avoid one such Einstein explaining every single scene that unfolded on the screen.</p></li> <li><p>And then the<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&#x2018;</span>usualities&#x2019;. National anthem is still played, with half standing in respect and others poking there noses around. Head-shadows of late comers are still seen. Mobiles are still not on silent mode. Samosas and pop-corns are still money-wise costly and taste-wise cheap. Torch-bearers still enlighten the lost and side-tracked, searching for the seats. Sigh!</p></li> </ol> <hr /> <p>Anyway, Interstellar was a great movie; it deserves a better treatment than is accorded. Wish I had chosen a single screen theatre, booked a balcony ticket after standing hours in queue and experienced this marvel on a huge screen listening only to the whistle, and not chatter. Or else simply stayed home, catching it on my <span class="small-caps">LED</span> television. A foot away. Sigh!</p>

			 <p>Agatha Christie, a name I saw at every bookstore and avoided every single time.

Everything is perfect, to-the-point; all about the main story and the characters involved. Chapters after chapters, new plot twists are revealed. The story never stagnates. No character eats up the pages. No sub-plots are introduced <em>just to thicken the book binds</em>.</p> <p>But most importantly, <strong>there is no single person that knows-all-but-shows-none</strong>. Incidents occur and they are presented with all the details visible to the characters involved. Nothing is hidden, made visible only to the selected one, the detective. Because there is none.</p> <p>The experience reading this gem is amazing. I pride myself to foresee the final mystery way bit early than it actually is uncovered; or even hinted at. This one bowled me over. Almost all the 10 characters were on my criminal radar at some point. None stayed there for significant time though. Even post the final chapter, I stayed stumped, wondering what has been uncovered.

			 <p>The novel is an entertaining read overall. Expected given that <em>it is penned by an experienced story weaver.</em> But then it also has those parts that make the experience average, at times.</p> <p>It starts out promisingly, Strike interested me. So did Robin (sigh!) and their case at hand. Mystery is woven, with the prose heavily studded in the initial part. Studded it felt, given I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It made me know the characters, though very few, more.The main characters and the plot are built perfectly at about a forth into the book. And then it gets stuck.</p> <p>The mystery that was revealed stays the same; neither does it become more intriguing nor clearer. Lots and lots of characters get introduced, but hardly any new information is unravelled. It was during this time when the prose, that I had initially relished, became a hinderance to my enjoyment. <strong>Especially ones that broke the flow of conversation.</strong> So unnecessary they felt, so much so that I skipped some paragraphs.</p> <p>The plot does pick up towards the final third of the book. Unnecessary prose continue. But this is also when the book becomes unputdownable. So much is revealed, in such intriguing a way. And the plot stays interesting till the end. The climax, unlike so many mystery novels, doesn&#x2019;t feel dragged. The mystery is unravelled in satisfactory a way; <em>a way I do not usually cherish however.</em></p> <p>Yes, I do not cherish the style of suspense novels when we do not have the access to the detective&#x2019;s thoughts. Style where the key information, or the interpretations, are hidden from the reader only to be revealed at the end. The Cuckoo&#x2019;s Calling presents Strike this way. Satisfactory, but not preferred.</p> <p>And that&#x2019;s where the novel lets me down, unnecessary prose, non-preferred style of revealing suspense and too slow a mid-third. Overall, though, for the way the plot &amp; the characters are introduced and the case closed, this is a one-time read for sure.</p> <p><strong>My rating:</strong> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1063694455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 of 5 stars</a></p>

<p>Ever since I decided to own and host my site, i.e. basically ever since this place has existed, I was planning to write down my reasons and choices for the engines that run this site. Couple of feedbacks finally made me jot down the thoughts<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/http://www.amitgawande.com/page/4/#"></a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One thing I was sure about was I did not want to not control any of the knobs of my blog. So I had to go all in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Own the domain first</li><li>Run and customise the blogging engine</li><li>Host the engine</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="domain">Domain</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Deciding on domain name was simpler part; that is once I had given up on all the crazy <em>pseudo-names</em> I wished my blog would have. So I went ahead with my real name. Simple.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To register a domain, there were a lot of options out there. Some were way cheaper but were sucky and known to follow shady-practises. Then there few that were comparatively costly, but simple.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had heard so much about one such simple, no-nonsense domain registration service, <a href="https://hover.com/Dpb5EhLf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hover</a>. Few visits to Hover and I decided Hover was the one that fit my <em>high-horse</em> attitude the most. I usually tend to support the service providers with principles. And it always comes at a cost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So I registered my domain via Hover. The experience was simple and positively uncluttered. I recommend the service. Give it a go. You will be impressed.</p>

<h2 id="bloggingengine">Blogging engine</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have been blogging for quite some time now and have owned the free blogs at Wordpress.com, blogger, tumblr and even posterous. I even hosted a blog with Wordpress.org. Each had their own benefits and shortcomings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Posterous was simple. But it was way too simple.</li><li>Blogger allows heavy customisation, and even monetization via Google AdWords. But it is way too childish. It does not have a professional, or a <em>'mature'</em> look to it.</li><li>Tumblr has nice social sharing features. But that is what it is. It is more of a social network for bloggers rather than a blogging engine. Plus majority of the themes are not good for text heavy posts, which mine always are. It's perfect for images, especially gifs.</li><li>Wordpress.com/.org is the biggie in the space. It has everything possible under the sun. Customisation, extensibility, theming. But it is way too heavy. And far too common. I never like <em>common</em>.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So I was on a look-out for an option that is simple, lite &amp; powerful and gives me a lot of control with what I can do. Enter <a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ghost is a simple open source blogging platform that you can completely own. It provides simple writing tools. I have already detailed what I like about Ghost in the <a href="http://amitgawande.com/heres-to-another-start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first post here</a>. Even the community has accepted it, so there are a lot of customisation options available too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plus if you like coding even a bit, there is nothing better. I had my Ghost blog running on my local machine and I was satisfied, only after some customisation i.e. I adopted and adapted the <a href="https://github.com/sethlilly/Vapor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vapor theme</a> from <a href="http://sethlilly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seth Lilly</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All that remained was to make it available on the internet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Final call I had to make was about how to host the blog I had running on my local machine. One thing I did not want to do was go with a PaaS solution; basically the solutions that provide you just the platform where you can upload the blog and you are up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a way, Ghost made my decision to go against PaaS easier. There are hardly such services that support node.js, javascript based platform, on which Ghost is built.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had decided to either go all in, i.e. get a virtual server (VPS) or simply not worry about hosting myself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ghost allows you both the options. You can either go <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pro</a> with Ghost and let the team handle the hosting for you, like wordpress.com. Second options is to go free and host it yourself. I knew I wanted to go with the second option. And I did.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For getting VPS, I just had two options shortlisted, <a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> or <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Ocean</a>. Linode was costlier. A more pro-dev friendly. Not something I was ready to sign up for with such simple requirements as mine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand I had earlier experience, mostly positive, with Digital Ocean. Plus it had <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-ghost-application" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost application pre-built</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So it was really as simple as creating a droplet and I had my blog up. Finally, I also wanted to secure up the Linux node, and an amazing <a href="http://feross.org/how-to-setup-your-linode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> from Feross Aboukhadijeh got me rolling. It is written for a Linode node; but it can very well work for any Linux server out there. Do not forget to follow these steps. They are must if you are to keep the node running even for short time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So a day in and I had a secure Linux VPS node running my blog which was completely customised by me, as per my needs. And it was satisfactory experience and a fruitful journey.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One way to think of writing is to jot down <em>abundance of words</em>, leading towards a story or an account. Another way is to simply think of it as <em>a medium to express oneself</em>. Every person often comes across such occasions to put his thought, his ideas, his expressions in words. Occasions are aplenty. Event in his own life. Event in the lives of acquaintances, friends or near &amp; dear ones. Or just a public event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of my friends had a similar occasion, <em>one close to his heart</em>. It was anniversary of his engagement with his fiancé, their's 1st. He took all the pains to decide on the gift, the place to buy it from, flowers to go with it and the time they to be delivered at.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then he did what I see people doing most often these days. He went to google and typed “1st anniversary wishes/messages”. I wondered why did he not simply scribble what he felt?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s saddening to see people resist the efforts to pen the words they think of. They go after what others have written, beautifully never-the-less, but at the cost of it being not real, fake. They underestimate the power of conveying ones own feelings in whichever way possible. The words, their structure won’t matter much then. And that is one way one can start writing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1 id="startshortsimpleandpersonal">Start short, simple and personal.</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To start with, don’t miss a chance to write to your loved ones, breed <strong>a will</strong> to do so. Wish them for their successes/failures. Appreciate their kind acts. Console them for what they have lost. Keep it simple, write the words you feel. Take effort to make it personal. Involving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next go for <strong>an outline</strong> that you feel would be more effective. Decide what is the best way to put your thoughts through. Try and improvise on different ways you could communicate. Do you want to narrate an incident you people were involved in? Do you want to glance with them at the journey you had together? Do you want to reflect upon their qualities, good or bad? Or do you simply want to tell them what they mean to you? Think how best you can convey what you want to convey.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And you would be surprised to see the effect that has; on both the reader and you as writer. Don’t act amazed if you want to open up, to express yourself more. Have <strong>belief in yourself</strong> and try to write more. Do so even on more public forums, about public issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Only difference is, in public, the reader might not be the one you can personally connect to. Write for yourself first. Write what you would like reading, something that will please you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So if there is one person, <em>you</em>, who you could please with what you wrote, chances are there will be few more. There will always be a group of readers with whom the thoughts you feel would connect. Adornment of affulent words is no longer a need then.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>

<p>It is raining outside, a steady fall of cheerful drops. I look outside, while am gathering my thoughts, again. Rains always make me do that. Especially such.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cheerful the droplets sound, together. This sound beat is no less than a pleasant sufi composition to my ears. It always cheers me up. It is doing the same to me now too. It's affecting the plans I have for the evening. But I do not feel saddened. Plans can be remade. Such rains are rare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I adore such rains that have a knack of showmanship. They lead with a thorough built-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elaborate gathering of the hazy clouds in the sky. Gradual darkening of the surroundings. Disjointed, but equally systematic, flashes of lightenings filling the skies. Followed so aptly by a symphony of angered rumbles. Unhurried arrival of tiny droplets. And the final showdown with the downpour. Show doesn't end. Post-climactic spans of the gleeful nature leaves one mesmerised.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today's is one such showman. It, indeed, has left me mesmerised. Rejuvenated!</p>

			 <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I like listening to podcasts<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/http://www.amitgawande.com/page/4/#"></a> and have been regularly doing so. Podcasts have almost become my go-to source of entertainment during my commutes or non-working lone times. If I can focus on what's playing, I listen to podcasts. Music is only for the times when I don't want people to disturb me and concentrate, mostly during work<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/http://www.amitgawande.com/page/4/#"></a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's no surprise, then, that the podcast-listening applications, or <em>podcatchers</em>, are few of the most used, and so most important, apps on my phone. And because I interact with these apps very frequently throughout the day, I look for a frictionless experience while using them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/http://marco.org/">Marco Arment</a> launched <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/http://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a> I was highly excited. I was waiting for this app since he first <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/http://www.marco.org/2013/09/23/overcast-coming-soon">wrote</a> about it. I knew Marco would have a different take on how we consume podcasts. I had high expectations while I downloaded the app.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Overcast did deliver. Almost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="perfectexceptwhiledownloading">Perfect, except while downloading</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overcast gives a different spin to almost every aspect of the podcast listening experience. Just the first impression promoted the app to my home screen, even my dock. There were so many things that impressed me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall look, user interface and experience of the app has a refreshing feel to it; even the colours and fonts used are easy on eyes. Playlists management and playback controls are simple and intuitive, equally powerful at the same time. Voice boost does assist in making podcasts more audible in a car/bus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smart-speed, the <em>silence killer</em>, is brilliant. It's just been 20 days since I started using this app and this feature has already saved an extra 3 hours on my podcast listening time. This feature alone is sufficient enough to make Overcast my default app. It even did for 2 weeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However this <em>smart</em> feature was clouded by <strong>the data-unfriendly behaviour of the app while downloading episodes.</strong> And this was a huge minus for the app.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I feel most of the shortcomings during downloads are due to the misguided assumption on Marco's part; that a user either wants every episode from a podcast automatically downloaded or wants none. The belief, it seems, is one would never decide whether to download an episode, manually, only when it arrives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, that is not true for all. Some of us do like to be notified when an episode of our favourite podcast is released, read what would be discussed and then decide whether to download it or not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overcast struggles to do either of it.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can either "Subscribe to All New Episodes" of a podcast and be notified/not notified when a new episode is released or just disable the subscribe option. There is no way to just be notified, but not download the episode.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reading about an episode is not easy too. I assumed initially, and accidentally do so even now, that clicking on the episode should expand its description. Rather it starts downloading it. I have to target the <em>(i)</em> and click it to read the description. Not friendly, really.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:image {"align":"left","id":6347,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2020/8a2a2168c7.jpg" alt="Overcast" class="wp-image-6347"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even when the download begins, the options visible to take actions are not really intuitive. First of all, there is no information on the data size of the episode. It is especially important to display this information when one has to decide whether to download it over the data connection or not<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/http://www.amitgawande.com/page/4/#"></a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway once the download begins, the button changes to something with a pause symbol in it. First of all, as can be seen, the ring around the pause button is no indication of the download status.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Secondly, the pause button does not actually pause the download. It stops it, discarding the already downloaded data and begins re-download from 0% on 'resume'. I understand the limitation that Core Audio puts while storing partially downloaded files, but least I expect is not to show a pause button at all if it does not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All these issues with download manager really make it difficult for me to use Overcast. Marco does say he builds apps which cater to him first and solves the problem he faces. So he, may be, did not foresee the way the podcasts are actually consumed, especially in non-first world countries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He, also, may say that Overcast is not for me and I should try the other <em>independent</em> apps he, so earnestly, showcases in the settings menu.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However I really like Overcast's episode management and playback features and would want to use them. I would miss them in the other apps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But as long as the app does not value the importance of data, I am afraid it will stay in my backup folder, <em>waiting for the appropriate update</em>.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2014/08/13/105900.html">The Conscious Subconscious</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2014/08/13/105900.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2014-08-13 10:59:00 &#43;0530">Aug 13, 2014</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One's subconscious wakes up pretty frequently, at times during events not that significant in grand scheme of things. This was one such incident.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was raining outside. I was, however, in a rush to come out of the building. I had already gotten late to leave my desk. Not that I had a bus to catch; rather I had buses to miss. I had to hit the road before the swarm of office shuttles poured on to the roads. That was my best, may be <em>the only</em>, chance to reach home unflustered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was trotting along the road, with my mind preoccupied with the thought to reach the parking lot sooner. Shall I take a straight route to the parking lot with just a turn or one with many arcs and twists? I had already started hustling on the straight route.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I, then, felt an itch on my <em>left</em> hand, just beneath the watch I was wearing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I removed the watch and held it. I was lost for a moment, looking for a replacement place for the watch to reside. I realised I could wear it on my right wrist too and I went ahead to strap it there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But my subconscious mind, fast asleep till then, woke up making me aware about what I was doing. That is when it dawned on me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I never wear a watch on my right hand. Never.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The incident got me thinking why was it so? Why was it that strapping a watch on the right hand was such a taboo for me? When did I decide it should always be on the left hand? I looked around me, none of the people had the watch on their right hand. None. No one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could come up with some quick answers as to why that might be the case. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/http://www.amitgawande.com/page/4/#"></a> But I was not after a particular, <em>rational</em>, answer. I was curious about the <em>pre-programmed</em> behaviour of mine that makes me do, without much thinking, many of the chores I regularly do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I knew there would be a lot of such <em>wired</em> decisions I keep making, and I went on to identify some of those. It didn't take much time for me to compile the list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>I prefer even numbers, for any and every thing. Counting, stop-watch, timer, alarm, volume rocker. Every number settles on an even number.</li><li>I hate characters, <em>in alphabet</em>, with pointy triangles in them. V, N, Z. I hate them.</li><li>I prefer path which is straight, with lesser turns, even if longer. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/http://www.amitgawande.com/page/4/#"></a></li><li>I pick a pen up when I want to note down something closer to my heart, for reasons I <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/http://amitgawande.com/pen-is-still-mightier/">wrote about earlier</a>.</li><li>And many more..</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The alternatives just don't feel right to me. Rather I do not even think about or look out for the alternative.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I might assign reasons, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150412224034/http://www.livescience.com/23902-brains-unconscious-bias-decisions.html"><em>possibly scientific too</em></a>, to each one of them. But I would go back to doing the things, liking them or hating them, just the way I am programmed to do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And I feel every one of us, if he or she decides, could come up with one such list. All we need to do is keep our mind open and question.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One might wonder what would he/she gain from the exercise? Well, it is good to know the <em>always-awake</em>, the conscious, subconscious is looking over, making small decisions for you, always.</p>

			 <p>Recently I read an article by Nick Bilton that announced, or at least inclined to, the demise of the pen. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/24/fashion/the-demise-of-the-pen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>Fare Thee Well, My Pen&#x201D;</a>, the headline read.</p> <p>It claimed<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span>the pen is <em>murdered</em> by finger&#x201D;. It claimed today&#x2019;s technology driven world rarely gives us an opportunity, or rather rarely necessitates us, to use a pen. It claimed we use fingers on touch screens/keyboards, a <a href="http://phys.org/news/2013-06-digital-tablets-classroom.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proven superior alternative</a> by few, to perform most of the jobs.</p> <p>In the end, it made me wonder if that really is true. Do I observe this around me? Answer came, may be. After all, I rarely see a pen these days. May be that is for the reasons that Nick Bilton so succinctly puts forth.</p> <p>Shall we all, then, decree the pen as dead? Shall we, then, assume this old device as obsolete? Well, may be not so soon.</p> <p>I feel pen will live on; the form, though, might be unlike what is seen today.</p> <h2 id="handwritten-words-reflect-writers-personality">Handwritten words reflect writer&#x2019;s personality</h2> <p>In my list of<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&#x2018;</span>read-later&#x2019; articles lied another post from Matt Gemmell,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&#x201C;</span><a href="http://mattgemmell.com/handwriting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Handwriting</a><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">&#x201D;</span>. Here&#x2019;s what Matt has to say about decreased usage of hand-written words (emphasis mine).</p> <blockquote> <p>We&#x2019;ve lost something. Our instantly-delivered, electronically rendered thoughts are clean and readable, but if we&#x2019;re honest, they also inhabit a sort of uncanny valley. There&#x2019;s a degree of removal between the work and the author. Perfect letterforms, <em>lined up algorithmically, standing like an eerie, emotionless army of sinister mannequins.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>I really could not have put the thoughts any better. Unnecessary to say then, I completely agree with Matt.</p> <p>Words penned on a piece of paper, by hand, have a personality of their own. Usually it is the reflection of the writer&#x2019;s personality, even his current state of mind.</p> <p>Words strung together via key-presses, on the other hand, all look the same. Does not matter, then, if they were carefully studded by a gleeful lover or were hurriedly spread across by a tear-ridden son. They all look exactly the same.</p> <h2 id="a-passing-phase">A Passing phase</h2> <p>Intermittent solution technologists have, currently, is fonts. Every user is supposed to select a font while putting words through. Designers try to design fonts that look pleasant, have different strokes, and heights, and distribution of weight in characters. What we are supposed to believe is we select fonts based on who we are. What we are supposed to believe is we impart personality to what we write when we select fonts.</p> <p>We are fooled, I believe.</p> <p>I believe this is just a passing phase when fonts represent what designers want them to. Designers, hence, craft fonts that make words look the best. Least thought is given to make them look authentically personal.</p> <p>I believe the day is not far when technology will allow every person to trace his own font in simplest of manner. That day the words from different people would not be the same. That day even the words digitally rendered would exhibit authenticness, a uniqueness. That day the reader will infer the mood of the writer from his email.</p> <p>Pen, in its current form, may not be saved then (and that battle is already lost, I believe). But the individuality and the personality will prevail in the words penned via its remodelled form too.</p> <p>Only then, will this beloved ink-filled canister rest in peace!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This site is a result of in-numerous attempts at pushing myself to own my blog, <em>again</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/journey-to-a-self-hosted-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last attempt</a> was significant for me because it allowed me to fully host and own a wordpress blog. It had a good run through my bachelor life, got neglected later and finally shuttered, post marriage. Posts still reside, though, at a wordpress.com blog, which, deep inside I knew, was nothing but a placeholder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So my wait continued for the inspiration that would push me to create and own, again, a simpler place for my thoughts. And that inspiration came from <a href="https://github.com/cliss/camel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Camel</a>, the blogging engine from <a href="http://www.caseyliss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casey Liss</a> of <a href="http://www.atp.fm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atp</a> fame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The inspiration, though, was not because I liked Camel, <em>which even now I haven't made my mind about</em>. But it was because I wanted to have something as simple as what Casey had, and get that done in an equally simpler way. At the same time, I also wanted to learn and try something new.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I knew my requirements were not complex, neither did I expect my audience to be huge. So I needed something simpler than a full fledged, php-rich, wordpress blog hosted on a dedicated host, which I also realised is <strong>too costly</strong> for my needs. Enter <a href="http://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="newbeginning">New Beginning</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So this is where my quest led me to, a simple Ghost based blog to jot my thoughts down. The reasons, I had my own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Simple</strong> I had heard so much about <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> before. I felt everybody, almost everyone who writes for himself, was using Markdown. And every one of them had all the nice things to say about it. Even I tried learning it numerous times. <em>But, I realised now that it is only when you use it that you appreciate the simplicity of it.</em> It really makes writing, just about writing. Something I really needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>New</strong> I wanted to change everything, the way I write my posts, the way it looks, the way it works and the way I would host. I was bored of all that wordpress or even tumblr, something I <a href="http://amitgawande.tumblr.com/">played with</a> for sometime, provided. It all felt the same. For some time, I even thought about just using Camel. But then I would have had to work even on the engine along with writing, which I didn't want to sign up for just yet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Not costly</strong> For hosting, I wanted to meet the above 2 points first, at the same time consider the cost factor. A free option existed with <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroko</a> as suggested by <a href="http://www.caseyliss.com/2014/5/1/heroku-first-impressions">Casey</a> and <a href="http://www.therightcode.net/deploy-ghost-to-heroku-for-free/">Greg Bergé</a>. However, I either wanted to go all in, with <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-ghost-application" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosting on VPS</a> or just stick to the <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simplest option</a> from the creators of Ghost. Anything I chose, would have turned out to be a lot cheaper than what I paid for hosting the unnecessarily complex wordpress blog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What I, <em>thus</em>, have is a simple, minimalist place for me to just write. I own, again, a self-built, self-hosted blog. Here's to another start!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>[Postscript]</strong> There would a temporary phase when I focus more on the <strong><em>place</em></strong> than on <strong><em>writing</em></strong>. However, I intend to cross that phase pretty soon. Whatever that results in, I feel, should, more or less, look pretty similar to this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>[Postscript 2]</strong> I <a href="http://amitgawande.com/blog-with-ghost-and-digital-ocean" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have writen a followup post</a> that explains the <em>why</em>s and <em>how-to</em>s of this complete process.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Another introduction where I am involved, as in I listen, happened today. These introductions haunt me, always. Names are exchanged and so is the purpose for visit and some pleasantries. We talk, we laugh, we share. Then the meeting, or the visit, ends. Everything is well and good. That is until we meet the next time. The other person smiles, starts talking. And all I am thinking, of course with a smile on my face, is what the bloody hell is your name again!? As it turns out, the last time we met, it was the name part that I conveniently side-stepped while registering the introduction in memory.</p>
<p>And this occurs with me way too often. Initial interaction happens with the introduction, then I forget the name. At first I just don&rsquo;t take the trouble to know the name thinking may be we just won&rsquo;t meet that often after all.  But the interaction continues. It increases often; we meet more. We talk more. We become acquaintances. We are on the verge of becoming friends. And all I am still thinking of is how the hell should I get this person mouth his name again. Asking for name is absolutely not an option now because I am already in a friend or a known person zone. The bridge has been crossed. So all I do is wait for him or some one else speak the said person&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>And I do realize this is a very assholistic behavior on my part. So this time I decide this behavior of mine has to end. And I <a title="Bing Search Query" href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=remembering+names" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">query the web</a>. You know what, this is way too common a phenomenon. So common that there are zillions of &ldquo;n ways to remember names&rdquo; self-helf articles across the web. Ways suggested stretch from plain childish to utter foolish.</p>
<p>For example, break the name into parts and remember the parts. Yeah.. a fool-proof way. Only if I could remember to break the name first and remember the parts next. Or associate the name with something. So if you are <em>Ramesh</em>, I will remember you as <em>mesh</em>. What bull crap. How awkward would it be to think of the made association every time you meet, say <em>Vikas or Hardik.</em> Nope. Not gonna work. Or make the name dance in front of eyes. Or what not. Complete non-sense.</p>
<p>Only thing that made sense to me was to speak the name out aloud. More times, the better. Well that is one thing I can do. That is one thing I am going to do rather. So next time you meet me and introduce yourself, please bear with me if I go on chanting your name in every statement that follows. And so will I if I see you doing the same.</p>

Going in to the chapter 1 of Inferno, I didn&rsquo;t have too high expectations. I was looking for a breezy page-turner with some anecdotes on sculptures, people, places intermingled with the story. However I was disappointed to see Dan Brown fail to deliver even that.</p>
<p>Anecdotes are way too many and completely irrelevant to the story. Many a times, the novel reads as Brown&rsquo;s travelogue of places during his research, just there to increase the page count. I remember ignoring many paragraphs describing some sculpture or a building or a painting. Uninteresting. Plain boring. Do research Mr. Brown; just don&rsquo;t force everything into a novel.</p>
<p>And there are so many discernible and ludicrous attempts at being relevant to the current tech-aware audience. All the references to iPads, iPhones, ebooks etc. fall flat, cringeworthy.</p>
<p>Finally to the story, what is expected is a mystery to be solved by Professor Langdon through the clues sprinkled in historic symbols. I feel the novel fails there too. Codes and clues are way too simple, straight-forward. Many don&rsquo;t even lead something significant; they are just there to bring Langdon in picture. Inferno could well have been a sci-fi mystery novel instead of a Robert Langdon one. Disappointed.</p>
<p>My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/644631174">2 of 5 stars</a></p>

<p>My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/676599960">4 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>First two chapters down and I knew am in for an epic saga. The book had me right from the stories of the two protagonists being christened.</p>
<p>This was one of the finest examples of how the characters are built. Every single one, even the supporting ones, was well shaped. With that done in the backdrop of the historical events, they felt real. To see how each one of the events impacted the characters had a smile on my face. I was emotionally with them in their rise to success, rooting for one at times, while the other at others. Their stories might feel cliched, but I felt them. And then they met, right around the middle.</p>
<p>I felt the second half was a bit weak. The events became forced every time the characters had to meet. Kane and Abel, as individuals, had me intrigued. But Kane and Abel together? Not much. The rivalry felt contrived, childish. Agreed, I was interested to know what unfolded next. But it played out just the way I predicted. Interested, and then disappointed not to be proved wrong.</p>
<p>And I have to mention that the romantic parts were the weakest. Such lifeless, boring mentions of jumbled adult words. There for just no reason. Good they didn&rsquo;t last long, I cringed every time.</p>
<p>Having said all, I did enjoy the novel, an entertaining read. It had me interested in Kane and Abel till the end. And that&rsquo;s where it succeeded.</p>

			 <p>We, the humans, are a race of thinkers. We are pampered while growing up, someone always making the decisions for us. Proving the point from time to time that the decisions they made for us were correct, were for our greater good.</p>
<p>We are deterred from erring. We are convinced that erring is bad. We are asked to make sure we think through what we are doing. We are told that erring can be, should be, avoided by thinking. We end up not erring much. But we end up not doing much. We end up thinking, and thinking again and then again.</p>
<p>In relationship. Do I like her? Does she like me? Will my friends like her? Do I really like her? Will my family accept her? Am I rushing? Am I not going too slow?</p>
<p>While shopping. Do I like this? Does this suit me? Is it better than what my neighbor has? Is it too costly? Does it look too cheap?</p>
<p>At home. At work. While driving. While sleeping. While eating. While breathing, even.</p>
<p>We think. We analyze. We halt. Paralyzed.</p>
<p>Analysis Paralysis. That’s what science people call it.</p>
<p>Paralysis, of any part, drives the part unmoving, static. A complete loss of feeling. This paralysis drives complete ‘you’ unmoving, static.</p>
<p>So next time you are faced with such situation where you cannot make a decision, think about what worse can happen if you decide and err. You will be surprised to realize that majority of the cases work out not affecting you much.</p>
<p>Think, decide and do. Don’t overthink, give-up and halt.</p>

			 <p>Another rainfall, another stroll to the cafeteria, another shot of similar feelings. Just couldn’t help but dig out this old post and repost.</p>
<p>Speechless …. That’s how today’s incident caught me. Really felt am i missing something? Am i really enjoying my life? Corporate world has indeed made me dry. Juiceless. Deprived of whatever fun element I had in my life. Saw the wet earth today and there loomed the childhood days in front of me.</p>
<p>Those hours I spent sitting on a sofa employing my eyes out at rain beaten roads. “Chai-Bhajji” or “Pohe” that i relished. Slightest sound of a rain drop that made me run towards the porch. Spellbound eyes of mine that tried to gulp up a sight of lush green fields. An enchanting effect that even a midget breeze created. The restlessness that a sight of river or even a small stream gave me. The dew-laden grass plates that endorsed the mesmerizing capacity of the nature. “Aai” who always dabbed me forcefully in the sweater and monkey-cap. Soothing effect that the cooler-chilled room created after returning from burning heat. Glasses of Rasna i gobbled. Waits for the “Chachaji-Sabu-Raka” Combo. Exchanges of comics and greedily moving through the pages, just to make sure we read the most. Carrom Games, Cards, Cricket matches that we played, ignorant of screeching sun, blowing winter or pouring rains. Dirty clothes that i washed so as to keep “aai” unaware of mud-ridden football matches. And the list just goes on, endless. I never knew what really allured me so strongly. But I do was.</p>
<div></div>
<p>And today, here I am looking at the rain-hit porch from my AC cubical. Without a sofa, “Pohe”or “Chai Bhajji”. Drops kept pouring, waiting for me to run into the porch. Lush-green lawn’s spread out there, just to make me spellbound again. Gone are the rivers/streams and am in the middle of bulk of fountains. But these don’t make me restless. “Aai Daddy” are there, always at the other end of phone line. Mirinda can’t take the place rasna holds. Dan Brown or Sidney Sheldon can’t surrogate “Raj or Diamond”. “Batman-Superman” can easily be kneeled down by “Druv-Nagraj”. Gone are the games. Gone are the friends. Gone are the fun-filled days. Nature’s still out there. Calling me. Waiting to mesmerize me. With me completely oblivious.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Thanks a lot, corporate world. Thanks a lot!!!</p>

			 <blockquote>Some years ago, executives at a Houston airport faced a troubling customer-relations issue. Passengers were lodging an inordinate number of complaints about the long waits at baggage claim. In response, the executives increased the number of baggage handlers working that shift. The plan worked: the average wait fell to eight minutes, well within industry benchmarks. But the complaints persisted.
<p>Puzzled, the airport executives undertook a more careful, on-site analysis. They found that it took passengers a minute to walk from their arrival gates to baggage claim and seven more minutes to get their bags. Roughly 88 percent of their time, in other words, was spent standing around waiting for their bags.</p>
<p>So the airport decided on a new approach: instead of reducing wait times, it moved the arrival gates away from the main terminal and routed bags to the outermost carousel. Passengers now had to walk six times longer to get their bags. Complaints dropped to near zero.</blockquote></p>
<p>There is some great theory there. Man I love human tendency to fool oneself into not hating something.</p>

<p>Credit where it is due, Google has to be lauded for encouraging the open research on topics so varied. There is so much potential with computing power and data at Google.</p>

			 <p>… I won’t be surprised if BJP tags this loss as the failure of UPA government. Someone, mostly Gadkari, might go so far to claim that there is a big conspiracy behind the loss. UPA planned and executed the loss just to divert “aam aadmi’s” attention away from the zillions of unearthing scams.</p>
<p>UPA on the other hand will appoint a committee to look into the loss and give out the steps to be followed, “Committee will come up with the report which will go to PAC that will come to parliament where it will be discussed over and, if any irregularities found, will be open for discussion on action to be taken, followed by the actual action to be taken, given it is decided that another committee need not be formed to investigate the report submitted by the first committee.”</p>

<p>BCCI will plan another tour (2 tests, 3 ODIs, 2 T20s) against Zimbabwe accepting their offer to pay the money won through win against Bangladesh in return.</p>
<p>New breed cricketers will continue their wait for IPL and play the international matches as practice sessions for IPL.</p>

			 <p>Interesting read this about an experiment involving <a title="Joshua Bell" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Bell" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua Bell</a>. You feel for him when we says this:</p>
<blockquote>
With &#8220;Chaconne,&#8221; the opening is filled with a building sense of awe.  That kept him busy for a while. Eventually, though, he began to steal a  sidelong glance.
<p>&ldquo;It was a strange feeling, that people were actually, ah …&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word doesn’t come easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;… <em>ignoring</em> me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is even more puzzling though is this thought from Mark Leithauser.</p>
<blockquote>
"Let&#8217;s say I took one of our more abstract masterpieces, say an Ellsworth Kelly, and removed it from its frame, marched it down the 52 steps that people walk up to get to the National Gallery, past the giant columns, and brought it into a restaurant. It&#8217;s a $5 million painting. And it&#8217;s one of those restaurants where there are pieces of original art for sale, by some industrious kids from the Corcoran School, and I hang that Kelly on the wall with a price tag of $150. No one is going to notice it. An art curator might look up and say: &#8216;Hey, that looks a little like an Ellsworth Kelly. Please pass the salt.&#8217;"
</blockquote>
<p>So life-less we have become. Or were we always like this?</p>

			 <p>Change is important. Change is inevitable. But if not, it has to be forced. Change is one thing I plan to undergo every time there is nothing happening around.</p>
<p>Change the way I commute to office. Change the route I use. Change the time I travel. Change the schedule at office. Change the schedule at home. Change the services I use. Change the products I use. I.e. Change everything that’s changeable.</p>
<p>Change something. Change at least one thing. Because that cascades down one’s life to change everything. And this change is important. It freshens one up. It pushes one out of his comfort zone. Rather it just doesn’t allow him to enter a comfort zone; a zone of mechanical activeness.</p>

			 <p>It was second incident in last 2 weeks when I had to select a mobile number for myself. Now this activity may sound simple and non-important. But I always find it an extremely confusing experience.</p>
<br />
<p>Think about it. In front of you are the numbers “available” for you to select as your contact number. Now first thing you have to make sure is the number should be at least easy enough to remember yourself so you do not have to open your contact list every time someone asks for your number.</p>
<br />
<p>Now I always find one which is easy enough to remember myself. But it so happens that the way I say the number is always different from how the person who listens to it utters.</p>
<br />
<p>To elaborate, I speak the number this way 4 2345 85 15. (Spaces are the pauses I take.) So simple right. Now this is how the other person repeats it 423 458 515. I am like what the hell. It takes me few seconds to realise both of them are the same.</p>
<br />
<p>So the aim is to, if possible, select a number which is easy to remember/recognise, whatever way one utters it. And I very rarely find one.</p>
<br />
<p>That’s not all. Lets move back to the initial situation. As I said, in front of you are the numbers “available” for you to select. Available. For you. Only these numbers.</p>
<br />
<p>So basically these are the numbers which no one, who has selected his contact number earlier, found easy enough to remember. And I have to select one from them. I could, till date, never prevent this thought from entering my mind.</p>
<br />
<p>In the end, I always end up selecting some number which neither I, nor someone else could fathom at the same time.</p>
<br />
<p>PS: Just received a compliment of my number being awesomely simple. So mission accomplished the second time.</p>

			 <p>There is one concept in this confusing world which I absolutely hate. Something called “Timezone”. Who, in their right mind, will decide that from today onwards, we will attach a 3 or 4 letter combination at the end of time and make it a hell of an experience to understand what time it exactly is.<br /><br />Think about it. How simple would the life have been if the time was same for everyone, 2am is 2am. Irrespective of whether you are in USA or Germany or Australia or India. But no, some smarty pants didn’t like it simple. And in came the senseless words like PST and EST and AEST and IST and what not.<br /><br />They did not stop at that. They brought something else called “Daylight Saving Time”. I mean haven’t you made the concept ‘time’ itself enough confusing sucker that now you add another two heavy words before that?<br /><br />Look at what it does in Australia. Daylight savings is put in place so that afternoons are brightest and mornings are lesser. They move the time further by an hour. So 5pm AEST is now 6pm AEST. I still can’t accept that there was no sensible guy present who crawled at them shouting dudes you are screwing the evenings.<br /><br />Now it does not get dark till 8pm. Yeah bugger 8pm is the time when you can say it is evening. And as a nice middle class Indian kid I am taught to sleep at 10:00pm. So basically I sleep when the evening has just dawned. Screw you Mr. Daylight Saver.<br /><br />Moreover I never understand why the eff was this philosophy put in place at the first place. Not like it is saving hell lot of light or something. Irrespective of this daylight saving, light will remain the same between dawn and dusk. Why add 1 hour rather than simply calling it a day when there is light, not when it is 5am.<br /><br />Now to the outcome of all these twisted minds. Today when some dumbo mentions just some random time, say 2pm, you have to first query is it his time or yours? Lucky you if he is not a dumbo and says yours. But as I have called him a dumbo, he has to say it is his 2pm.<br /><br />So you have to first think what country he is at. Then think what season/month it is at that place. Then think if it is sunny enough there for introducing daylight savings? Then if it is, find out how many hours you need to add to make sure you know when you need to call him exactly. Thank you, you SOAB.<br /><br />Now don’t be too smart yourself and bring in technologies like google and world clocks and all. Thats not the point.<br /><br />The point is wouldn’t the world be a little less messy and irritating a place to spend lifetime of yours at, had you not have to worry about as simple a question as “what time is it”?<br /><br />PS: I believe there was a reason for bringing all these concepts through. But I also believe there has to be a simpler solution to this worldly problem. I have few thoughts but need to put them in place. Topic for another post soon.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">Yesterday there was a buzz going along in my office. My colleague asked me if I would be interested in parting away $2 of mine to embrace a chance to win 15million. (Yeah you heard it right, that is the amount I was told. million as in 7 .. arrr 6 zeros.)</span></p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">Now I am not those champu &#8220;1$ bole to (translation &#8216;equals&#8217;) 40 rupaya&#8221; kind of guy. But the confidence with which this $2 ke 15 million deal was sold to me made me enquire further. It turns out, my &#8220;hard earned&#8221; money was betted on a lottery ticket.</span></p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">The concept is simple she said. Join a bunch of 10-15 guys and buy a lottery ticket together. One guy gets lucky, everyone gets benefited. Playing safe and sensible she called it.</span></p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">Now I am no economist, but one thing I can tell you for sure is this &#8220;deal&#8221; is not going to work in long run. All it would take is one moderate win to break the group. Lucky guy will part, because he will think he could have won this money by himself. And group will shrink with each and every win.</span></p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">Plus what amazes me is how much lucky a lucky guy would have to be to overcome lucklessness of 9-14 other unlucky suckers!</span></p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">I always feel that an equilibrium can be attained to make sure that a person will never run bankrupt by any sensible spending; investment is the key. I aim to attain this equilibrium, which my current spending habits are making extremely difficult to.</span></p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">I am sure these $2 spent today are as much an expenditure as they are an investment. Atleast as of today.</span></p>

			 <p>Cake was being cut. Everybody stood around the “oh-am-one-more-year-old” guy and all of them were like “cmon-cut-that-cake-now-you-moron”. I stood there hoping that the cursed words do not leave some jackass’ mouth. And they did, against my wish..</p>
<br />
<p>&ldquo;Happy B’day to you… happy b’day to you..&lt;blah blah.. blah blah..&gt;&rdquo;</p>
<br />
<p>Now 80% percent did hum along the first “Happy B’day to you”. The number, however, dropped exponentially after that. The last “Happy B’day to you” was wished just by a single dumbo. Big time embarrassment I tell you.</p>
<br />
<p>See I am not being cynical here. I am equally happy that this person neared his death by one more year. But the problem is no one sings that song with the feelings it was actually meant to have. Plus the guy for whom the song is being sung is equally embarrassed as those who sing that song. So question arises why sing it at all.</p>
<br />
<p>Moreover I always felt whoever sung that song for the first time had something anti-asian boiling in his mind. Why the hell will he compose the third line the way he did then?</p>
<br />
<p>Confused? Well you haven’t sung, on top of your voice, “Happy b’day dear Harmoninderpal or Au or Venkataramana” then. I have and let me tell you, it is very effort taking. Need an indication of how effort taking and difficult it is? Well try and make <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1651315/" target="_blank" title="IMDB: Nisha Kothari" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nisha Kothari</a> act.</p>
<br />
<p>So the point am trying to make is stop singing this song. The melody was picked up from some song sung by two kindergarten school teachers in some late 1800’s and it does not suit this age now. Go read details <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday_to_You" target="_blank" title="Happy Birthday to You" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Stop being moronic and make all the people involved, cake cutters and cake eaters, embarrassed. Birthday celebrations would be lesser pathetic this way.</p>
<br />
<p>PS: This song singing always reminds of the way we used to hum the “maine pyar tumhise kiya hain..” song during antakshari sessions in front of the girls, which were the ‘things’ we used to interact with just during such sessions back then. Embarrassing, way embarrassing!</p>
<br />
<p>PPS: The key to the “since 1912” part in title is in that link I shared for this moronic song’s history. Go grab a bite.</p>

			 <p>Since I arrived in Sydney, this question has been discussed and fought and betted over so many times among we friends. I mean the moment a clearcut-non-firangi girl is spotted, the next question that pops out is “Is she Indian?”.</p>
<br />
<p>The reason is simple. Everyone wants to be on top of his face reading skills. ‘I see them and I identify them’ is what most would want to boast about. No specific take away expected, just a self-satisfaction. And anyone and everyone is ready to bet a coffee or a lunch or a dinner for proving his reign over the so-called skill.</p>
<br />
<p>Now gone are the days when it was assumed that if someone bets, he must be right. So no one agrees with other, rather he too bets along. Thus these bets always end up being unverified “my-word-to-his” bets.</p>
<br />
<p>But that no way reduces the fun in such bets. The theories each side has to defend his view are just innovative, patentable always. Every single aspect, the way she talks, walks, stands, puts on makeup or does hair, is used as basis. You see basics have to be strong every time.</p>
<br />
<p>However today was different. Another such case was spotted and a bet initiated. This time however both were determined to prove he is right. And decided they will go enquire and sort this out once and for all.</p>
<br />
<p>Now imagine a situation, when a couple of guys with a bearded attire, resembling a “just-woke-up-hungry-ready-to-pounce” looks, walk to a simple unknown girl and query “Are you Indian?”. Both have the “I-would-win” hope filled looks in their eyes.</p>
<br />
<p>What can a girl respond in such situation other than a straight “no”. I guess she would negate anything these guys say or ask including “Are you a girl?”. Well that didn’t solve the bet. In came the defence, “The way she said no straight away? She has to be Indian”.</p>
<br />
<p>So for me the bet remained unresolved though I commended their courage to carry this attire with such confidence in front of an unknown unidentified girl. The question still remained, “Is she Indian?”</p>
<br />
<p>PS: Girls from china, japan, taiwan, malaysia etc are out of discussion here. I don’t want to sound any way racist, but I will just say we all <i>name them under one category</i> and move along. They would be having there own internal discussion about their origins the moment they spot one.</p>
<br />
<p>PPS: Such discussions happen even in India when the skill move to a state level, i,e read a face and guess the state.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The beasts called elevators end up pissing me off every single time. I had rambled about these dumb asses earlier <a href="http://www.elatedamit.com/2008/10/nine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Go grab a bite.</p>
<br />
<p>If you have read that post, you will know that the ramblings mentioned earlier were particularly about those ill-chipped lifts of that underdeveloped guest house. But now I am convinced these shameless creatures are programmed to torture their inmates.</p>
<br />
<p>I mean think about it. What are the decisions these lifeless steel rooms have to make.. (<a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/elevator7.htm" target="_blank" title="How Elevators work" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inspiration</a>)</p>
<br />
<ul><br /><li>Where do the people want to go?</li><br /><br /><li>Where they are and where each floor is?</li><br /><br /><li>What strategy they need to make so that they are cursed the least?</li><br /></ul>
<br />
<p>First decision is pretty simple. We make that decision for you, you bugger. You see those glowing numbers on the number pads we keep on pressing one after other? Yeah that is where we want to go. As quick as possible.</p>
<br />
<p>Second decision has a whole lot of mechanics behind it. I mean there are some shafts and then there are some holes on some vertical tapes and then there is some counting involved. I would surely like to go in details, but I don’t want to. So I won’t. Visit that inspiration link you see above.</p>
<br />
<p>However the part that puzzles me the most is the strategy because that’s when these supposed-to-be angels stop being ones and enter the devil’s land. Now these buggers have to strategise where to go, when to go and how to go. And I absolutely feel that they are not wired to do so. I mean how else can you explain the simplest of the things these dudes screw up.</p>
<br />
<p>How many times have you waited for an elevator to scroll right from 50 meters below basement up to the 14th floor when his other buddy is resting right at the 15th floor? Do they have some gentlemen’s agreement where one simply says “Can’t you see sucker I have just finished carrying 6 fat asses up and down thrice between just 2 floors. I am tired now and you can for sure handle these dumbos”.</p>
<br />
<p>How many times have you jailed yourself in a jam packed elevator as it drools itself down the shaft stopping and opening at each floor. If you are outside, those seemingly endless few seconds you spend when you apply all your permutation skills to see if you can possibly fit in any of the available gaps inside before giving up are just killing.</p>
<br />
<p>There are many other plights of these long travels between floors. But you see the point is the where, when and how part has to be strategised properly.</p>
<br />
<p>I will pen down the requirements for you. An elevator, for minimum, has to</p>
<br />
<ul><br /><li>follow quickest path to you and quickest path to where you desire to go.</li><br /><br /><li>open only if it can intake any of the fat asses, close and start the journey as soon as everyone hops on.</li><br /><br /><li>understand when some mischievous fatty calls it, but does not want to hop on.</li><br /><br /><li>not kill my mobile signal.</li><br /><br /><li>close the doors faster so people get less chance to stop the elevator and say the <a href="http://www.elatedamit.com/2009/03/sorry-for-what-dude" target="_blank" title="Sorry, for what .." rel="noopener noreferrer">meaningless &#8220;S&#8221; word</a> again.</li><br /></ul>
<br />
<p>These are just a few suggestions that can make this floor travel not a sucking experience after all.</p>
<br />
<p>PS: On an unrelated note, why the hell does every single elevator has to have mirrors? Who wrote this unwritten law first? It just gives me one more chance for not letting the elevator know where I want to go and follow a journey to a floor undesired with this lifeless but life sucking beast.</p>

			 <p>Prologue: I have been working on quite a lot of posts recently but could not finish them and bring them to any bloggable format. So finally decided I should repost some old post. Here goes one such post.<br /><br />Yesterday i had quite a random dream. Random indeed it was. For the most part of it i was pretty happy about what i was experiencing. And suddenly i went blank. I would say the dream went blank. Making me befuddled. Completely perplexed. Full of queries, queries for myself to answer. But before i get into the dream itself, let me blabber my views on dreams in general.<br /><br /><a href="http://elatedamit.wordpress.com/2008/09/19/switching-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignleft" style="border:10px;" title="Stranger" src="http://elatedamit.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/20070315093644_stranger_fog.jpg?w=199" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a>Dreams are angels. Yes, they have the power to make you experience the bests and worsts of your life at the same time. Indeed we experience the dreams, not just see them. How else can you explain your turning, jumping, twisting, crawling, grawling in the sleep. We are experiencing the event, the dream. I myself have woken up thanking god for turning whatever i experienced into a dream. And then there are those times when i just put myself to sleep again, just to experience what remained incomplete, unexperienced.<br /><br />Further, the dreams are mutable portkeys. I feel i change lives in dreams. Butterfly effect you can say. But there one can decide if he wants to change his life. Here i don’t. It all depends on my other self, the dreaming threaded me. If he wants me there, i go. Otherwise i just lay here, wake up and continue.<br /><br />Details. Two threads, if dreaming together, show how the life each is experiencing. We exchange both the positives and negatives. Yes, if you notice, each dream comprises of both goods and bads. We experience some scenes of that life, both happened and yet to happen. Yucks and Wows. If both agree to switch, we switch.<br /><br />Now you see this concept explains a lot of usualities. Take Deja Vu. Yes indeed it is that ‘yet-to-happen’ scene of the life. We experienced it in the dream before we made the shift. Those jerky wake ups. May be the other self just slapped me for spending such sucking life. Or may be i did it to him for his sucking life. Roaming with unknowns. Yes, you don’t afterall expect two me’s having the same set of friends. Those long nights can be the result of just a mismatch between timings of two threads. Same goes for the short nights.<br /><br />I will stop. Remove your thinking caps and plunge into the dreamland with the view. You might find quite a few interesting answers.<br /><br />Anyways back to my dream i dreamed yesterday. I dreamed i was a singer, i was singing well. (Ok, i never said the other me has to be “me”ish. He can indeed me quite contradictory to who i am right?) Audience were happy. I saw my struggle. I saw my first assignment. I was watching myself happy. I watched all the happy me’s. Nothing bad. No yucks. And suddenly it was blank. I don’t remember something like this happening earlier. The dreams changed. The places changed. I woke up suddenly. But it never happened that the dream turned blank, with me facing eternity full of whiteness.<br /><br />Puzzled, I lay there, closed eyed and open minded, waiting for something to happen. But all in vain. Blank. Whiteness everywhere. Finally i woke up and <a href="http://elatedamit.wordpress.com/2008/08/25/tottering-along/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tottered my way along</a> … With mind full of questions. Unanswered question.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Tomorrow I am going to travel through the time to the future me. It’s been long that I was planning for one such tour. However just for the need of the future currency, I had to postpone my travel to tomorrow.</p>
<br />
<p><img src="http://www.elatedamit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/time.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="Time Travel" style="float:left;padding-right:10px;" />In a moment, my friend will return from his visit. I have asked him to smuggle some future currency back to the past. To maintain the time conundrum, I will believe that, as of today, I do not know if he does bring it in. (However the fact remains that I have made the travel tomorrow. So this should clarify the doubts over whether he did. He did. Successfully. Believe me!)</p>
<br />
<p>Anyway there was some small calculation mistake while carrying the digit forward, which I normally do, that made me end up a day behind where I was supposed to end at, i.e. tomorrow. Now I do not want to disturb the normalities in here, the past world that is. So I will prefer hiding in this panic room and simply pen down my experiences of this drive.</p>
<br />
<p>The first and foremost observation, technology has spoiled the human race in there man. People only speak in command prompt queries. A sentence is no longer than 3 words, the longest (and oldest) being “I am sorry”. (And even there, people hardly mean it!)</p>
<br />
<p>Every single software is run by Google and hardware designed by Apple. There is an antique building called “Microsoft Live Centre”. I heard it has hanged in the messy green screen of death that displays a Matrixsque live feed of random numbers. Some say it has gone offline from the day it’s services were tagged “Live”. (By the way, don’t tell anyone. but there were still rumours about the apple tablet and google phone.)</p>
<br />
<p>However fun was when I met my future me. The way he was behaving I still feel, as <span style="font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaphod_Beeblebrox" title="Zaphod Beeblebrox" style="text-decoration:none;color:#002BB8;background-image:none;background-attachment:initial;background-origin:initial;background-clip:initial;background-color:initial;background-position:initial initial;background-repeat:initial initial;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zaphod Beeblebrox</a></span> would say, “if I ever met myself again, I will hit myself so hard I won’t know what’s hit me.”</p>
<br />
<p>By the way I wanted to tweet this there and then itself. But that future me just laughed at me when I said it takes 140 characters for us to share what we are doing. He mentioned even the novels are 20-30 characters long in there. The <i>crypto-tex-pander</i> fitted in each person’s eyes just completes the novel. Idiots I tell you.</p>
<br />
<p>Sat for lunch and there there was another surprise. Those idiots there hardly eat any food. They just gobble down the pills for all the necessary vitamins, minerals and whatever necessary for the body. Floored I was to see they even have the pills for the junk food. These future mens are idiots. Extreme idiots.</p>
<br />
<p>Oops!! Need to hide. Someone is crawling towards this dark damp corner. Will blab out the remaining idiocracies of the future. Trust me. There are many. Did I tell you what they have a UCC, a Universe Conservation Committee, a group fighting the Universal Enpansion? Well they do. Blab you later. Ciao!</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2009/12/14/211300.html">Thoughts on movie making (and reviewing)</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2009/12/14/211300.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2009-12-14 21:13:00 &#43;0530">Dec 14, 2009</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Just finished watching “The Negotiator”. A tense drama between two negotiators that was . Well at least for three-fourth of the movie. After which I think the director fell prey for the behaviour which I am seeing a lot recently. However I have no intention here to post a review about the movie.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:center;">  <img src="http://www.elatedamit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/200912142112.jpg" width="133" height="136" alt="200912142112.jpg" /></p>
<br />
<p>Actually these days I have lost belief that reviews actually hold any credibility. Not just do I find them monetarily inspired, but they are also dependent on many external factors. This makes it practically impossible for two viewers to watch a movie with same frame of mind and same expectations.</p>
<br />
<p>Well not to forget the reviews themselves rig their own viewpoint on the moviegoers. So a <a href="http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movies/reviews.html" target="_blank" title="Movie reviews by Taran Adarsh" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taran Adarsh</a> might make each Yash Raj Film an extreme must watch while <a href="http://features.ibnlive.in.com/show/now-showing.html" target="_blank" title="Masand's Verdict" rel="noopener noreferrer">Masand</a> makes the same one the extreme bore of all time. Two thumps down he would scream. However what the movie ends up being is not any of those.</p>
<br />
<p>Not just is this case true for the actual critics whose bread and butter is film reviewing. Even friends that unwelcomely review a movie for me, make it difficult for me to watch any. One likes any movie he watches, another says “ah Bollywood sucks”.</p>
<br />
<p>So hardly is it possible for me to decide which movie to watch based on anyone’s comments. Ironically the most of the movies that I have loved recently are the ones where I had no clue about their plot or performances. So no reviews for me I say.</p>
<br />
<p>Anyway back to the pit that most of the directors fall in. I call it the “<i>lets-make-it-goody-goody</i>&quot; pit. See when you have made a strong impression on audience by throwing at them what they least expected, you don’t take an unwanted <i>faltu</i> turn saying “Hehe buddy, there I fooled you.”</p>
<br />
<p>One most cliche scene I would like to mention. In a movie with 2 heroes, one kills other at the most unthinkable stage. Only is it revealed momentarily after that both were together in this and no one’s killed. That was part of the bigger plan. Villain is caught and yippie, everything is goody-goody.</p>
<br />
<p>Well, screw you Mr. Goody G. Goody. You could have made the movie hell lot better by killing that god damn hero, and making this <i>gaddar</i> friend fly away with villain and all the money. Why is there a mental block to show “<i>achhe ki jeet aur bure ki haar</i>&quot; (good wins bad leans)? Well not that this is how the real world behaves, is it?</p>
<br />
<p>Anyway even extreme wonderful movies like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/" target="_blank" title="The Departed" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Departed</a> could not dodge this pit. Only thing I can say is it takes guts to end movie with not so “goody-goody” a situation. I remember one movie which managed to do that. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884328/" target="_blank" title="The Mist" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Mist</a>. I still fell saddened when I remember the ending there. Hats off to you Mr. Frank Darabont the director. You had managed to give a most unthinkable horror an horror movie can give its audience. Extreme unthinkable.</p>

			 <p>He gets up in the morning and sees sun rising at him through the small slit, left open at the window by curtains. It is that soothing early morning which he has always savored. He crawls out of his bed and takes a warm shower. He gets all tidied up with a desire to embrace the pleasing spring morning. He puts his foot outside and starts his walk towards the office.<br /><br />Hardly does he walk hundred meters, dark clouds start gathering the sky. He looks at the sun and loses him among the clouds.  The spring morning is ruined by the darkness of the clouds hovering above. They roar and kill the sweet chirping noise of the birds and burst into a heavy uncalled and untimely rain suddenly.<br /><br />Now the situation above is not just a one off incident.  It is not the roaring clouds or the rain that bothers me. It is the untimely fashion one faces them. Any living person can personify the “he” described above.<br /><br />Have many times will I lure days in and out just for a moist rainy morning only to end up to be greeted by scorching heat?<br /><br />How many times will I leave the house to spend a pleasant summer weekend at the beach with family or friends only to end up sipping sodas in a closed car peeking at the pouring rain?<br /><br />Why should I always carry the sunscreen lotion and the umbrella with me irrespective of which season it is?<br /><br />As an Indian, I was blessed with distinguished 3 seasons. But these days everything has changed. Winters aren’t chilly. Summers have intermittent burst of clouds. Rainy seasons have hardly 30 days of rain. I won’t be exaggerating if I say that summers have more rains now than actual rainy seasons.<br /><br />I don’t know if this is actually a result of Global Warming phenomenon. I don’t know if this is really a effect of greenhouse gases. There are <a href="http://www.pewclimate.org/global-warming-basics/facts_and_figures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facts and figures</a> which say they are. Then there are those who say this is just a cyclic effect. This does happen in centuries where climate behavior repeats itself.<br /><br />For me what matters is what I see and I can guarantee something is for sure not normal. I am tired of watching farmers committing suicides because the climate does not behave as it should. I am tired of watching crops getting ruined by the lack or or sudden pouring of rains. I am tired of watching people die because of all the floods and droughts, storms and tsunami. I am really tired.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/09/climate_100.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">effects</a> of, if it exists, global warming are pretty saddening.  I had decided I won’t take the risk of ruining what has been a pretty wonderful place to live. I <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=10-solutions-for-climate-change&amp;page=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will do whatever</a> I can for that and have already started that by thinking about it.<br /><br />After all I don’t want to end up telling my grandchildren, “Once there were seasons and climate changed with them”. And I surely don’t want any one to end like this.<br /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-377  aligncenter" title="Global Warming" src="http://www.elatedamit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/global_warming1.jpg" alt="Global Warming" width="316" height="293" /></p>
<p><br /><br />PS: This is my attempt to put my views on climate change and participate with thousand others in <a href="http://www.blogactionday.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blog Action Day</a>.</p>

I don’t know why but this bud was heavily reluctant to let me do so. I gave up, placed the dial back and put my hand to get the coin back. In the open mouthed telephone lied another $2 coin with my $1 coin.<br /><br />Fuzzy that my mind always is, there began a <em>mahabharat </em>between my ethical and non-ethical brain cells. Should i or should not pick this $2 up which does not belong to me? I don’t remember for how long i stayed near the booth but last thing i remember i had extra $2 in my pocket. Debatable if i should have picked the coin, but i did.<br /><br />Fast forwarding 2 hours later. My idling location shifted to a mall where after about an hour i decided i have crossed my idling quota for the week.<br /><br />I came out with my iPod plugged in and whistled along the road towards train station and somehow felt everything was pretty bright around me. I knew i had a train in another 15 mins which i should not miss as there was no other train for another 90minutes. My eyes burnt and my subconscious mind was aching for something. And there it dawn on me why everything was indeed bright.<br /><br />Next thing i remember i was running towards the mall to find my goggles worth way more than $2 i had picked up earlier. Whole time during my run to the mall i was thinking was that $2 really worth all this pain of losing costly goggles and missing train.<br /><br />Final blow, however, was about to come. I reached the mall, found a sensible looking pretty lady and asked if they have found any goggles. She looked more optimistic than what I was. She ambled inside putting me on hold. After some time, she came out and said something which ignited my fuzzy brain cells again.<br /><br />She said they have found one goggles, but they were ladies and if I think mine were, well, ladies goggles, she will get them from the security. Now I did not want to make complete fool of myself in front to pretty looking and sounding girl by saying I wear ladies goggles. But i did not want to not make any try too.<br /><br />I thought for sometime what to do and then putting my manly pride ahead, I remember I mumbled something and came out. Whole time afterwards, i was soothing myself by thinking this.<br /></p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2009/09/21/002000.html">Getting Choosy at Supermarkets..</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2009/09/21/002000.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2009-09-21 00:20:00 &#43;0530">Sep 21, 2009</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A visit to a supermarket is not something uncommon for me. Rather it is one thing which i like doing the most. Crawling between those numerous branches full of variety of products, i just lose myself glancing at each one’s properties… beep .. engineer’s blooper .. i should have said “each one’s labels”.</p>
<p>However, the visits are always satisfying and refreshing for me. And this is the first reason i find myself roaming in these lanes quite often.</p>
<p>Another reason for these frequent ferries is my lack of interest in creating the grocery lists. I have tried jotting them few times, but i so get lost within the products catalog that the chit doozes in my pockets.</p>
<p>At times i spend hours just ambling around the nooks and corners of a supermarket. A sensible mind might think what would one do for so long in a place so crowded, so noisy, so meaningless and so mean. But thats what i like about this place. I get my space in here with no one remotely worried about what i want. And that’s when i start getting choosy about each and everything i would buy out of this space.</p>
<p>First thing i need to do is put a limit on time i would spend in there. Once that is sorted out, it is all about marking my spots to ski along. Vegetables and fruits fall out of my interest and a hustling visit settles down the formality.</p>
<p>What follows is a child-like admiration for the variety of products manufactured, packaged, transported, marketed and sold at such colorful a place. A cheerful mouthfreshner sits in front of the saddened and ashamed toilet cleaner. Colorful chocolates sit next to the colorless eggs. And there i know its time to get lost. Get choosy.</p>
<p>And choosy i get. Tens of minutes are spent in front of each product looking for what fits better for my needs. I know sometimes i have spent too much time and worried i get thinking the cameras might caught me goofing around at the same position and i might be busted as potential terrorist. But what the hell  .. risk is worth it.</p>
<p>And then there are those times when i don’t get choosy thinking i know what i want and i have got what i want. And this is what i buy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>And this is what the description read (which i happen to read when i rinsed my mouth with this dude)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">For healthier mouth, remind kids to brush their teeth and use Listerine Smart Rinse twice a day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Listerine Smart Rinse for Kids 6+</p>

			 <p>These days i am going through some wonderful experiences. Major chunk for this: I have the routine in Bangalore broken. I was fed up with the same life style. Same road. Same bus. Same timings. Same place. Same updates. Same people. And even same dogs!<br /><br />Life at Australia has given me that chance to break the shackles with <em>usuality</em>. The life has changed and so have people, places around me. I am not a pleasure freak. The only thing I ask for is the change. For that matter I do not even mind spending my days at a village as long as I get a break from usual casualties of life.<br /><br />Casualties they are. Each moment each day life throws loads and loads of experiences at you. Some are feather soft. Providing you with the feel-good comfort in its zone. And then there are those emotion laden heavy experiences trying to crush you under it’s weight. Casualties to your mind is what they can leave behind. And casualties is what they leave behind.<br /><br />So the break was indeed welcome. It has indeed been welcome. For the better part of this change is the feeling of <em>differentness</em>. But this same “<em>differentness</em>&quot; is what pops up in between; a small compartment in mind still calls out for those same buses. Those same roads. Those same people. And those same dogs. In between some times a thought does crawl in the mind; a thought calling out for those &ldquo;<em>usualities</em>”. Calling out loud for the sameness in the life.</p>

			 <p style="text-align:left;">Incidents wait for a perfect time to pounce on you, especially the bad ones. One such incident pounced on him too. One fine morning, it was.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:left;">Alike any normal day, he woke fully throttled up, with a hope for fruitful work at office. He rushed through the daily chores, preparing himself for the regular grinding sessions. However there was a tinge of excitement within him today. Surprised as he was with his full on enthu to reach office, a thought brushed his mind, &#8221; something new, something good is about to happen today&#8221;. He knew today was, in someway, special.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:left;">He jumped into the office bus, just to get further surprised. Usually crowded, the bus welcomed him today to free spaces. He chose the best among the window seats. <em>Clouds had already swarmed the Bangalore skies</em>, further elevating his pleasant mood. &#8220;Something is surely in the air today&#8221;, he thought.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:left;">Whole day he yearned for the change he was sensing from the morning. However except for the persistent <em>clouds</em>, nothing indeed was pleasing him. He had a pretty workless day, which he hardly abhorred. But something was missing. He knew that, he felt that.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:left;">And then, on the verge of he giving up on any hope for the welcome change, it loomed, loomed through the hazy weather. He was introduced to the One. He was informed that One would be bossing him now onwards. The first few sentences from the One and he knew this was the change he has been desiring for. Fully impressed he was with the One&#8217;s fluent and vast knowledge flow. Fully impressed he was with the One&#8217;s sensitiveness for a person&#8217;s goals. Fully impressed he was with the One&#8217;s clarity of thoughts. Fully impressed he was with the One.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:left;">Few chats later an invitation was thrown at him, &#8221; Join me for a smoke. Will you?&#8221; And that is how it all started. The incident had pounced on him, he though remained unaware. It all started one morning, one fine morning&#8230;</p>
<br />

			 <p>I had earlier prated at facebook about how things never go wrong but they usually are wrong. This post is more about the incident that made me babble that out.<br /><br />This particular incident is not a one off experience. It happens with me most of the time. I have started believing the quote, that one gets what he gets only when the time is right, far strongly than ever before.<br /><br />So right from the morning today, i was hopelessly beating my head against numerous things interconnected. Code not getting configured, tools not running properly, system slowing down like hell … and what not. In simple terms, all the things that could possibly go wrong were going wrong.<br /><br />Tried my best to bring things back on track. Even tried the ever successful way out of chanting random rants in the loo. But nothing seamed to work. Day went by with me fighting the villainous time. And suddenly right on the verge of me giving up, something happened and everything got sorted out.<br /><br />I felt like yash raj was scripting a movie with me, the helpless protagonist waiting for the <em>non-hero-non-villain types </em>neutral time to sort things out, a la Amrish puri in <a title="DDLJ" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112870/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DDLJ</a>. Here ditto Yash Raj’s script, how the solution appears does not matter.<br /><br />Many times the all time hidden <em>problem creators</em> suddenly loom out of nothingness. Or at times the same components which were adamant on not working get a mind change and start working. You sit there dumbfound trying to grasp what happened. Worse is when all the twisted knots straighten up when a new person pulls a thread, making one look a complete idiot.<br /><br />By the way today’s was the first case. The bugger emerged from the tonnes of characters and the problem got solved. Time was 7:02pm. Felt i was destined to solve the problem, but not before 7:00pm 28th May.<br /><br />A new problem, as usual, has come into existence tough. Yashji’s planning a magnum opus this time, i guess. So awaiting another day of head banging for a solution which i know i won’t get before <em>the time gets right</em>.<br /><br /><em>Nothing actually goes wrong, it is always wrong. What is worth mentioning tough is when it goes right!!</em></p>

			 <p>Another day spent with hardly any interesting updates in life. Truly speaking many things happen. Mind wanders around, surfs over various topics instead of diving deep into a single significant job at hand. Result is i am unable to get attached to any of the things happening around me.<br /><br />The question arises what really does one need to make the mind notice what is happening around? Interest in what we do should be the first and most important thing. But what I don’t understand is why do i suddenly take raw interest in the same work which i wasn’t enjoying earlier. It must rather be something else .<br /><br />According to me, they are the things that happen around me that actually decide if i notice what is happening around or not. If my mind feels they are worth noticing, it will notice them. Else it temporarily captures the images just to wipe it off the mind’s canvas, sooner rather than later. The problem is this “sooner” comes too soon for me to make even a slight impact.<br /><br />Does this mean things around me are insignificant? I don’t thing so. Rather the things around me these days are like the monotonic long silences in Oscar winning movies; they are no way insignificant, however they hardly make any sense to me. I would rather prefer the insignificant, but joyous jabbers of Adam Sandler than Leone’s blunt eye shots. And i need to soon find these jabbers around me!<br /><br /><strong>Update: </strong>Just watched this wonderful village lady, Susan Boyle, nailing another awesome of her performance. This lady has provided some thirlls and excitement in <em>waise</em> monotonous life.<br /><br />Witness yourself: <a title="Susan Boyle - Memory" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLLIIb_jA9Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLLIIb_jA9Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLLIIb_jA9Y">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLLIIb_jA9Y</a></a></a></p>

			 <p style="text-align:justify;">As i was <a title="Tottering along the floor to.." href="http://www.elatedamit.com/2008/08/tottering-along/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tottering along the floor</a> today, i reached the door of the washroom whose door, thanks to the awesomely random designs, opens inside. So a person standing in the washroom is bound to get a hit for just boasting to his mirror self on how handsome he really is. Anyway so today as i reached the door, a person came out and we just had a eye to eye contact. There was no collision nor even a touch involved. But the first thing i spoke was &#8220;Oh, I am sorry&#8221;. I was like dude, this is too much. Why do i have to blabber out this senseless &#8220;S&#8221; word first thing, irrespective of what the situation is?</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Few worse situations do come in my mind. I have never been in the &#8220;outside washroom door opener&#8221; category. I always get hit. Now even if i do get hit, the first thing that comes out of my mouth is &#8220;Am sorry&#8221;. I always think why do i have to be so passive when it is me who is hurt. However it is not like i always am passive about the things when i speak the &#8220;S&#8221; word. Even are the situation when i go sorry with a tone of &#8220;<em>you ba**ard</em>&#8221;. May be i have developed a way to swear by not really swearing. You know that cute little silence maintained when someone is boasting about himself, just to convey &#8220;go to hell. am least interested.&#8221; I guess this is something on similar lines.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover its not just about the &#8220;S&#8221; word. He has got an equally senseless stepbrother which goes something like &#8220;Thank you&#8221;, the &#8220;T&#8221; word. Now this too is used in a similar context free manner. I remember a time when i thanked a guy who actually was helped out by me from a critical situation.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">These situation make me think, is there really any use of the words like sorry and thank you when they are used so freely without really giving a second thought on why am sorry about or what am thanking about. Leave aside the crap that it helps in conveying some feelings. Com&#8217;on, there are better ways to communicate the same feelings. After all words are not everything. An expression like below can surely make anyone forgive others. Silence is golden as they say. Rather i feel silence, bundled with perfect expression, speaks a thousand words!</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-311 alignnone" src="http://www.elatedamit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/sorry-300x286.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="286" /></p>

			 <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Learning how to drive has been too easy these days my friend”, he said, “It’s a simple principle. Throw money learn honey. I learnt it not by choice, but by compulsion.” He had a sense of austerity in his voice. I knew i was about to embark on a journey of one of his lifetime experiences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though highly disinterested, flaunting my&nbsp; phony curiosity i queried, “So when did you learn driving then.” I was more worried about me bumping the vehicle into the truck ahead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Long back,” going into a hazy flashback, he said. “The moment i knew school is not my liking and studies hardly interest me, my family started looking for some work for me. There was no concept of job actually. There was work which would earn money for the supper. Who best to earn it than a lone useless, dumb fellow in the house”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frisking what i listened for a question to throw back, i asked him “So you were the eldest? The only bread earner in your family?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a sudden smirk on his face, he replied ” Actually i am the youngest among the siblings. I have 3 older brothers, all well educated and hold nice jobs. But soon they left the home. Ashamed may be of the illiteracy in the family.” I knew the reason was more a taunt to them than a reason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“So what did you do then”, I asked him, my eyes glued to the traffic signal ahead approaching faster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I didn’t have to do anything actually. Those were the days when the transport business was calling out for unskilled labour as conductors. My father pushed me into one. The work was simple. Whatever the king of the truck, the driver<em> ustaad</em> would say, the conductor would do. Whatever was literally ‘whatever’, including washing vehicle, buying him a beer bottle, <em>bidis</em>, making him a peg, washing the beer glasses. Anything and everything which by social thoughts would sound as child torture.” I hoped he was not talking about sexual one though.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being a bad listener to one’s saddest and ugliest of the experiences, i did not want to go in the details of the torture. I queried him further “So what about driving then?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<em>Aye bha*ve hat na baju</em>” he sweared at a cycle rickshaw ahead. The rickshaw puller pedaled for another 100 meters before siding, least affected by the blasphemous outrage thrown at him. “These bloody idiots wont listen as long as you don’t use below-abdomen swears. <em>Maa Behen pe na jao to palle nahi padta inke.</em> My <em>ustaad</em> always used to tell me, best horn is that which is particularly customized for the one you are blowing at. Use your mouth in cities more than honking”. I decided not to listen to this teaching of his, not for now at least.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Anyway about the driving, that was another role the conductor has to play when the driver was <em>talli </em>with beer. Suddenly one day he would pass the steering half crawling and say <em>sambhal isko</em>. It started with a prank, when <em>ustaad </em>had a good laugh along with his drunkard gang over my terrified face. I came to know after few months that actually that was the first step of my driving class under <em>ustaad</em>. That was my first experience of driving.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Damn interested i asked, “So what next. Did he teach or just played rash on you?”&nbsp; Cool and calm, he pointed at a tea corner and said, ” For now i am teaching you. Lets take a break. Lots of rash experiences did follow. The experiences that collated to form my driving sessions. <em>Aaram se baithke sunte hain.</em> <em>Do kadak chai dena chotya. Special.</em>“</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I awaited agog to listen to his series of driving sessions with his eccentric <em>ustaad</em>. I knew there were many experiences worth pondering over going to be unbundled soon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the other side,<em> Chotya</em> was cleaning the table in front of me. Suddenly he looked to me completely oblivious of the experience he was part of.</p>

			 <p style="text-align:justify;">Another day goes by. Each day passes with me starting my day with a plan to blog about the zillions of ideas i have sidelined over the week now. I have to put a sticky post something on this guy&#8217;s face. This is a lame effort atleast to make that face a bit freshen.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">So just to update, i am fed up with the monotony my life has been following. The following picture catches this phase of my life perfectly. I am facing the same soul deadening monotony.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-176 aligncenter" title="soul-deadning-monotony" src="http://elatedamit.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/soul-deadning-monotony.jpg?w=300" alt="soul-deadning-monotony" width="300" height="212" /></p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyways i have made my mind now. I am working on a story that i heard from a person who taught me a lot over the period of 3 days. It has to come out. I will do that. Soon.</p>

			 <p style="text-align:justify;">Now that&#8217;s not just a random title that i chalked out. Actually it is a fact. I read today that a person&#8217;s brain is the most fatty organ in his body!</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surprised? Even i was. I mean common. How can a tummy, that can expand to store 4 liters of food i.e. 50 times its empty size, be less fatty than a brain? Even if it is fat, should i even care. I think no one is faintly concerned about some fat crawling over a body part which one does not ,or rather <strong>cannot</strong>, flaunt.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as i snaked through the article further, i found one interesting fact. Thanks to that, i can now  sleep as long as i want. It seems when a person sleeps, his brain gets busy to file away all the memories of the day. I can now disportingly say that &#8220;I am gyming my brain dude. Fats are crawling even in the blood vessels now and my brain does not want to die devoid of oxygen&#8221;. Put on a board saying &#8220;Fat brain at work&#8221; and rumble along the snoring dreams.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-290 aligncenter" title="Fatty brain" src="http://www.elatedamit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/fatty-brain-300x252.jpg" alt="Fatty brain" width="240" height="202" /></p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh yeah. Even regarding dreams there are few interesting facts that the brain spins. Have you ever questioned yourself why you don&#8217;t actually act what you are dreaming? Or even simplest form saying what in fact are dreams? <a title="Switching Lives" href="http://www.elatedamit.com/2008/09/switching-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I do have</a>. Though one thing i missed is a fact that 12% of the people dream in black and white. I just have one doubt here. What is the criteria that decides whether you will dream in 35mm technicolor or age old BnW? Whatever, its just another example of pointless statistics.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover it seems your brain cheats you when you sleep by releasing some kind of hormone which actually <strong>paralyzes</strong> you. The sole intention is to make sure you don&#8217;t wake up next morning bawling about your aching bum which you hurt when you were horse riding in the dream. In short, it makes sure you don&#8217;t act your dreams. How i wish the brain was not so cruel on mankind. I mean, won&#8217;t it be good to actually go ahead and gym out your body too as the brain is getting fat burned. C&#8217;mon, it does afterall know the burden of carrying along the extra fat</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyways, few more interesting facts are canned at the below link. Just go ahead and tickle your fatty brain</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p style="text-align:justify;">Just when i think not to trouble my mind, saturated by randomness to its full, i come across the little gems like this.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a title="Goat detained over armed robbery" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090123/od_nm/us_goat;_ylt=Ag7ntPE15g0Li3_NWwySSlgSH9EA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090123/od_nm/us_goat;_ylt=Ag7ntPE15g0Li3_NWwySSlgSH9EA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090123/od_nm/us_goat;_ylt=Ag7ntPE15g0Li3_NWwySSlgSH9EA</a></a></p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Apparently police in Nigeria detained a goat on the suspicion of attempting an armed robbery. Yes. You heard it right. Goat arming itself up with a shotgun and making the Vigilante men stare down the gun nozzle? All for a Mazda 323? I mean common. A Mazda 323 can only be as useful to a goat as a padded two&#8217;s to Pamela. If you neglect the lone possibility of she pooping on it. If it has been for &#8220;hay&#8221;, there was at least a chance of this happening.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">That&#8217;s not it all. Actually there were a couple of them. Dude, coupling Hayek with Pamela still keep padded ones look useless. Moreover a couple of goats stealing a car? I know scientists are trying weird experiments on animals these days like cloning n all. But i never heard of such advanced experiment of churning out a species with body of goat and mind of <a title="No Country for Old Men" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477348/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anton Chigurh</a>. Not even on the fastest news reporting channel on this bloody earth, &#8220;<a href="http://aajtak.itgo.in/index.php?issueid=&amp;id=&amp;option=com_registration&amp;task=videopage&amp;assignedvideoid=4989&amp;sectionid=16&amp;secid=0&amp;start_bottom=16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aajtak</a>&#8221;. So if its not reported on Aajtak yet, its not possible even for 10 years now.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although the main part is what might suit the tastes of few channels here. You see actually they were two guys who were trying to rob the car when the Vigilantes confronted them. One ran and other turned himself into the goat. Now the dangerous little goat is in custody and the police are waiting to prove it scientifically that it actually is possible to convert a person into a goat magically(!). Now i get it. So it was not the goat who was robbing armed, it was actually a man.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">But now that it is crystal clear, i do not have even a single word to speak? First thing they actually do not shoot the white n black beast wearing so dangerous a throne of horn right at sighting it. Secondly they ask to prove that it is possible that an armed man can be converted into a goat? Common. The scientist have long discovered the dose to convert the buffalo-like-hardly-rising small dumb little ball of flesh into an ultra-active-hard-hitting beast. They call it an energy drink which does transform a sleepy crawling man into an awesome enthusiast you see. So calming down the beast to a goat look alike is just too easy a job. Just a bit of physical transformation is required that&#8217;s it.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here i urge the related police staff to take a strict action against the goat and hang her till her death. The man that actually has transformed himself into goat is too dangerous for this world and so are his accessary. I heard they are working on something which can make this happen&#8230;</p>
<br />

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2009/01/28/230303.html">Why does darkness exist?</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p style="text-align:justify;">I have been gliding in the darkness for around 3 hours now, for one simple reason. The tube light in my room suddenly felt a strong desire not to glow. It went on blinking at me, i guess trying to figure out if i have worn any .. pajamas or not. I did try and rotate it around, with it never returning me a stare. While spending my precious time there, stroking the keyboard in darkness, a question just poked its head out of the ruffled mind. Why the heck is the darkness there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-166 alignleft" title="bulb1" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2020/e929579408.jpg" alt="bulb1" width="130" height="92" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I mean, ok fine. I know why it is there. I do have scribbled through the endless questions on solar system and planets structure and their hecking orbits. But i am not concerned about its how it exists. Rather i want to know how useful is it. I just want to justify its existence with one hell of a random reason, the farther it is from the truth, better it is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I feel everything that exists, does so for some random reason. Even the minutest thing like a microbe is there because it leads or conjoins together to form or shape something awesomely important like virus, lets say. Yes they are weighty in a sense to control the growth of the big parasites in the form of humans. Similarly something like air, whose presence cannot be seen, is there to blow the smelly farts away. The sole reason for such senselessly senseless arguments is to emphasize the point that, yes, each thing can be tagged with the reason for its existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But even the random mind of mine could not reasonify the existence of darkness. To develop films?? Nah, very few do that now and those who do it actually do it by pulling over darkness. We are focusing on the natural darkness that arises with night.  To sleep??? Nah, actually sleep has got more to do with the time than it has got to do with darkness.  What then?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I know i am acting a bit ignorant, by may be neglecting many scientific things. I actually want to because i want some reason out of my mutable mind. The only reason i can think of gives me goosebumps.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I feel the whole purpose of darkness is to hide the light. So darkness is not "non-existence of light". But actually it is the other way round. Light is "non-existence of darkness". Whenever there is something that nature wants to do without making humans aware, it pushes darkness in. So it must be doing something at each night. Intercourse? Quite possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An argument can be made saying people do put on the lights then. But actually you see, that's the reason they just blink sometimes rather than staring. And thats the reason am in dark today. Nature is at work. Reproducing :)</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2009/01/08/005741.html">What really is ambition?</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p style="text-align:justify;">Today it happened again. A previous <a title="What Happened to my Ambitions" href="http://snoozyrealm.wordpress.com/2008/09/26/what-happened-to-my-ambitions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> has had many hits from the Google search. I know there is nothing surprising about this part. But what follows is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The query type was usually like "My ambition in life" or "My ambition" or "What are my ambitions" or "My plans and ambitions". One query was also of the sort saying "Why have i lost my ambition". Instant reaction was like, ok, i know Google does answer your query. But i dearly wish it does not move to this personal level. I dearly wish a day would never come when i would google for "Where have i forgotten my underwear". I dearly wish i don't.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But after some time, I thought fare enough. Someone must have searched for an essay with this topic. Afterall even i remember how, during the 2nd -5th standard, my ambition changed with changing teachers and essay books. It mutated from a nation serving politician or soldier to a hard-working-son-of-soil farmer to a life saving doctor. Frankly speaking, considering the level of english i could blabber on my own, the essay that was not lengthy enough not to be mugged up, at the same time sounded good and earned marks had content for "My ambition". But i don't remember myself ever scribbling about being a "gibberish-speaking" sleepy bug dwelling in virtual reality, being a computer engineering, i.e., to be specific.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyways this fact urged me to think what really is an ambition. I thought of mining the precise definition for the word and to my surprise what it really means is "an ardent desire to achieve something". An ardent desire? That is it? Boss, i have been ceaselessly told my ambition has to foretell a long time down the future. All those "cheek-bursting" aunts and grandmas and uncles danced on my head for ages to know what i would be when i grow old, what is my ambition. I always doubted if they wanted to boggle the million rupees estate i would have. To such extent was my fear that i started publishing "social service" as my ambition just to push the demons away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But now i feel pity that i was wandering along without really answering that question in the best way. If an ardent desire is what ambition is all about, then yes i would have had hundreds of ambitions. And the list has grown to a thousands now with passing age. With each ambition i achieved, i feel i have installed few more in the list. I know and still remember the whole gyan about a life lived without ambition is like an arrow fired without an aim. But then if i have to talk practically I feel it is highly impossible to lay the path for whole life right at the birth. Nah one can't.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that does not mean as a child i spent my life without an aim. I still had an aim to complete my homework just to rush out to play hide n seek or help mom out with an aim to go out for a walk in some mela or finish every possible household exercises even on a foggy Sunday with an aim just to use that as an excuse while am watching a cricket match. Now i know these were my ambitions. Far more practical than being a politician or a doctor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes i know there are still these whole lot of concepts of long term goal and short term goals and art of living and blah. So I feel skeptic to use ambition as a word. I feel i better call it a simple desire.  I have decided to pursue my billions of small but practical desires under the hood of long term, impractical or rather unverifiable ambition of being a respected and followed both professionally and personally. I have <a title="What happened to my ambition?" href="http://snoozyrealm.wordpress.com/2008/09/26/what-happened-to-my-ambitions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already mentioned</a> how my ambitions faded away with time. I know my desires won't. I would be happy if the list grows to some tens of thousands, that would imply that i atleast completed 100 such desires. 100 such ambitionsi will call them.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2008/12/27/203518.html">A passage I long to live...</a></h1>

			 <p style="text-align:justify;">Just finished watching the most wondrous poem on love and life, "Before Sunrise". I am so damn impressed. Its pretty amazing how the author's, the director's view can change a dragging chitchatting of a "just-met" couple into such awesome a journey for the viewer too. I mean, even i kind of get surprised that i thoroughly enjoyed a normal passage of some hours of two-people's life, their passage from strangers to lovers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-155" title="before_sunrise_film" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2020/4f257ae125.jpg" alt="before_sunrise_film" width="207" height="300" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything about this movie left me impressed. The sweet time it takes to unfold itself, the locales of Vienna crawling beautifully behind the leads, the gentle music in the background. All these small little things just heaved my experience of what lied at the core, the subtle talks of the couple in lead. I relished everything the author was trying to say. It made me think, made me revisit my thoughts about many things. I mean not just about love, about life too. All it had to say about death, god etc. Small little gems like the one when the actress, Celine, talks about the old man who spent his whole life thinking about his career and his work. That was just a spectacularly well written scene.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And about love, well its better experienced in the movie itself. I am speechless, out of word to spell out my experience. Its not just for the one's in love, but also for the others to relish.  All those  pretty words, the moist  eyed stares, those mushy silences, the tender touches. Everything. The poem in particular written with so plain a word, milkshake, as its base. Man, spectacular is the word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, I want to wend one such passage before sunrise in my life, if possible in Vienna. And yes, if so beautiful is love crafted on the moving canvas, am sure i won't be alone feeling that way.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2008/12/11/210824.html">Why do I even try?</a></h1>

			 <p style="text-align:justify;">True. I try like hell not to listen to him. He goes on bumping my head. But i remain focused. He bribes me with what i like. He threatens me to run away and never return. I try not to fall for his tactics. But finally i do. I pretend i will shoo him away, but that's the whole problem. I pretend...</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just a scenario, perfectly captured by Dilbert:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:0 none;" src="http://dilbert.com/dyn/str_strip/000000000/00000000/0000000/000000/30000/1000/900/31968/31968.strip.gif" border="0" alt="Dilbert.com" width="448" height="139" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyways this bloody culprit in Internet just doesn't allow me to work my plans. I plan not to plan any plan, so that i don't feel bad when this plan of not to plan goes helter-skelter, unplanned. Thanks a lot internet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let me explain a bit. I reach home with a plan to read my novel, just to find the internet 'psst'ing at me. Calls me out to check my mails, read some scraps, check out some news on tech n all. And everyday i do fall for something or the other. I unknowingly, or that's what i pretend, plug the cable on and surf through the net.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Actually i did well in between to overcome this weakness of mine. I never fell for anything of sorts. But again somehow he has caught another of my nerve. He actually works stepwise now. Makes me switch on the powerplug spike for charging my mobile. He knows i am pretending to be just charging the mobile and i will turn on the laptop next. And everytime he turns out to be right. I pretend to turn the laptop on just for a bit to work something out and shut it down. But he knows that is not going to happen. Once the laptop starts he reminds me of something i need to do on net. I again pretend not to be surfing the net but just using it for a moment. But in fact, thats what i turn out to be doing. Surfing the internet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes i ask myself why do i even try. I know i am failing to boggle my mind away from this culprit. But somehow i think this is that cunning but wonderous buddy with whom you can neither subsist nor part. Yes, that's what he is. Cunning, but wonderous.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://snoozyrealm.wordpress.com/2008/10/09/nine/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-139" title="nine1" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2020/60f7282d48.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="126" /></a>Nine... A number that has haunted me for more than a month. Would wake up with a stare at it. Take a shower, get ready and face the indolently eying number. Stagger while using it. Bump into it daily. On numerous incidents. Each one having a negative effect on my mood. Just adding to my already tangled life. Twisting it further. Something usual has happened today too. Today i.e. on 9th of this month. 9th. And hence this post.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yeah i know. The prologue does seem a bit dramatized. But last part is indeed true. The normal routine things for last one-one n a half month have made me bump into '9', unusually, a lot. And it has succeeded in screwing up my mood on most of the occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First up. The most common and tiresome experience of my life. I have been staying on the ninth floor of a "still-under-construction" n beta version of a 15 floored guesthouse. Thats not all. Its each and every part was under development and testing at the same time. And we, the guests, were bloody testers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Lets start with a moment to reach there. You say use lifts. Simple right? Not so soon. The 3000 capacity guest house just had a single lift working for major part of my stay. Best being 2. You say "whats the big deal"? Ok, this lift can be any one of the 10 lifts scattered at various different locations on the ground floor. You say "uhh now thats complex". I say wait. Not all are on the ground floor. 2 are on first. Further take this. Each lift can take you only till/to a particular floor after or below which you have to scroll using stairs. Does that sound scary? Listen to this. The lifts were also in the "under-development-and-testing-part" list as most other parts and so had a most ill programmed chip fitted into her. Usual symptoms:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
    <li>She used to wend  the 1st-&gt; 0th floor path via 10th floor. That too without any entrant.</li>
    <li>She used to suddenly halt its march on the most deserted floor, without sucking anyone in or puking anyone out.</li>
    <li>She used to make you guess the time she would take to shut her doors for you. It ranged from sweet 10-20 secs after you are mounted or a quarter of a second by which you escaped getting crushed between her doors. (Yes she had no sensors to detect if you were in between her claws-like doors.)</li>
    <li>She used to making a most ear-deafening moan if you make her wait for a little longer. (A typical girlish behavior. You are not allowed any mistake to be made on your part.)</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://snoozyrealm.wordpress.com/2008/10/09/nine/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-138" title="03102008072" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2020/49a2a95cd3.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="135" /></a>By god's grace i did reach the coveted 9th floor most of the times. The fact that it normally took me around 10 mins on average matters least considering what lied ahead. The floor was divided, in true sense, in 3 parts using wooden walls. So care had to be taken that you end up in your part. Else you had to crawl through the stair case. The corridors were mostly cementy because of its under contruction tags with most confusing directions (refer snap). Air conditioners in the room worked on random basis and when they did they made my teeths tremble with cold. The taps randomly decided the temperature of the water that come out. (I have got my bum burned once. No further explanations.) The mirror was situated at the darkest corner of the room with the most clearly visible part being my toe nail.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have spent 44 days in this complete mystery house. There were other encounters with nine like never returned 9 rupees as change at the food terminals, 9 cubicals that i hopped along or the  9AM alarm that brought with it the invitation to begin the journey on mystery land of nine. The tales of these will follow up sometime later.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally there was just one saving grace i had with me which provided me the sole reason to go through this tortourous journey. People close to me know whom am speaking about. But i am observing a striking pattern there too. Each 9th of a month brings with it some problems. I can't explain but it does. I hope this hauting effect of 9 stops pressing me to my limits. I hope it stops testing my patience. Signs are not too good. Post is published in the 9th hour of the second half of the day. Ninth hour. Nine.</p>

			 <p style="text-align:justify;">I have always been faced with this puzzle for quite long now. What happened to me shouting i would have best house on the whole street? What happened to my plans buying the best car in the town? Where is that dream life with servants running all round? The fridge full of ice creams, pastries, chocolates, chicken (leg-straigntened sky-pointing turkey, to be precise) ? The television set running just cartoon movies day long with remote just in my hand? To be the richest man, the most honest person, the man blessed by blessings from poor, loved by one n all. The whole lust for attaining some position, achieving some goal, some ambition seems to be lost somewhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And now? Now is the case i have just one ambition left. Crawl through the work week mechanically just to feel and shout: TGIF... Thank God Its Friday.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally i have found the reason for this loss of ambition. See and examine it for yourself :)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://snoozyrealm.wordpress.com/2008/09/26/what-happened-to-my-ambitions/"><img class="size-large wp-image-132 aligncenter" title="Ambition as life moves.." src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2020/91a444900a.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="199" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now i know who uhhh what is the culprit. And yes TGIF :D</p>

			 <p style="text-align: justify;">Yesterday i had quite a random dream. Random indeed it was. For the most part of it i was pretty happy about what i was experiencing. And suddenly i went blank. I would say the dream went blank. Making me befuddled. Completely perplexed. Full of queries, queries for myself to answer. But before i get into the dream itself, let me blabber my views on dreams in general.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://snoozyrealm.wordpress.com/2008/09/19/switching-lives/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-123" title="Stranger" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2020/c3ee20b08f.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a>Dreams are angels. Yes, they have the power to make you experience the bests and worsts of your life at the same time. Indeed we experience the dreams, not just see them. How else can you explain your turning, jumping, twisting, crawling, grawling in the sleep. We are experiencing the event, the dream. I myself have woken up thanking god for turning whatever i experienced into a dream. And then there are those times when i just put myself to sleep again, just to experience what remained incomplete, unexperienced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Further, the dreams are mutable portkeys. I feel i change lives in dreams. Butterfly effect you can say. But there one can decide if he wants to change his life. Here i don't. It all depends on my other self, the dreaming threaded me. If he wants me there, i go. Otherwise i just lay here, wake up and continue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Details. Two threads, if dreaming together, show how the life each is experiencing. We exchange both the positives and negatives. Yes, if you notice, each dream comprises of both goods and bads. We experience some scenes of that life, both happened and yet to happen. Yucks and Wows. If both agree to switch, we switch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now you see this concept explains a lot of usualities. Take Deja Vu. Yes indeed it is that 'yet-to-happen' scene of the life. We experienced it in the dream before we made the shift. Those jerky wake ups. May be the other self just slapped me for spending such sucking life. Or may be i did it to him for his sucking life. Roaming with unknowns. Yes, you don't afterall expect two me's having the same set of friends. Those long nights can be the result of just a mismatch between timings of two threads. Same goes for the short nights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will stop. Remove your thinking caps and plunge into the dreamland with the view. You might find quite a few interesting answers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyways back to my dream i dreamed yesterday. I dreamed i was a singer, i was singing well. (Ok, i never said the other me has to be "me"ish. He can indeed me quite contradictory to who i am right?) Audience were happy. I saw my struggle. I saw my first assignment. I was watching myself happy. I watched all the happy me's. Nothing bad. No yucks. And suddenly it was blank. I don't remember something like this happening earlier. The dreams changed. The places changed. I woke up suddenly. But it never happened that the dream turned blank, with me facing eternity full of whiteness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Puzzled, I lay there, closed eyed and open minded, waiting for something to happen. But all in vain. Blank. Whiteness everywhere. Finally i woke up and <a href="http://snoozyrealm.wordpress.com/2008/08/25/tottering-along/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tottered my way along</a> ... With mind full of questions. Unanswered question.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p style="text-align:justify;">Along my surf through the web net (<em>hmm tautology</em>), found a lively garfield (<em>now oxymoron</em>) cartoon.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.elatedamit.com/blabber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19" title="Garfield" src="http://www.elatedamit.com/blabber/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/lga080819.gif" alt="" width="500" height="147" /></a></p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now same is with me. Truly i feel i draw a quite of  parallels with the dude Garfield. I am lazy, a bit overweight and i adore eating and sleeping. Even i hate Mondays (more on that <a href="http://www.elatedamit.com/2008/01/operation-not-afraid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) and feel diet is a &#8220;die&#8221; with T. Me too hate spiders. A kind of sudden chill runs down my spine when i face that fraternity. Even the lucky bite for Peter Parker could not change my lovely hatred for spiders. I have tried entering a lot of weird things mind including fruits, mornings and various other animates and inanimates.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="alignleft" title="Garfield" src="http://www.elatedamit.com/blabber/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/200px-garfield.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="271" /></p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this strip just elevated my similarity levels with garfield. I feel i, too, am a little too &#8216;<em>Garfieldish</em>' generous. I mean i provide my helping hand to someone just to end up with a feeling that i was too generous to do that. All because i was totally involved working his work out (!!!) I mean why do i have to do that. No need. What rather i should have done was to just provide a helping hand. Not my full hand.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">I know garfield won&#8217;t have worked this way. He would never have worked this hard. I need to do that too. I need to learn that too. Stop working. Just provide the helping hand and remove it. Anyways the help hardly gets noticed in todays world. Am i turing selfish? Yep&#8230; thats another parallel with Garfield!</p>

			 <p style="text-align:justify;">Now this is the topic that hits me everyday, atleast 3 times a day.. uhh .. usually more than that. Somehow i could not pen it out. Finally here it is. But before i move forward,  a confession. This post is mainly with reference to the males. Am not sure how it applies to the other sex. But lemme just blabber it out...</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Each day i usually rise, <em>heavy stomached and ill faced</em>, from my seat. Do something awkward between strolling and bustling. Course the floors of my office/home. Finally bang the door and enter the place. And choose a <em>urinal</em>. Now that's where it is supposed to end. But it does not. Something more happens. More on it in a wink.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let me first speak out the reason for this whole rush. Firstly i have somehow got molded into someone who likes playing with critical situations. Be it deadlines (not at work though.. have to say ... have to say..:P) or my daily chores. Secondly, its all about the pleasure one gets from the sudden and mountainous relief  through abundant pouring. I hope you understood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyways back to the track. The most interesting part follows. Each time i visit the "<em>relief camp</em>", i see am not alone. There is this whole bunch of varied group and thats when my thinking cells awake and start noting few things. Now let me blog down few of my notes:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
    <li>Usually the bunch refrain from the meeting each others eye sight. Each time they do, there is this sudden jerk of the neck, as if something exceedingly hot touched the eyeball, throwing the sights up or out.</li>
    <li>Most of the <em>campers</em> stare at the roof, either with eyes closed or 'blink'less. May be the roof falls in between. What they are staring is the heavens. Afterall what one attains is, indeed, a <em>divine pleasure</em>.</li>
    <li>There are those few who are relieved enough that they start bubbling at their mobile handsets, basked in the abundant relief.</li>
    <li>If there, incase, is no vacant one, mind clog with this NP hard problem of where to stand and where to stare. Few follow the route to WC, few stare in the mirror rubbing their faces, few pridefuls even walk back. There are also those few who, just unknowingly out of all the unbearabe tension, wash off there hands!</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now there are few more notes in my mindbook. But for now this is it. Need to totter along. Need to attain the pleasure. Here am off.</p>

			 <p style="text-align:justify;">What follows is just a prologue. If you want to directly hit my thoughts on me being superstitious, surf to the last line :)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A guy named <a title="B.F.Skinner" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.F._Skinner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B.F.Skinner</a> once carried out an experiment on pigeons to demonstrate the formation of superstition. He placed a series of hungry pigeons in a cage attached to an automatic mechanism that delivered food to the pigeon “at regular intervals with no reference whatsoever to the bird’s behavior.” His discovery in his own words:</p>
<blockquote>The bird behaves as if there were a causal relation between its behavior and the presentation of food, although such a relation is lacking. There are many analogies in human behavior. Rituals for changing one’s fortune at cards are good examples. A few accidental connections between a ritual and favorable consequences suffice to set up and maintain the behavior in spite of many unreinforced instances. The bowler who has released a ball down the alley but continues to behave as if she were controlling it by twisting and turning her arm and shoulder is another case in point. These behaviors have, of course, no real effect upon one’s luck or upon a ball half way down an alley, just as in the present case the food would appear as often if the pigeon did nothing — or, more strictly speaking, did something else.</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">More on this and its connection with me and my being superstitious <a title="Blabber Land" href="http://www.elatedamit.com/blabber/?p=6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

			 <p style="text-align:justify;">I always wanted to add my tweets to my blog, to pen in the sudden and randomly generated vibes in me. I use to do that at twitter. But i wanted to pull in the thoughts at one place. As i owned the place now, i thought of a dedicated section for the purpose and hence came into existence the &#8220;<a title="Blabber Land" href="http://www.elatedamit.com/blabber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blabber Land</a>&#8221;.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you follow the link, you can find the live demonstration of twitter in blog under the first section named &#8220;<em>Abrupt Blabberings</em>&#8221;. The procedure is pretty not-so-complex sorts. And with a simple but informative article like <a href="http://remysharp.com/2007/05/18/add-twitter-to-your-blog-step-by-step/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> your work is greatly reduced. Thanks Remy &#8230;</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">But still it would need a bit of a scripting and customizing on your part, for better results that is. Few points to remember (basically the ones i didn&#8217;t :P)</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;"><br /><li> Make sure you add the <em>&lt;div id=&#8221;twitter&#8221;&gt;</em> section at a proper place. Before pulling the tweets, book the place holder and test the looks with the dummy data. Customize the <em>div</em> section.</li><br /><li>Add the pre-fetch message at the blog. Let user know something is about to happen in the section. A progress indicator would be a plus.</li><br /><li>Now add the scipt that fills in the place holder booked earier i.e. the <em>&lt;div&gt;</em> section. Make sure you rename the <span class="embsrc"><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span class="str">tweet</span></span></em><span class="str"> in </span></span><em><span class="embsrc"><span class="pln">getTwitters</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">'tweet'</span><span class="pun">,</span></span></em><span class="embsrc"><span class="pun"> to the id you have mentioned in the <em>&lt;div&gt;</em> section above. So in this case, it should be renamed as &#8220;</span></span><span class="embsrc"><span class="pln">getTwitters</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">&#8217;</span></span><em>twitter</em><span class="embsrc"><span class="str">&#8217;</span><span class="pun">,&#8221;</span></span></li><br /><li><span class="embsrc"><span class="pun">Adding the script section towards the <em>&lt;/body&gt;</em> tag of your page would always be favorable. The simple reason being the browsers don&#8217;t start any parallel downloads i.e. of images etc as long as they don&#8217;t download the scripts. It is always recommended that scripts, wherever possible, should always come right at the end, after most of the page is completely loaded.<br /></span></span></li><br /></ol>

			 <p><a href="http://www.elatedamit.com/blabber/?p=6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9 alignleft" title="Superstition" src="http://www.elatedamit.com/blabber/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/ppooler_superstition1-219x300.jpg" alt="Superstition Cross your fingers" width="131" height="180" /></a><br /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yep that&#8217;s the way it is whenever you ask that renowned question to even <em>slenderly</em> educated guy. There is this eerie feeling in being superstitious. But i feel knowingly or unknowingly, we do follow superstition. Ok, lemme not talk about the universe for whole. Taaadaaa &#8230; I, myself, do follow superstition. Or lemme say i am the most superstitious guy among the people i know. No better proof than my following acts &#8230;</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;"><br /><li>I maintain my position for the whole match whenever india is winning a cricket match. Or whenever something, out of my control, is happeing in accordance with my wish.</li><br /><li>I try and change whatever i can when something is not betiding as i wish, to find out that right position to maintain (refer 1)</li><br /><li>As far as possible, i try and avoid &#8230; Uhhh &#8230; the path crossed by a cat. I know thats really foolish of me. But that is just to keep my mind away from any unwanted superstitious thought, if something bychance goes wrong.</li><br /><li>I have my own &#8220;<em>tasks-not-to-do-now</em>" list which i, by all possible means, avoid to carry out.</li><br /></ol>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ok, i will stop this whole self-bashing ceremony now. I know there would be pretty more. Will add them whenever am frustrated with myself. Anyways, I feel most of my superstitious acts are more of an attempt to prevent my mind from wandering in the dusty desert of superstition. You see if something does go wrong if i didn&#8217;t do __, at the back of my mind it keeps tinkering me, further adding to my superstitious feeling. That&#8217;s superstition to prevent increasing superstition.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">But i know whatever i say, i need to stop doing this. I need to stop falling to superstition just for the sake of not falling for the greater ones. I know .. I am working on that &#8230; Have already overcome few of mine. Blog on them soon &#8230;</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the way, i did find an interesting article. A guy named <a title="B.F.Skinner" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.F._Skinner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B.F.Skinner</a> carried out an experiment on pigeons to demonstrate the formation of superstition. He placed a series of hungry pigeons in a cage attached to an automatic mechanism that delivered food to the pigeon &#8220;at regular intervals with no reference whatsoever to the bird&#8217;s behavior.&#8221; His discovery in his own words:</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<blockquote style="text-align:justify;">The bird behaves as if there were a causal relation between its behavior and the presentation of food, although such a relation is lacking. There are many analogies in human behavior. Rituals for changing one&#8217;s fortune at cards are good examples. A few accidental connections between a ritual and favorable consequences suffice to set up and maintain the behavior in spite of many unreinforced instances. The bowler who has released a ball down the alley but continues to behave as if she were controlling it by twisting and turning her arm and shoulder is another case in point. These behaviors have, of course, no real effect upon one&#8217;s luck or upon a ball half way down an alley, just as in the present case the food would appear as often if the pigeon did nothing &#8212; or, more strictly speaking, did something else.</blockquote>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">So i guess i now know how it all started for me. I was ruined socially. Heres all my energy to end that &#8230; :)</p>

			 <p style="text-align:justify;">Finally i succeed. I have been working on this site for around a month now. I, though, had finalized my contents quite a long time back. But it was because of my random vibes, i could never really convince my mind for a dedicated hosted weblog. But finally&#8230;  Though am not sure is it a simple blog or a &#8216;<em>blogsite</em>&#8217;?</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyways this the first draft of the <em>site</em> i had in my mind for myself. I will note few points which, according to me, really heighten the user experience levels. It was all as a result of hours of skiing along the web and the constant feedback to myself of my experience as a user. So let me begin ..</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<ol><br /><li>More space for the actual content on the page</li><br /><li>Clear separators between two posts</li><br /><li>Easy on eyes font family and sizes</li><br /><li>Non-disturbing ads</li><br /><li>At hand list of recent post and comments</li><br /><li>No bulky colors</li><br /><li>Easily accessible links and catchy titles</li><br /><li>A consistency in the overall <em>site</em></li><br /></ol>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have thrived to please most of my expectations. Anyways i will, for now, not talk about my real journey right from &#8216;Blogger&#8217;, where it all started, to &#8216;Wordpress.com&#8217;, where it all beautified, to &#8216;Wordpress.org&#8217;, but just the final phase. The final shift, for me, was never a real pain in &#8230; uhh&#8230; <em>head</em>. And it shouldn&#8217;t be for anyone either. Only thing it requires is more of interest for designing and blogging.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it all started, once on a frustrated day, with research on the <strong>preprocess</strong>. Had to earn my domain name &#8216;<a href="http://www.elatedamit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">elatedamit</a>' which i did. Bought the domain at <a title="Rediff" href="http://hosting.rediff.com/hosting/scripts/HostingDomain.phtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rediff</a>. Few pitfalls, never ever search for the domain you are planning to buy. Especially never on <a href="http://www.godaddy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoDaddy</a>. The reason being various sites internally use GoDaddy for booking domains and, due to some random problem with their coding i guess, they are under impression you bought the domain even if you haven&#8217;t. Best example, <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Apps</a>.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moved to the host part. This was the most reasearched topic by me. I compared rates, providings, user experiences, expert comments and even overall look and speed of the hosting site itself. I really could not single out the best hosting site. Various people said, it depends on requirement. I feel the only thing it depends on is your luck. Choose, depending on how much you can spend, the best appearing host and leave it to luck. Hope that you won&#8217;t face any problem.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Roamed and jumped from <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dreamhost</a> to <a href="http://www.bluehost.com/tell_me_more.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluehost</a> to <a href="http://ewebguru.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eWebGuru</a>. But finally i stumbled upon <a href="http://www.lunarpages.com/basic-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lunarpages</a> based on the cost to feature analysis. I have hosted my blog with lunarpages for around a month now. I haven&#8217;t faced any issues of downtimes or slow responses yet. <em>One valuable and important suggestion. </em>Never complete the process right at the first time. Let them know you are interested. A guareented bargaining is about to happen.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once your domain and hosts are connected, what remains to do is limitless. Remove your age-old thinking cap. Upsurge your creativity buds and dive in the vast sea of designing <em>'blogsites</em>&#8217;. There is lots to learn and bit to earn too.</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">PS: Do let me know your views on the overall experience of the site. Let me confirm if  i am normal or has randomness caught my mind too :)</p>

			 <p style="text-align:justify;">Tired. Bored. Empty-Skulled. I gulped another cup of cappuccino. And on my way back, i just churned my head out to find why do i usually drink coffee/tea.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mentioned three properties are just few of the ones that make me amble towards the vending machine.  In reality, i feel i don't need any reason for supping coffee. Earlier it was to make sure, with sleepy patches of time curling over my head, i don't drivel down the office desk to the ground. But along my stroll through the professional life, the life itself mandated me to sip that muddy liquid each day on specified time. Now is the case that i feel tottery if i don't drink the coffee at the time prescribed by my life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I feel my life is getting hold of me. I feel it should be the other way round. I need to do something. I need to think. I need to drink a cup of coffee. But this time its non-prescrbed. Thats the start...</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Else the day won't be long when my situation would be as shown, with coffee howling "You used to gulp me because you wanted to. Stop gulping me because you have to"</p>

"Let me get the topic open" ...  "Yeahh... my N93" ... "Oh blog;  .. theme ... no..  blog .. title .. wait ..post ... " .. "Where the heck was I???? "</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ok so this is how my thought train has been when i thought i will write this post. And lemme say, this just acts as the 'POF' (Proof of Fact) for what i will be writing now. Let us get on the same platform first. This post (Will you please not follow the links directly and loose this topic..Thanks) was inspired partly by <a title="Unloading Information Overload" href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB121538872997031145.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> and <a title="Is Google Making Us Stupid?" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/google" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>. I hope you are still there with me. Because if you were not for some significant amount of time, thats what this post is all about. Reducing concentration levels... POF you see ...</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am pretty sure most of the so-called experienced internet surfers would have reached at this point far late than they would normally have. Because i have become one of those and i damn know that he would atleast have done few of following:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
    <li>Google for some random text (<em>Default</em>)</li>
    <li>Peeped into GTalk friends list</li>
    <li>Checked whether have received any new mail</li>
    <li>Checked if all social friends are up and running</li>
    <li>Followed into void via atleast 3 Links</li>
    <li>If yes for 3, Gave a thought and made a point for each one of them</li>
    <li>Oh ya .. paid some bill</li>
    <li>Rejected atleast a single credit card offer</li>
    <li>And oh ya .. worked :P</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I guess the list would build on n on. Anyways the point is surely you wouldn't have, if you have become one of us, read till now at a single strech. (I would really like to know what you indeed did. Put in the comments section. Hold on... Read completely first)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ok i won't try and find the reasons for why this is happening because that is not going to help me understand any damn thing. Let that job be left for some XYZ research group of companies. What i would actually try is provide some ways i can become a normal being from a 'skull-headed vaccum with rags of information' which am now. Let me start listing them down.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
    <li><strong>Update Google searh bar:</strong> I feel google can hugely impact a large sector of us concentration loosers. If only they ask for some not-so-privacy-threatning but self-embarrassing queries before returing the result. Lets say, "For how much hours have you worked today".</li>
    <li><strong>Redesign Operating Systems</strong>: Huge step i know. The one i would design is, i would say, mainly a build over on MS Vista. Ok , so you want switch program? Start. "<em>Do you really want to open ...? Yes/No</em>", "<em>Enter your Password ******</em>", "<em>Please re-enter the password ******</em>", "<em>Thank You! Please select the program you want to open. Enter the number in from of the selection</em>", "<em>Enter the text in captcha</em>", "<em>Thank you! Click Finish to open the program</em>" and finally "Y<em>our request to open ____ has been successfully served. OK/Back</em>" I am damn sure this will majorly kill the frequent ALT+TAB s</li>
    <li><strong>Introduce Sticky Books</strong>: Ok what if i want am not the comp junkie and still cherish the hardcopies? How can i be glued to the plot in the book? Fine. We will manually and physically do that for you. The books will be fitted with microprocessors programmed for secreting glues for defined time period which would be not less than 1 hour. You see. Its that simple.</li>
    <li><strong>Rename weekdays</strong>: Ok so point is inject a standard work schedule through out the human fraternity. Lets make each focus on a particular kind of job on the specified day. I would suggest let the week names be <em>Funday</em> (random fun), <em>Moneyday</em>(Money Matters), <em>Teamday</em>(Social Team Building), <em>Workday</em> (I know .. Boring Day), <em>Surfday</em>(Random Internet Surfing), <em>Reworkday</em>(Yeah .. 2 of them. Afterall thats what one is paid for) and <em>Saturday</em> (!!!!)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I know these options do sound rather ludicrous and more apparent changes like stop building multiprocessing processors or build 'one system one application' OSes might sound sensible. But then it is a "Build dam for water leaks" kinda solution. Anyways that's my foolish take on this not-so-foolish topic. Comment in your solutions, however foolish they may sound. Remember, there are many like you around you...</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally must say I have always been a workaholic enthusiast ... What remains now is just an -aholic enthusiast surfing endlessly in void.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>PS:</strong> If you have read this post in a single strech, i am damn sure you have just crumbled into wrong space. Click the back arrow button at the top-left corner of this window.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Update:</strong> Another interesting take on the same line. <a title="I am stupid and the internet made me so" href="http://www.sastwingees.org/2008/06/22/i-am-stupid-and-the-internet-made-me-so/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I am stupid and the Internet made me so</a></p>

			 <p>The title does sound, atleast for me, a bit self-boasting one. I dunno about others for whom &lsquo;being mysterious&rsquo; may quite well turn out to be &lsquo;yuck&rsquo;ish. (I know even my use of words sometimes is mysterious. You would surely have, if you have roamed round this blogosphere enough, come across many.)   <br /></p></p>
<p>Anyway mysteries has always kept on the edge of my seat. I have cherished even the worst of the mystery movies ever made. I even have a darn respect (!!!) for the makers of few of the movies, whose reason for existence itself was a mystery. Same goes for books or for TV shows. But more than anything else, what turn me on are the mysterious real life experiences. I have spend lots of my network bandwidth digging through the news stories about however foolish but mysterious incidences that happen around us. And it was this interest of mine that led to the existence of another blog of mine. <a href="http://mysteriesabode.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Realm of Mysteries</a></p>
<p><br />Along the journey there, I will keep on jotting few mysteries i, over the net, bump into. The stories may not be fully inclusive of all details as I have no intention to &lsquo;wikipedia&rsquo;ize the blog. Though they surely will provide required links for fully understanding them.</p>
<p><br />Let the journey begin &hellip;</p>

			 <p>All thanks to the most limited blog templates and still rather basic fuctionalities provided by &ldquo;Blogger&rdquo; , here I move to WordPress. I blocked my mind from entering into many territories where it always moved whenever i tried the shift. If i mention below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>My tacit devotion to Google products</li>
    <li>My concern about losing my Google Pagerank ( whatever it had earned in its prolonged stay at dusty Blogger)</li>
    <li>My concern for my randomly displayed 10-15 readers, i mean subscribers.</li>
    <li>AND one with foremost importance, My fear of unknown</li>
</ul>
<p>Overcoming all these today I finally made the shift. Won&rsquo;t forget to mention the great guide for people like me who are <a title="Best Practices" href="http://underscorebleach.net/jotsheet/2006/05/move-blogger-to-wordpress" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moving from Blogger to WordPress</a></p>

			 <div style="text-align:justify;">Finally I planned to blog today. I had been dropping quite a few shitty n weird ideas over notepad's bald head. But all thanks to my random weirdness, i flew far away from the thought lane and settled spending my complete time over choosing a blog template. Surprisingly, the decision to change the template was not a result of spontaneous wave of randomness. Rather it was with a thought that a simple and neat theme may load faster. (Not that i wanted not to loose the readers. What i wanted was not to make my readers loose there precious time pondering over what will load in.)<br /><br />So all the ideas still remain spread over notepad. From the day IPL has started, i have found <span style="font-style:italic;">no time for 'nothing'</span>. And as i could <span style="font-style:italic;">never</span> do <span style="font-style:italic;">nothing</span>, i could find <span style="font-style:italic;">no time for anything</span> but IPL. Hence i wish IPL ends soon so that i can get back to my state of <span style="font-style:italic;">nothingness</span> in the evenings. Then i would have ample time for doing '<span style="font-style:italic;">nothing</span>' so that i would be able to do many things.<br /><br />I know this post is of no sense at all. Still it does bring in an interesting thought to ponder over:<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">No time for 'nothing' means no time for anything</span><br /></div></div>

			 <div style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes few news stories do make me go mad. Some call them weird, some call them funny, some call them odd or even feverish at times, but for me, they make least sense with any tag you tie them with. But, however brainless it may sound, i am always on hunt for such stories at various loci (and as a result of that, i have this collection of all such <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/pipes/weird_funny">hotspots</a>). Blame it to my idiotic hobby of running random or to my faithful affection for going mad, i do look out for a chance, chance to turn mad.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Here's one such recent story. It seems that researchers have found out some weird <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080410/ap_on_fe_st/indonesia_lungless_frog">frog with no lungs</a>. No, I have no problem with them churning out so wondrous a finding. What my juvenile mind never understood was how these men of brain flooded with boundless wit carry out such humongous tasks. What was it that they have in them that any normal person didn't? And then this story rose, like a sage would from foggy nothingness, to content my ignorance.
<p>But before moving straight to the answer, let me take you through the line of thoughts my mutable mind followed along. A plain look at the title and it made me think &lsquo;Damn!! How on earth did they find that? Were they running around, scissors in hand, chopping each and every frog they cross, looking for their bloody bellies (<span style="font-style:italic;">pun intended</span>) for any abnormalities in them? And what did they think of as an answer they would provided to all those normal, but with a robbed sac like belly, frogs? Would a &ldquo;Hey sorry mate! We are searching for your deviant buddy. By the way, do contact a doc soon.&rdquo; do? Nah it won&rsquo;t. How can they be so irresponsible towards the nature. They indeed are answerable to the frog fraternity.&rsquo; Now i don&rsquo;t think this path is too abnormal. Any sensible one would have thought on the same lines. I felt mighty of myself for being so empathetic and felt<span style="font-weight:bold;"> that this needed to be blogged</span>. But that feeling wasn&rsquo;t there to last for long.</p>
<p>As i strolled through the story, the reality came into picture. The answer for &ldquo;what was it that they have&rdquo; earlier arose. It takes loads of  patience, time and prolonged interest for hitting something so uninteresting and so &ldquo;evolutionarily unique&rdquo;, as they call it, head-on. How else can you explain the fact that when the friends of this enlightened scientists were busy lurking  behind the materialistic pleasures, his majesty was busy searching for this mighty frog community, one of whose member he saw when he was 30 years younger. It required a mind full of unsatisfiable quests and determination not to find solution. How else would you explain the fact that once he did find one of them, he continued his quest to find 8 of their kinds and tore their lungless tummies apart before going &ldquo;EUREKA&rdquo;. I thought this answer that i mined was &lsquo;pen&rsquo;able and again felt<span style="font-weight:bold;"> that this needed to be blogged</span>.</p>
<p>I wish this was enough. But they went on to explain how their closest relatives had lungs and what that really means. Finally they didn&rsquo;t even forget to connect this with manly attempts to ruin the mother earth and a need to stop doing the same. Also a call at the end to protect earth from  facing this &ldquo;huge impact&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now all this was enough to make me feel <span style="font-weight:bold;">that this needed to be blogged</span>. And hence this attempt. Anyways now their&rsquo;s some other line my thoughts are following. It is after i saw few similar titles that read &ldquo;<a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/oddlyenough/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080404/ap_on_fe_st/odd_car_parts_theft">Man charged with theft left his son</a>&rdquo;,  &ldquo;<a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/oddlyenough/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080406/ap_on_re_us/odd_robbery_job_application">Robber left name on job application</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080408/ap_on_fe_st/odd_taxi_robbery">Suspect took cab to and from the bank he robbed</a>&rdquo;. Let me know your line of thought. I will post mine soon. Think&hellip; Think&hellip; Think&hellip;</div></p>

Each time i see the same old blog posts, i thought i need to motivate myself to start writing again. I tried everything. First thought of all the possible random, 'scribble'able points, came up with many and forgot about almost all of them, unpenned. I will note down the few still crawling in my volatile memory lane.<br /></div>
<ul style="text-align:justify;"><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">My well thought "to-be bad" predictions of where world will stand after, say, 20 years</span> (Hmmm motivation was a list of few predictions from biggies that went wrong. I think you need to predict harsh facts to be biggies. Doesn't matter if they go wrong. That will further elevate my predictions and in turn my biggie status.)</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">My untouched list of sources linkable to the Global Warming</span> (This topic is on my hot list. My only concern is i lose atleast one bullet point from the list with each passing day. No surprises, as the global warming topic itself is warmed more than the warming earth. I fear the debatable issues have more threat of extinction than earth)</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">My innovative ways to save our dear planet "earth"</span> (Save as in save from so called Global Warming. Not save as in save from getting thrown out of solar system. Though i don't want to post more of this, but few interesting questions did rise in my mind. If we threw Pluto out, where did the poor little chap go? Do the "Pluto" ions know that they are not the part of our solar system? Is our solar system their solar system or do they milk some other milky way? I guess i should stop here.)</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">My view of our universe</span> ("There was no big bang. There are no laws. There are no forces. There are no planets, no stars, no solar systems. There is no light. It's just HIM. Unrevealing this summer" Are you still expecting something more? Dude.. thats all you get in a "Teaser", you see :P)</li></ul>
<p>All of the above, though being pretty random, just couldn&rsquo;t motivate me. But as i was bluntly looking at my blog today, few striking facts about my previous post held my attention. First, my post was on Feb 14th, Mr.Valentine&rsquo;s &lsquo;some&rsquo;day. And topic was &ldquo;<a href="http://elatedamit.blogspot.com/2008/02/earn-security-but-at-price.html">Earn Security, but at a price&hellip;</a> &ldquo;. Though quite unintentional, but see what great sense it makes. Its this rosy day, that if you enjoy, you have to lose your liberty (control myself?? forget&hellip; ), equality (how dare one asks to be equal with the almighty partner), justice (when i know i have to agree that the person in front has to be right, whats the point asking for justice), freedom (what freedom can a criminal expect when he sentenced life imprisonment for himself). You do this and you sure will earn security, security for commitment. Just make sure you do burn your entirety.</p>

			 <div style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://elatedamit.blogspot.com/"><img style="float:right;cursor:pointer;margin:0 0 10px 10px;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/R6X8ZKKwL3I/AAAAAAAABKI/rgbNm4nZDmo/s200/gen1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Here is another slippery weekend sliding beneath my feet. As i sit acting idle, with feeling rather unsuccessful with my attempts to follow "<a href="http://elatedamit.blogspot.com/2008/01/operation-afraid.html">Operation Afraid</a>", i start scanning my social appearance at Orkut. (P.S. I did succeed in beating one dreaded task. Successfully washed the clothes, a task no less than a feat. Though the fear of uncompleteness did keep me away from taking a bath and shaving. You see victory ask for persistent efforts :P) And along my stroll, I  again dashed into a place i find the most meaningless. The Communities.<br /><br />I always thought that it should be wrong to say that i completely hate them. The fact that i myself have joined around 50 communities should signify that. But then it was today i thought to drill into my communities' choice. And then rose the truth. All the communities i have joined can largely be divided into following categories:<br /></div>
<ul style="text-align:justify;"><li>Ones i joined as a newbie, similar to a kiddie thrown into a toy shop picking random toys</li><li>Ones which i was forced to join with an ultimatum of sort "Join now" ('or you will be hanged alive' was always silent :P)</li><li>Ones wherein you just feel great to be part of. It hardly matters how much sense it makes in you joining them</li></ul>
<div style="text-align:justify;">And it was then i realized that communities are indeed quite a boring and meaningless places to be in. More meaningless than boring. Include one more of <span style="font-weight:bold;">ones which i created</span> and I guess we have the categories generic enough to include the whole 'orkut'ers. First, it hardly has any sensible activity going on. (One can surely not mark people proving themselves to be superior by posting last or naming there predecessor or playing jokers as sensible.) Secondly, thanks to the first point and the second and third category, it hardly reflects what the person's interest really are. So a weirdo playing a "Rate the person above you" game in C++ community places him straight into the third category just in for senseless fun.<br /><br />Moreover mostly are the occasions wherein the common interest projected itself is quite confusing. There are majority just to display one's liking for <span style="font-style:italic;">blah blah</span> singer, writer, director, actor, books, sports-persons, nations, places and every such namable entity. For each one mentioned above there is an anti-community of haters. Each one of these have various levels of followers: country wise, state wise, city wise, university wise and the digging just goes on. Then there are those which say they exists for common purpose like "spreading happiness", "cutting sorrows", "making healthy", "shit happens: you are not alone" and bhah blah. And finally those which are quite weird which do make you raise your eyebrows. Few to mention "I hate orkut" (wouldn't it be a good idea to group such interesting people in Facebook) or "Announce new orkut communities" (Community with a goal to promote other community?? how innovative) or "Absurd Communities" or "I hate orkut communities" (need i say anything??). How i wished to be innovative enough to come up with something so fascinating and new. No wonder each community has atleast a single copy with equal number of members.<br /><br />Anyways whatever i say, they do exists and exists with thunderous activities. I know i do have missed to crown many others which indeed need a mention. But then considering the vastness of this community world, i dare you try that out! </div>

If i was made dada, manu etc at home, each one followed that up by gawande, amit, amith (southernized), wasudeo (!!! thats my father's name. Isn't that ironic that it was called when i wanted it to be the least, while distributing the  checked answer sheets), strato, gaws and recently to few more.  I felt like a bot in quake3 arena getting named for each player. Yeah!! as if this wasn't enuf i myself tagged myself with "the great", "the warrior", "gaws", "gamer" and simply "the player" in gaming arena. But there was the one that kept following me and i dreaded the most. "Phattu" (meaning "the fearful". Quite interesting isn't it? I feared the name itself). Though i felt it wasn't fare enough, I feared the things every normal one did. And if someone didn't i always felt he should be called the fearfree (physo??? :P).<br /><br />Anyways today it was just by chance that i thought why not untie this tag from myself. But the first step was to list down the things i feel i fear the most in recent time. Because the countless times i was afraid is the past now and past hardly counts. So here goes the list of my recent 'fearmakers':<br /><br />1) <span style="font-weight:bold;">Weekends:</span> Yep. These dudes come with a promise to let me complete all my jobs i have been postponing to meet just to slide under my feet with a lighting speed keeping me awake every sunday night. And thats the night i go to sleep with mostly zilch completed. Few uncompleted jobs include random internet surfs, itemized jobs like meeting, following up with XYZ, completing uncompleted work over the weekdays, do some shopping, paying bills, calling someone and and... Uff the list really goes on. Few which always top the list and remain unbeaten include washing clothes and shaving. Its all because i keep fearing each one of them, i hardly take a bath on sunday. You see i hardly find any time. Facing the monday morning with every planned thing untouched shivers me up.<br />2) <span style="font-weight:bold;">News reports boasting someone:</span> It may seem its fully <span style="font-style:italic;">faltu</span> to fear something so stupid. But boss you should watch news channels catching random roaming people and making them comment on <span style="font-style:italic;">blah blah</span> attaining <span style="font-style:italic;">blah</span> feat. And then follow the unending murmurs: "East or West blah blah is best", "Blah blah is great", "we love u blah blah", "i feel in todays world .... hjhsdjsa.... sjdhsaj" (a sudden break from news reporter finally breaks his non-abating tempo). I fear heavily that one day it would be me who would end up on either side of the conversation: i mean either boasting someone or holding mic (Nah me getting boasted over a news channel seems hardly probable. Though the speed with which news channels are turning insane, the possibility cannot be negated. And believe me, that would be no less fearful)<br />3) <span style="font-weight:bold;">Reality shows and SMS:</span> I don't know if the show producers really know that but sending an SMS here at our place does get charged. But lemme be clear. No horror serial/movie isn't as horrifying as these shows. I really worry if i keep on watching the reality shows, time's not far when i would unknowingly type "&amp;*&amp;* A" or <span style="font-style:italic;">"LEAD #" and send that to 56789. Lines are open from saturday 10</span>.... Arggghhh You see the side-effect. It just sticks and stinks inside. And even unknowingly you start blabbering the rules. Now thats the fear.<br />4) <span style="font-weight:bold;">Google Homepage: </span>Seemingly harmless bot, this is the most dreadful thing among the lot. I myself feel am addicted to this dude now. After atleast every 1 hour of joblessness, I feel to face this faceless creature. I fear he would one day take over my mind one day and and spread his crawler bots to digg out the information hidden inside. The phrase (and widely used "About me" statement in social profiles) "My mind is an open book" would literally turn into "My mind is an open searchable entity. Just google it dude". Its really scary.<br /><br />I guess i should stop for now. Its the Sunday night, have just seen an episode of reality show, been targeted by the boasting news reports recently and just now ebbed myself my visiting google.com. So before I really get bogged down by fear, let me reveal the plan. Plan is i am going to not fear any of these things. Simple solutions is not watch television, no web surfing (surfing without googling??? Just can't imagine) and yep no work postponement. I know that's pretty 'new year resolutions'ish type of statements, but a start need to be made. Once i regain my control over these things, i will move to few other fearmakers. <span style="font-style:italic;">Till then good night. Its me signing off for tonight</span>.<span style="font-style:italic;"> Will meet next Sunday same time</span> .. Argghhhh need to sleep. Fearmakers on their way!!!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Update:</span>As if the "Google" fear i talked about earlier wasn't enough, there struck this video which intensified this fearmakers effect on my "blogged" mind. Thats quite creepy.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

			 <div style="text-align:justify;"><a>"</a>Give me a strip of laughter dose please."<br /><a><img style="float:right;cursor:pointer;margin:0 0 10px 10px;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/R1wk-72qBlI/AAAAAAAAA2c/uqKyBZEmZB0/s200/theater.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I know i do blabber pretty brainless sometimes. But then thats what comes to my mind whenever they yell "Laughter is the best medicine". So if thats the case, why pretend that its not sold in the medical stores? It is indeed sold by a lot of agents, with political leaders leading the race followed by the so called "Blah-Blah Rights Protection" buffs. Anyways thats not the purpose of this post's existence (Hmmm ... Interesting!!). Why this post lie here has its own insight.<br /><br />Along my stroll down the web's spider lane, I came across an article "<a href="http://ririanproject.com/2007/10/26/10-benefits-of-laughter-and-how-to-use-it/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;10 Benefits of Laughter, and How to Use It&quot;">10 Benefits of Laughter, and How to Use It</a>". Triggered my weird thoughts. As each point scanned under my eyes, my mind blogged through the idiotic wanderings. "Why"'s and "What if"'s started cracking under my skull. And the only way to abate that was to pen it down. So here goes the autopsy....<br /><br />Imagine a comment from a person something like "Buddy, i finally reduced the level of cortisol, epinephrine, adrenaline and dopamine man. Been long since i laughed." I mean may be thats true, but is there any need to know that? How does that matter which '-ol' or '-ine' i reduce. Really makes me think why do these dudes have to break down something simple like "Stress level" to all these '-ine's. Put it simple yaar. "Laughter reduces stress level" and one doesn't require any scientist to tell him that. Its instinctive.<br /><br />Plus they say laughter is a great workout. Okie, point taken. So from tomorrow onwards i will go to gym and break into a huge roar of laughter. Being highly contagious as they say, it won't take long to spread all through the company. Now come the two threads from Butterfly effect which my life can take.<br /></div>
<ul><li>It instills the positive mind frame in all the employees. And similarly all the city dwellers and finally to the whole country and then comes world. I win Noble prize for spreading happiness all around.<br /></li><li>Employees feel a complete physical release of tensions and all deadlines are forgotten. The behaviour spreads to the country and i am charged with contempt. I find the scientist who did this research and kill him. I am hanged.</li></ul>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Moreover a research suggests that optimistic (<span style="font-style:italic;">where's the connection with laughter dude?</span>) people live healthy and longer. Now thats obvious. An optimist would never say "I have got cancer buddy". Rather he would insist its a kind of a roller ball running round his stomach providing him guffaws. So never would you see him saying he is ill. Thats it. He is healthier for the world.<br /><br />Anyways fun apart, one point does hit the bull's eye. A smile costs absolutely nothing. So why not spread it on the face. I just wear it on and live on. Without really caring if it does benefit me or not. But one thing is for sure. It does spread some kind of freshness to one's mind and to the face.  So cut the crap buddy and spread the smile. <a href="http://elatedamit.blogspot.com/2007/05/talk-universal-language.html">It does make difference</a>!!!<br /></div>

Throughout my life, from a tender age when i was railing on my knees, I have never been a "Frutomaniac". I mean i have never been an idiotic fruits lover. When kiddies around me were busy drooling over all sorts of fruits, i was busy enjoying fats. Parents kept forcing me to push fruits in myself and i kept on running away making faces and crying like hell. And as always, the childish weeping bomb won over the parental force. And as i grew up, i was installed with an image for each fruit i was made to eat, forcibly. Follows the list (<span style="font-style:italic;">Don't expect this list to be exhaustive. If you do, stop eating fruits and go visit a doctor</span>)<br /></div>
<ul><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Custard Apple</span>: This is the one who i met earliest.  And as i visualize this guy, up stands the Tom Hanks from "Forrest Gump". Poor Chap who everybody just rips apart and relish. Hence goes my sympathies with this rusty.</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Orange</span>: This guy stands as one of the protagonists from any of the "American Pie" series. I mean he is all time dressed up just to get undressed. Capable of bring tears rolling down even with its peels. And a simple aim in life; lose his virginity (<span style="font-style:italic;">remember how you undress an orange with your thumb :P</span>)</li><li><font face="arial" size="2">Pomegranate</font>: Here come another rusty guy. But he is by no means the sympathy earning one. I mean, to start with, its no child's play to name and start relishing him. Even if you if do open him up, he starts poking his seeds in your tooth cavities; once his choco mate has played its part.</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Watermelon</span>: The chubby fat dumb a**. His black seeds depicting his face with pimples all over. As expected he has to be juicy. And its enough to drivel along your arms over your shirt. I never remember me <span style="font-style:italic;">mating </span>him with my shirt over.</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Mango</span>: The dude in the gang. Luck has always favored this guy unlike the poor custard apple. He is smart, he is rich, smells and tastes heaven. In short has all the qualities that can draw any female counter part in the fruit fraternity crazy. The news is he is dating <span style="font-weight:bold;">Banana </span>these days, you know that stripper round the corner. Yep the same fair chick ;)</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Apple</span>: And finally comes the most opportune guy among them all. Reasons unknown, this brat runs along every corner right from the mommy's kitchen (<span style="font-style:italic;">Apple pie, which is mostly without any 'apple'ish touch</span>) to the Doc's clinic (<span style="font-style:italic;">An Apple a day ... the real interpretation follows</span>). I mean he does hardly anything to earn fame. But sometimes its just divine providence and hence he earned the blog title too.</li></ul>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Thats just a small list of chaps who have significant thrust over my memory. There are many others like the ugly fat jackfruit or the sexy berries or the fearful grapes or the sleepy papaya. But then these don't stand enough ground.<br /><br />And before I end the post, lemme just clarify one thing. There is more as to why Apple earned the title here than just his fortune. For last few days, i have been made to eat apple daily claiming that "An apple a day keeps the doctor away". Its been just two weeks or so, and lemme assure you one thing. An apple a day does have guts enough to keep anyone away. Doc was just the poor guy who fell into the trap!!!<br /> </div>

Thats how work dawns at me<br /></li><li>Remain updated with my social contacts : Name sounds big. In simple words, i look at my un-updated profile again searching for new updates. Even a look at lame updates from friends would do<br /></li><li>Get coffee : Dude, it draws one fresh. Makes me totally ready for work</li><li>Start Working and keep working : Works always there boss. But all work can make one a turtle head in an office. So simultaneous tasks include keeping an eye on notifications from Outlook, Gtalk, feed readers, communicator, fellow workers and "hope they were my fellow workers" types. By the way, a basic click continues. Check mails and social networks!!!<br /></li><li>Lunch : Have to take it boss. Can't jump over it. I can give my 100% only when my tummy stays 100%.</li><li>Scribble about everything : "Why just aloo/paneer?" "Need a small nap yaar!!" "Boss i shouldn't have filled my tummy 100%. It really makes work difficult!!! [<span style="font-style:italic;">paradox???</span>]" "Oh wow.. Man I never get a chance to praise beauty. Is it me who choices the wrong places to fall in or its just my luck that throws me in??? [<span style="font-style:italic;">Men will be men ;)</span>]" <span style="font-style:italic;">And when i do think this is getting too out of work context, only the scribble context change</span> "Tomcat sucks big time man!!!" "Eclipse slows like damn dude" "Uhhh my system needs a dose buddy!!" And as this continues ...</li><li>Get Coffee : One has to get fed up. Nothing works in noon. Coffee has to make me fresh</li><li>Start Working and keep working : Work again. And stays the simultaneous threads. Just that an another thread with look at the clock gets added. And as EOD arrives...<br /></li><li>Check mails and Social Networks : I do it only twice. Once in the morning and again in the evening. Anyways no one mails. So why waste time checking mails. (An inner thought cries "Uhh still no mails.. no scraps")</li><li>Leave Office: I have a common statement to end my day daily "Today's was the worst day mate. Nothing worked yaar!!!" Scribbling continues.... </li></ul>
<div style="text-align:justify;">And as i end this post, an instant thought strikes. Does any software engineer spends a routine even an inch different than this one? Out comes the answer, obviously yes. Afterall every software engineer has new scribbles to scribble and new notification to look at. Also not everyone drinks coffee ....<br /><br />[<span style="font-style:italic;">PS: Though the above mentioned steps seem bulky, but they hardly take 5 % of my working time. Reasons are simple. I hardly get any checkable mails or replyable scraps or readable feeds. Moreover work does succeed to pull me in</span>]<br /><br />By the way, follows a nice video on juggling. It does provide another work synchronized thread, a look at "Buffering ..."<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

			 <div style="text-align: justify;">Another random crawl through the web brought me to this interesting fact. It seems it really is a big riddle to find a solution for. I mean look at the riddle. It does ring a bell for an ardent Hindi movie buff. (<span style="font-style: italic;">won't call it Bollywood!!! Though am not sure why, but as they say some things are better unexplained. May be a bit Patriotic feeling, which pops up every now and then). </span>
<p>A famous dialog from the movie &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072783/">Chupke Chupke</a>&rdquo; starring Dharmendra and Amitabh. &ldquo;<span style="font-style: italic;">Gende Ka Ful Ful Ho kar bhi ful kyun nahi hain?</span>&rdquo; starts guffawing into the ear.</p>
<p>By the way here goes the main story:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/16/2033951.htm">"A riddle: When is a kilogram that is no longer a kilogram still a kilogram?
<p>Answer: When the chunk of metal that serves as the official international standard for the kilogram, under triple lock-and-key in France since 1889, inexplicably sheds a little weight.Very little, though. The cylinder of platinum and iridium, sitting under three concentric glass bells like a metallic round of goat&rsquo;s cheese, is 50 micrograms lighter than the average of several dozen copies.&quot;</blockquote>

			 <div style="text-align:justify;">As a follow-up to an earlier post titled <a href="http://elatedamit.blogspot.com/2007/07/quality-confidus-for-softwares.html">'Quality Confidus'</a>, here goes another one. The theme for this was bubbling in my mind right from the day this lack of confidence for quality came to my notice. But the world is too full with nonsensical stuff to let you think about anything else. So this time round just closed my thought radar and blogged this post first.<br /><br /><a href="http://elatedamit.blogspot.com/2007/09/software-programmers-panico.html"><img style="display:block;text-align:right;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/RvTIsEYvvtI/AAAAAAAAAto/zdMndVNnG6A/s320/SP2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>So the story goes like this. This whole lack of confidence among the software programmers and managerial "<span style="font-style:italic;">stuff</span>" makes me wonder how really a programmers life is (Are managers really human? Am a bit skeptic about this fact. So let us call them stuff for now). I mean, thanks to this whole <span style="font-style:italic;">Bug-Raga</span> that rings in their ears day round, the time is not far when we may see a conversation sort as follows:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">SP2</span>: What the heck? Are you serious?<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">SP1:</span> Yeah man. I am really worried now. And confused too! Really i don't know how this happened<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">SP2:</span> Did you try resolving the issue. I mean try adding some stubs in code dude.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">SP1:</span> Did everything buddy. But its still the same. I don't know what will <span style="font-style:italic;">Emailo say. (Emailo is the manager 'stuff'. I hope it does ring some bells)</span><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">SP2:</span> Yeah. You have to work on this crisis. No one else can help and you know that. By the way what were you trying to do?<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">SP1:</span> See nothing complex of sort. I had to <span style="font-style:italic;">blah blah blah. </span>So what i did was i created a class extending <span style="font-style:italic;">blah</span> and implementing <span style="font-style:italic;">blah</span> with <span style="font-style:italic;">blah</span> method overridden. Then i created a static object for <span style="font-style:italic;">blah blah blah</span>.... <span style="font-style:italic;">(Thats what SP2 interpreted)</span><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">SP2:</span> Ya got that. Dude that indeed is not that complex <span style="font-style:italic;">(Thats called Geekology!!!). </span>I know you will resolve this soon. But lemme tell you one thing. You have to come out of this mess soon. Because <span style="font-style:italic;">Emailo</span> will think otherwise that you are not giving your 100% <span style="font-style:italic;">(Though everyone knows thats the truth. I mean if i give work 100%, how will social networking and IM's pull through).</span><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">SP1:</span> I know buddy.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">SP2:</span>  But i am still baffled yaar. <span style="font-weight:bold;">How can your Code run at the first go dude!</span> Thats completely unimaginable!!! I would just say try a bit of "<span style="font-weight:bold;">Re-bugging</span>". My best wishes are with you dude<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">SP1:</span> Thanks pal. By the way, do you know of any free downloadable "<span style="font-style:italic;">Rebuggers</span>"!!!<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">PS: Here though SP is supposed to stand for a "Software Programmer". But i feel there is another signifying expansion explaining condition of this Entity: Shoddy 'n Pitiable!!!<br /><br /></span><span>Thats <span style="font-weight:bold;">tagged</span> as: </span><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/humor" rel="tag">humor</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/programming" rel="tag">programming</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/software" rel="tag">software</a></div>

			 <div style="text-align:justify;">Been on watch for something interesting. And there came two strolling down. Its like asking for Halle and earning Serena and Venus together. But anyways as i have got them now, let me show some respect to both.<br /><br /><a href="http://elatedamit.blogspot.com/2007/09/global-warming-culprits-cows-and.html"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/RuQo-g9UOuI/AAAAAAAAAsc/AsRUfcibCrQ/s400/pigeons_goto.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>So crawling round the web I came across two interesting stories. Everything has to do with the mind blogging and ever growing <span style="font-style:italic;">globally warmed</span> issue(/fiasco??) of <span style="font-weight:bold;">global warming</span>. I feel scientist are too bored to pull out new points to discuss when everything has really been cut open. There are few great "<span style="font-style:italic;">humanophobic</span>"s who really are  after the human race to end themselves, so that there future generations can live long in peace (<span style="font-style:italic;">Quite weird huh. Where the heck will future generation fall from? As far as my knowledge goes, technology there with Souls hasn't reached the height to pull out humans from themselves. Or has it?</span> <a href="http://elatedamit.blogspot.com/2007/06/smoking-n-choking-out.html"><span style="font-style:italic;">Don't think so</span></a>). While there are other mankind lovers who just believe that we, the humans, can never trouble others (<span style="font-style:italic;">pretty optimistic boss</span>). So there go the stories possibly scripted by these mankind maniacs.<br /><br />Let us look at the first one. Its about the  <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/08/03/bridgetec_tec.html?category=technology&amp;guid=20070803140030" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">failed interstate bridge over the Mississippi River</a>. The inspectors believe that pigeons played a tantamount role in bringing it down along with heavy traffic, missing bolts and cracking steel. It seems these fatty pigeons out there in Mississippi go on and on shitting along the bridge, that too without wearing diapers, thinking it to be the government provided pigeon-open latrines. And its this <span style="font-weight:bold;">dung</span> that corroded the bridge and made it weaker killing tens. Chances are that this dung will kill many others at different locations. So its the pigeons who torture and trouble others and not the human. Man-kind maniacs score one. Catch the story here:<br /></div>
<ul><li><a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/08/23/pigeons_ani.html?category=technology&amp;guid=20070823134500"><span style="font-size:100%;"><span class="primeColor">Pigeon Dung: Menace to Bridges</span></span></a></li></ul>
<div style="text-align:justify;">The second story directly hits the bulls eye at global warming. Some scientists believe now that cows may act as the protagonists in the global warming saga. (<span style="font-style:italic;">Dude, are you bored with humans now. Or are you trying to cash on the fact that there are no scientists or bloggers in cow fraternity?</span>) It is believed that as a <span style="font-weight:bold;">cow burps</span>, she throws out the methane gas, a powerful greenhouse agent (<span style="font-style:italic;">this name always makes me jump in my seat. Those bloody gases have got quite interesting name. Lucky them!!!</span>). Have a look at the story:<br /></div>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0816/p13s01-sten.html">Lets make cows well mannered</a></li></ul>
<div style="text-align:justify;">If you go through the report closely, there is one thing that will amaze every sensible man. And it is present in any report these days. Look at the <span style="font-style:italic;">height of depth</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">crazy isn't it???</span>) the statistics go. 100 gallons of methane per cow per day and so on. Am really skeptic as to how they dig this data out. I mean, dude, 1 burp each 40 seconds? Uhhh give me a break.<br /><br />Anyways these stories may seem rather amusing and ludicrous. But they can affect the lives of these two cow-pigeon fraternity. Think how would be the environment out there among these poor buddies. And as i become a bit time-filled brat again, i surely will.<br /><br />Thats <span style="font-weight:bold;">tagged </span>as: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/global+warming" rel="tag">global warming</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/humor" rel="tag">humor</a><br /></div>

			 <div style="text-align:justify;">Been "off-post" for quite a long time now. Spent some heavily burdensome days for the last month or so. Really felt it was like a CD crash at a <span style="font-style:italic;">perfect</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">best </span>scene you have been drooling for. Anyways a nice break at home and am back to normal. Hopefully there are no crashes so forth.<br /><br />This post is warm-up swing. Had lots of ideas bubbling around, but just couldn't manage to pen them down. Wish i had the Dumbledore's <span style="font-style:italic;">random magical pensive</span> so that i could just stroll down the memory lane and pick up the thought pebbles (<span style="font-style:italic;">though truly speaking i couldn't visualized that silvery stuff as something from brain. Ya, my nose did give a jerk on its reference</span>). So back to the post from my slippery (!!!) thoughts, following is my attempt to bring  out how indeed the independence day holiday is celebrated. My degree of independence on the day was surely not one to be rejoiced. That pain was enough to bring out this abnormal print out.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">P.S.: I know this damn is not  readable, virtually i mean. Just click it to zoom in. Hope it gets readable, not just virtually :D</span><br /></div>

			 <div style="text-align:justify;">There has always been this indelible discussion to find out what makes all these successful corporates and biggies attain the status they hold. Be it Google, Apple, Ubuntu or Microsoft. One question would be why just these four? I would say they lead where they are. Anyways a general consensus is formed over work ethics and culture and innovation and customer satisfaction and <span style="font-style:italic;">blah blah blah</span>. But I feel the reason lies somewhere in the <span style="font-style:italic;">logo</span> they hold. I thought if that was really the case, then one can surely see a statement from each of these biggies as follows:<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/Rqbl3De4H1I/AAAAAAAAApE/1tEoYEUV8ow/s1600-h/google.jpg.gif"><img style="float:right;cursor:pointer;margin:0 0 10px 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/Rqbl3De4H1I/AAAAAAAAApE/1tEoYEUV8ow/s320/google.jpg.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="font-weight:bold;">Google</span>: "Dude logos are important. We have a special group assigned for that. Moreover there is a daily 2% 'Logo time' for each employee. Look at our color combination. Look at its display. Look how we repeat the colors. Look how letters flow. Look at their inclinations. Buddy, thats the secret behind our success."<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/RqbqAze4H4I/AAAAAAAAApc/zzSwdn6P6SM/s1600-h/iphone-logo.jpg"><img style="float:left;cursor:pointer;margin:0 10px 10px 0;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/RqbqAze4H4I/AAAAAAAAApc/zzSwdn6P6SM/s320/iphone-logo.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="font-weight:bold;">Apple </span>(after iPhone): "Obviously man. Do you think we don't take logos seriously. We spend millions of dollars over deciding what colors to choose, what shape to choose. Look at our logo. See the shape of the apple, the leaf. Look how just a single bite is out of that", <span style="font-style:italic;">with more of a sadistic smile</span> "as if ready to eat Microsoft up. Buddy, thats the secret behind our success."<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/RqbqJDe4H5I/AAAAAAAAApk/pqii4sOZNlw/s1600-h/ubuntu.jpg"><img style="float:right;cursor:pointer;margin:0 0 10px 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/RqbqJDe4H5I/AAAAAAAAApk/pqii4sOZNlw/s200/ubuntu.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="font-weight:bold;">Ubuntu</span>: "Boss, do you think we are mad to neglect importance of logos? We build our softwares afterward. First thing is to decide upon the logo. We make each member of open source community to come up with his own version and select best through voting.  Look at the delicate design formed. Look at the font used. Look at the curves. Buddy, thats the secret behind our success."<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/RqbrXDe4H8I/AAAAAAAAAp8/DbTBHVr15bo/s1600-h/vista.jpg"><img style="float:left;cursor:pointer;margin:0 10px 10px 0;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/RqbrXDe4H8I/AAAAAAAAAp8/DbTBHVr15bo/s200/vista.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="font-weight:bold;">Microsoft </span>(after Vista): "Obviously man.

But whatever you are saying is a simple amalgamation of what Google, Apple and Ubuntu say. That is a copy from different sources."<br /><br />In comes the reply from Microsoft guy, <span style="font-style:italic;">in the coolest possible way</span>: "Buddy, thats the secret behind our success."<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">[PS: The above situation is completely a virtual (truth).

Truly speaking not something amazingly mind blogging<span style="font-style:italic;">. </span>But I just kept scratching my bum over searching for the right word which i hardly could. So just replaced it with something <span style="font-style:italic;">sensefull</span> and thought who cares. After all thats how new words are born and as an ardent user of English language its my even responsibility to add to its vast sea of gibberishes.<br /></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><br />Ahh so backing to the topic, recently i heard about this<span style="font-weight:bold;"> CMM5 quality guru</span> and an incident that happened with him. Forgive me I am bad at remembering the names. But anyways how does that really matter what you call him. In my senses lets say Mr D . This supposedly techie guy used to resurrect the importance of quality in software projects.  It so happened that D had this kiddish habit of forcing his listeners into some situations and then try screw them when they answer. However this time around he promoted himself to a sadistic charm. He had a group of project leads as his listeners. Yawny as they always are,  Mr D put them into a bit of critical situation. Here goes the conversation, obviously a spicy virtual one:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Mr D:</span> Suppose you are boarding an aircraft which is a fully high tech one with Auto Pilot system, lights running all around, virtual air hostesses of shape and size of your choices. But the catch here is the whole software running is developed by your project group. There are no parachutes or any kind of emergency exit system. So in case your software fails, you rest in peace in your cosy container. Choice is yours; board the plane or pain your board.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Leads by now were pulled back to their senses. Seeing there life at stake, everyone hesitated to even walk in the aircraft. Their minds were running on a track somewhat as: "What the heck. Dude am least comfortable with aircrafts running with software developed by these geeks under me. Who knows these bastards left some untied piece inside. I don't understand a shit and they don't give a damn." Actually speaking, Mr D was bubbling inside as this was his chance of scoring goal on quality. But suddenly a hand rose. Not only D but every single 'D'umbo inside was shocked.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Mr D:</span> Buddy lemme get it clear. Is it some kind of joke or you really are that confident. Dude this isn't something what i expected. Tell me how are you so confident with your team. What do you run for so much quality control. Speak up before everyone leaves this room and rush to book a call with you.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The One</span><span style="font-style:italic;">(cool and yawny as always)</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">: </span>Cool down man. Am least worried to board the aircraft. And I know nothing is gonna happen to me.  Rather I am not gonna go anywhere. Just for the simple reason that if the aircraft is build by my team, it can never take off. Engines would never kick off."<br /><br />Just a midget silence and the whole room roared up into a huge burst of laughter. It got virtually transfered to a ball room where no one except performer cares how he perform. Mr D needed hardly anything to prove his point.<br /><br />This whole lack of quality confidus (got something to do with confidence, but i though thats not the perfect word ;) may rise to a level which would lead to a new breed of IT conversations. I am dressing it up. It would rise soon. Something by the name: Programmer's Panico !!! Do hook up.<br /></div>

But as i tried searching for a reference for the behavior, the efforts didn't throw success.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/Ro5PTSSuwNI/AAAAAAAAAog/KLQp1wKmb6g/s1600-h/gen.jpg"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/Ro5PTSSuwNI/AAAAAAAAAog/KLQp1wKmb6g/s320/gen.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>However, the story doesn't end at this stage.  When I tried to playback the same in Internet Explorer, I was stunned to see no such behavior. So thinking that this has to do something with Firefox, I tried scanning other search engines for the display of time stamp, nothing really happen. So bulged a question. Is this behavior related with Google searches in Firefox? If so, whats so different in Firefox than IE? Moreover I am using the latest updated versions of both. I even tested it on a fresh version of Firefox. So i assumed it has least to do with mozilla extensions.<br /><br />As if these questions weren't enough, something more happened that assisted the assumptions. As i deleted the cookies, I wasn't that <span style="font-style:italic;">hoo-haa </span>seeing no stamp. But what baffled me was I was unable to redraw the same behavior.<br /><br />So another question popped up in my mind. Does Google have some playing hours on internet, when they just put in some behavior into there search and pop it out as soon as they test it? Mozilla couldn't do that because thats something that resides on my system. And if it does put something without my consent, I see some good time ahead of me. Anyways currently I have employed myself to demystify this abruptness.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Update: </span>One thought each one gets first is about add-ons in mozilla. But as i mentioned, I tested it out with a fresh version of firefox without any extensions too. So addons have zilch part to play. Moreover the abrupt display and hiding of the time stamp continues now too.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Update2:</span> After a lot of trial and errors and with the help of a very useful comment by <span style="font-style:italic;">whoblah</span>, i was able to understand the behavior. Rather i shouldn't call it a mystery as it really wasn't. It was just an ignorance on my part. Thought let me reveal the solution because there is possibility that there would be many others ignorant enough. In nutshell, the issue has to do with Google's web history, where in for the above behavior to work, one needs to be logged into his Google account. If you are, you can see the complete history about when and how many times have you opened a particular link from Google search. So don't panic if you ever see a time stamp next to the search. Thats Google history at work!!!<br /></div></div></div>

One sits at his desk, gazing at his clock arms strolling round its face. Just when he is completely down; about to dream his imaginations, a sudden buzz of <span style="font-style:italic;">"Hi"</span> rises at the south-east end of his desktop. A smile props up at his face thinking <span style="font-style:italic;">'Thanks buddy for a bit of relief'</span>.  And suddenly something happens and he, the savior, is gone with his work done. You sit there stunned, trying to grasp what really stormed out. But plain abortive attempts! Incidents like these have happened with me many times now. Just another similar incident and i thought there is an exigent need to decrypt what the incoming messages really mean. So here i am penning down meanings of just a few abrupt messages which i have been decoding for quite sometime now ...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">HI (all caps)</span> -  <span style="font-style:italic;">"Look here u idiot... am too busy unlike u"</span><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">hi </span>-<span style="font-style:italic;"> "am bored like hell ... and its a command u should talk to me. Anyways everyone knows how much work           you do .... lol!!!"</span><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">hi ... rut </span>or <span style="font-weight:bold;">u there</span>- <span style="font-style:italic;">"reply soon u dumb... am in hurry and have some important work for you"</span><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">what's up</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> </span><span>or</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">kya chal raha hain</span> - "i am least interested in what you reply, but for formality. and even i know your answer is going to be the same ... 'am fine' "</span><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">thankxx</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> - "am done with my work .... don't expect any more messages after this"</span><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">uhhhh</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> - "go to hell"</span><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">hhahha</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> - "buddy i have to run ... ok ok .. that was good ... stop it for haven's sake now"</span><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">hmmmm</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> - "my mind's empty now boss ... have nothing sensible to say.. "</span><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">ok ok bye</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> - "thats the last statement from me dude. nothing here after; even if u keep shouting your stomach out"</span><br /><span><span style="font-weight:bold;">abe sun</span></span><span style="font-style:italic;"> </span><span><span style="font-weight:bold;">%$%^*</span></span><span style="font-style:italic;"> - usual entry statement by a member of <a href="http://randombots.googlepages.com/">RandomBots</a></span><br /><br /><span>These are just a few messages which i was somehow able to demystify. May be not always do they convey the same meaning as stated. But then it goes for any decoded stuff boss. It's meaning is not always what it is decoded as. However, there are many others which are enthusiastically popping to get naked. But they just keep fluctuating there meanings even more often than <a href="http://elatedamit.blogspot.com/search/label/Bat%20n%20Ball">Sachin Tendulkar</a>'s form. I am working part-time to decrypt those. Truly speaking, without really getting paid. Or am I? ;)</span><br /></div>

Walking even though you own a car? Use Recycle Bags? Switch to a small cars from SUV's?<br /><br />I have heard all these things a zillion times now. After all, the only answer my mind shouted was "Buddy, how does that matter. World's not worried, let me be imperturbable on this too." But then thought there are tons of other things i do perfunctory. To what extent does my following these things going to affect me. Not much really. So ... Anyways what is this carbon footprint and why the damn i should care? Why Singapore is looked after as a place following well thought solutions? <a href="http://www.ibnlive.com/videos/42284/special-citizens-for-earth--be-one.html">IBN</a> does try and provide answers for these.<br /><br />Indeed what the video tries to convey does seem quite convincing. But just when I was about to bend my mind to digest this all, I was struck with a thought. I wondered are we, the humans, only protagonists in the so called global warming saga? Does CO2 emission by human have a significant threat to our environment? Is there any such global warming threat being seen? Are predictions of climate change perfect and not a mere prejudice?  Is it proved by experts that we are causing global warming? Is global warming really that bad? Will the money-gulping efforts to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions really stop climate from changing? Further, aren't they just bursting the state's budget? Rather, shouldn't money be flowing towards perennial and  pernicious threats? An <a href="http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=11548">article published in <span style="font-style:italic;">heartlander</span></a> does try and provide an answer to these all. What it concludes is to follow the call to the common sense and just put this "Global Warming" Scam to end.<br /><br />Further the movie below tries and put this whole saga under the name "<span style="font-weight:bold;">a vested political interest creating panic</span>" to turn more money towards climate science. CO2 indeed has very little to do with the climate change. I do feel even this view of scientists at other side of this scam needs to be looked at before we go and follow the call for morality.<br /><br /><br /><br />Then what is the path for me to follow? At the end, I find just trapped in yet another polemic. Unable to figure out, which way to lead myself!!!<br /></div>

			 <p align="justify">"Howdy"!!! ... Thats how i was welcomed to the Wordpress' blogosphere. Frankly speaking, i got little freaked. Buddy, why this 'too-dudishness' ? Anyways, this blog of mine was more due to my urge to try out new options for what i already own (however, the urge doesn't show up for each thing i own). Backing to track, let blogger's eyes view wordpress....</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"> Yes, wordpress looks, or rather, is more organized than blogger. Nice options to manage one's space. Vision smoothening look. No Doubt, Ajax has worked hard to dress it up so well. Nice presentation choices including few elegant templates and useful widgets. Facility to create more than one pages. I did find this option interesting for it allows one to virtually transfer the blog into his website. Import and Export of posts and widgets. One's own uploading space. And last but not the least, a complete stat-pack providing all the required information about the reader and feed traffic on the blog. Yes, no need for all the foolish external widgets for tracking. Wish google understands this need of a blogger.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">But wait .... Hey, a bad editor and worst saving option. Am writing this part again when i already did it. Thanks to a you, Mr editor. Further, i feel these options are too many to for a novice to get hold of. And again, google scores where it always does. User Friendliness. Google knows what i want and where i want that. No wonder, blogging starts with Blogger. To illustrate, a user has to struggle here just to get his image inlined in his post. The reason why am writing this again with some weirdly placed images. Cudn't find any? Yeah i removed them for the weirdness they were incorporating in the post.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">To pack up, wordpress is a beautiful and elegantly designed blogger tool. But blogging is not as easy as compared to Blogger. Anyways, wish to put this space of mine to some use. Currently surfing my mind to reasonify this blog!!!</p>

			 <p><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Time:</span> 6:55 am  <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Venue:</span> Koramangala Bus Stop<br /></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><br />It was a silent morning one can often confront in Bangalore, just before it bursts into its raw-dusty look. For me though, the silentness was pouring further dubiety in my already crowded mind. Crowded indeed it was, with anxiety n excitement n tons of questions. About to emerge was my first day in employee world; another significant turn in my life. And then there was that sudden roar. Silentness just boomed. In the park behind were few ages' bubbling with laughter, leaping and clinging each other, everyone trying his best to outdo everyone else. I could see dawn getting outrageous, looking at its lost soundlessness; like a gritty kid who has been denied a toy. Stood in front of me, a laughter club. Frankly speaking, i did find the whole raga rather funny. Each person trying to trouble oneself and catch one's breath. But little did i know what they were trying, was to change the world.<br /><br />The incident rose before me just a few days back when i learnt that as i was yawning in my bed at "not-so-dawny" time, there were few people who were celebrating a "World Laughter Day" on 6th May. Thought why not know something about this chapter in "blah blah Day's" Saga. What i found were many views on how laughter scientifically, spiritually, socially can make a person, and thus the world around him, better. Each view was clear enough to subscribe one to the thoughts.<br /><br /></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.laughteryoga.org/world-laughter-day.php"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_12OSnRKdLTQ/RkLI3kw7cNI/AAAAAAAAAG8/lp-XoKyIgME/s320/WLD-small.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>A question may arise why this sudden<span style="font-style:italic;"> gyan</span> on laughter. Even i don't know the answer. But one thing needs to be marked. Do laugh off some part of your day. In fact, there is something happening deep inside you; fighting to make you better. And there are few who do believe you are <span style="font-weight:bold;">thus</span> adding to the world peace. So don't wonder if you face a bang on first Sunday of May. Just note its those few talking a universal language. Over-ambitiously!!!<br /><br /><div style="text-align:justify;">Anyways, follows a nice song "Sadho Re" by band <span style="font-style:italic;">Agnee</span> (First <span style="font-style:italic;">Jal</span>, Then <span style="font-style:italic;">Raeth</span> and now this one. I feel <span style="font-style:italic;">Yavu</span> is on its way). A striking song with beautiful lyrics. Why i place it here? I would say it speaks out today's world's unrest; which makes this peace-talk further important.<br /></div></div>

I know these are the answers unquestioned, but my mind said, at least for me, these are questions unanswered too.<br /></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><br />1) <span style="font-weight:bold;">Greenview, </span>a hospital in Jakassandra area, was named so because of the view a person sees when he peeps out of a window, irrespective of the side he is on. In the front, a dark green gutter with water bubbling and scenting its way forward, welcomes him. Behind he sees a rock solid demented garbage. Numerous occasions has BMC tried to move it, but thanks to its insane determination, the garbage continues to zero all the BMC's efforts. Either sides provide a deserted plot, green as they are, all credit to the numerous organisms decomposing 'em off. So thanks to the hospital management's endeavors, patients have something to <span style="font-style:italic;">green </span>about. Finally, thats what he requires the most.<br /><br />2) A shop-keeper on Hosur road has his shop named *7%^&amp; (<span style="font-style:italic;">this is something in Kannada, so couldn't understand that. A humble call, not to be misinterpreted with its usual meaning :D</span>) <span style="font-weight:bold;">Tnasportions</span>. I feel, he just wanted to make it clear what his shop was about. Because he felt not everyone can make sense of something in Kannada. But English, boss its a universal language. I am still waiting to see it unclosed one day. Curious as i am about his work.<br /><br />3) Auto and truck drivers are really eager to know how a person following him looks; does he deserve following him or not. So a simple solution they found was to write "Stop" at their bum. Now, dignified persons as they are, they face a problem. After all, who likes others staring at their posterior. So what they do is just add an "OK" tag to tell, "Enough gazing my rear boss."<br /><br />Enough answering unquestioned questions. There are few more answers waiting to burst out of my mind. But as of now, I am busy slanting my mind to digest these first.<br /></div>

On numerous occasions have i seen the politicians using the law at their own will. Heating and bashing the law suits, molding them and coining as much money as possible. It doesn't matter even if they stroll over fortunes of thousands. The week saw two decisions taken by SC which do pour water on their motives. Quota dispute and the cauvery row have been the most vexed issues for some time. Cauvery issue though not that significant nation-wide, but i did find the verdict as really interesting. Honest disclosure, am not here to pass my judgment  over the issues. But really could not hold myself from lauding the SC's respective benches.<br /><br />Quota dispute has been one of the hottest topic of discussions over the last one year. The year saw huge rallies, protests and discussions among "so-called" leaders presenting (or rather forcing) their views. Nebulous were the intentions of the political parties; the restlessness of thousands of the youths following them, with a hope to get some respite. What was rather clear was that the decision cannot and should not be taken with 75 year old data as yardstick. And thats what SC acquainted and slapped Center Government to "determine who <span><span class="f12">is socially and economically backward". OBC quota gets a stay order, with aspiring students getting a bit of relief. Observation of the bench was "</span></span><span><span class="f12">Reservation cannot be permanent and appear to perpetuate backwardness". </span></span><span><span class="f12">Harsh </span></span><span><span class="f12">though</span></span><span><span class="f12">, but true to the core. </span></span><span><span class="f12">What I further fancied was the SC's verdict for center's plea to vacate the stay order. Slammed was the government "to stop playing the game first and then framing the rules". This was a proper slap to the self-centered politicians trying to cash the issue during the elections. Way to go, Division Bench!!!</span></span><br /><br /><span><span class="f12">Cauvery verdict has also seen huge protests in the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu post HC decision. SC passed a verdict asking CM's of the two states to show some "Statesmanship". A simple reason was stated that "any order passed is bound to trigger protests in the aggrieved </span></span><span><span class="f12">states". </span></span><span><span class="f12">Not only have the bench members refrained from deciding the fortune of the debated dispute but also provided an option to confront the nation wide water-scarcity issue. Hope the "Statesmen" do understand the humble intentions.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span class="f12">Both the verdicts are indeed wake-up calls for the politicians. But what i fear is that the problem is still far away from being solved. Center's not ready to give up the quota issue so easily, eying the elections. IIMs are still not clear on how to carry the admission process forward. Students stand midway, confused, staring at their hazy future. Our politicians are engrossed completely in debating what literally statesmanship is. And We, the mute and deaf people, are  busy blabbering and listening to our Mp3's. Paradoxical Indeed!!!</span></span><br /></div>

Thats how today's incident caught me. Really felt am i missing something? Am i really enjoying my life? Corporate world has indeed made me dry. Juiceless. Deprived of whatever fun element I had in my life. Saw the wetted earth today and there loomed the childhood days in front of me.<br /></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;" class="MsoNormal"><br />Those hours I spent sitting on a sofa employing my eyes out at rain beaten roads. "Chai-Bhajji" or "Pohe" that i relished. Slightest sound of a rain drop that made me run towards the porch. Spellbound eyes of mine that tried to gulp up a sight of lush green fields. An enchanting effect that even a midget breeze created. The restlessness that a sight of river or even a small stream gave me. The dew-laden grass plates that endorsed the mesmerizing capacity of the nature. "Aai" who always dabbed me forcefully in the sweater and monkey-cap. Soothing effect that the cooler-chilled room created after returning from burning heat. Glasses of Rasna i gobbled. Waits for the "Chachaji-Sabu-Raka" Combo. Exchanges of comics and greedily moving through the pages, just to make sure we read the most. Carrom Games, Cards, Cricket matches that we played, ignorant of screeching sun, blowing winter or pouring rains. Dirty clothes that i washed so as to keep "aai" unaware of mud-ridden football matches. And the list just goes on, endless. I never knew what really allured me so strongly. But I do was.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" class="MsoNormal"><br /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" class="MsoNormal">And today, here I am looking at the rain-hit porch from my AC cubical. Without a sofa, "Pohe"or "Chai Bhajji". Drops kept pouring, waiting for me to run into the porch. Lush-green lawn's spread out there, just to make me spellbound again. Gone are the rivers/streams and am in the middle of bulk of fountains. But these don't make me restless. "Aai Daddy" are there, always at the other end of phone line. Mirinda can't take the place rasna holds. Dan Brown or Sidney Sheldon can't surrogate "Raj or Diamond". "Batman-Superman" can easily be kneeled down by "Druv-Nagraj". Gone are the games. Gone are the friends. Gone are the fun-filled days. Nature's still out there. Calling me. Waiting to mesmerize me. With me completely oblivious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" class="MsoNormal"><br /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" class="MsoNormal">Thanks a lot, corporate world. Thanks a lot!!!<br /></p>

			 <div style="text-align:justify;">Numerous occasions already behind, here am again making a resolution.... No Cricket!!! Thanks to another dismal performance from so-called best Indian team playing cricket so far. Don't wanna discuss about that horrible night. Almost played the match y'day, virtually though, with those great men, just to have yet another sleepless night. Uhhh .... thats it. Why am i discussing that. No Cricket... "Cricket"... What?<br /><br />Oh, there's a match today... a good one. I guess, resolutions are better started on Sunday. So lets wait for a day. No Cricket.. from "TOMORROW" :P</div>

But these are not demands for victory, nor the expectations that come from thinly veiled jealousy over how much money India's cricketers make. Instead, this is a call to a skilful and talented bunch of individuals to do what they do best. It is a cry for the class of 2007 to reduce cricket to what it is really about - bat and ball. Only that can heal the soul of a game that's been thrown into torment. Only that can give India the best chance of winning and, in the event that they do not, lend strength to the calls for restraint that will inevitably follow."<br /><br />-By Anand Vasu<br />(For complete story visit: <a href="http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/ci/content/current/story/286790.html">India's biggest battle will be in the mind</a>)</div>

			 <div style="text-align:justify;">Utterly ready to start my trip to pune, the unstable mind, as usual, was not able to stick to a plan for the day. Breakfast first or office first? Where? What to have? What about the lunch? Lunch or just snacks? Questions started blogging my mind. Finally stabling down to a bakery, had a samosa   and gave away whatever change I had (again with unstability, shall I or shall I not). Completely oblivious of what's in store next, I hired an auto with just 100's and 500's with me. Finally was caught up in a "not-so-dissimilar" situation. Started the usual cry. "Sir, change do. Itne sabere hum kahan se layenge change. Tumko malum hona. Samajhta nahi kya".<br /><br />I know i did do a mistake by not keeping the change with me, but what i didn't know was i did a blunder by not knowing that 10 bucks are considered as change. He was calling me a fool and i had no choice but to accept silently  that i am one. Then I thought thats not a big deal. Not him, then someone else would have fooled me out. So simply nodding in acceptance for what he said, I just  walked off. A thought just scribbled my mind, days are not far when a man will be called a fool for giving beggar a 10 rupee note.  For "Chutta" would have its value raised, with 10 bucks no longer being considered as change. A "Beggar's delight" or rather "Beggar's dismay"? Random thought though, but unanswered.<br /></div>

Feeling really confused, I try and get my thoughts cleared; but just to get confused further. Same thing happened today. Worried about what to google, I tried to get my doubts, on how I need to proceed, cleared. After a head banging sequence of questions and answers with..... (how does that matter)....

			 <div style="text-align:justify;">This is the original poem written by Ram Prasad Bismil, when he was in Jail...
<p>Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamaray dil meiN hai,
dekhna hai zor kitna baazuay qaatil meiN hai
karta nahiN kyuN doosra kuch baat cheet,
dekhta hun maiN jise voh chup teri mehfil meiN hai
ay shaheed-e-mulk-o-millat main teray oopar nisaar,
ab teri himmat ka charcha ghair ki mehfil meiN hai
waqt aanay dey bata deNge tujhe ay aasmaN,
ham abhi se kya batayeN kya hamare dil mein hai
khainch kar layee hai sab ko qatl honay ki ummeed,
aashiqoN ka aaj jumghat koocha-e-qaatil meiN hai</p>
<p><strong>Updated:</strong> To my surprise, i came to know that that’s not all that it has to say.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Follows the complete bismil poem:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamaare dil mein hai
Dekhna hai zor kitna baazu-e-qaatil mein hai
<p style="text-align:justify;">aye watan Karta nahin kyun doosra kuch baat-cheet
Dekhta hun main jise who chup teri mehfil mein hai
Aye shaheed-e-mulk-o-millat main tere oopar nisaar
Ab teri himmat ka charcha ghair ki mehfil mein hai
Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamaare dil mein hai
<p style="text-align:justify;">Waqt aanay dey bata denge tujhe aye aasman
Hum abhi se kya batayen kya hamare dil mein hai
Khainch kar layee hai sab ko qatl hone ki ummeed
Aashiqon ka aaj jumghat koocha-e-qaatil mein hai
Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamaare dil mein hai
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hai liye hathiyaar dushman taak mein baitha udhar
Aur hum taiyyaar hain seena liye apna idhar
Khoon se khelenge holi gar vatan muskhil mein hai
Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamaare dil mein hai
<p style="text-align:justify;">Haath jin mein ho junoon katt te nahi talvaar se
Sar jo uth jaate hain voh jhukte nahi lalkaar se
Aur bhadkega jo shola-sa humaare dil mein hai
Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamaare dil mein hai
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hum to ghar se nikle hi the baandhkar sar pe kafan
Jaan hatheli par liye lo barh chale hain ye qadam
Zindagi to apni mehmaan maut ki mehfil mein hai
Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamaare dil mein hai
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yuun khadaa maqtal mein qaatil kah rahaa hai baar baar
Kya tamannaa-e-shahaadat bhi kisee ke dil mein hai
Dil mein tuufaanon ki toli aur nason mein inqilaab
Hosh dushman ke udaa denge humein roko na aaj
Duur reh paaye jo humse dam kahaan manzil mein hai
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wo jism bhi kya jism hai jismein na ho khoon-e-junoon
Toofaanon se kya lade jo kashti-e-saahil mein hai
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamaare dil mein hai.
Dekhna hai zor kitna baazuay qaatil mein hai.

			 <p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5944/1659/1600/017366.jpg"><img style="float:left;cursor:pointer;margin:0 10px 10px 0;" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2020/2dd3905a13.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">I always come up with a statement &ldquo;Sachin is not a Match Winner&rdquo;. And if you try to go to the depth of the statement, you will find that the people mainly complain about following issues:</span><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">1) He never sails india to victory.</span><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">2) He is never there till the end.</span><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">3) He never strikes in a crucial stage.</span><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">4) He never plays well in finals.</span><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">5) He plays only on the Batsmen Friendly Indian Pitches</span><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">6) He is not like Lara, Steve Waugh or Bevan.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">Before we start looking at each issue, lets try to answer a couple of questions first:</span><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">1) Who is a Match Winner?</span><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">2) Can a single person win the matches for a country?</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">Ok so lets move to the first question. So is &ldquo;Match Winner&rdquo; the one who stays till the end? If that&rsquo;s the case then Srinath and Kumble were the match winners in the 3rd match of Titan Cup played against Australia on 21st October 1996. But still the man of the match award was given to the Sachin. Because he was holding one end of the indian innings when the greats like Dravid, Ganguly and Azar were making their way to pavalion. He was sailing India home with a great victory but for a good ball which he just happened to misjudge. This was the innings that created a base for the &ldquo;rare&rdquo; nice flicks from the two Bangaloreans and made them to take India to a fantastic win and they get full credit for doing it with perfection.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">Now lets consider a Test Match. Take the 2nd test of the Border-Gavaskar trophy played against Australia on 26-30 December 1999. The first innings of Australia saw 405 runs. Thanks to great innings by Slater, Langer, Gilchrist and even some fine knocks by Fleming and Lee down the order. India&rsquo;s 1st innings score was 238 which had a fine inning of 116 from the Little Master. He was the 9th man to get out. Then Australia scored 208 runs before declaring their second innings. In the responce, India just managed to score 195 runs again having an inning of 52 from Tendulkar. But then he could not sail india to victory at last. Still the man of the match was given to him. Can we imply from this test that Sachin was not a match winner as he didn&rsquo;t won the test for india? No we can&rsquo;t!!!!</span><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5944/1659/1600/0165731.jpg"><img style="float:right;cursor:pointer;margin:0 0 10px 10px;" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2020/e7d6dc622a.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">But then you again can&rsquo;t say that Sachin was the match winner in the First match we discussed. No he wasn&rsquo;t. On the contrary, no one can be a match winner in a team game like Cricket. You cannot neglect the support he got from Jadeja and Mongia that helped him to to take india on the verge of a win and then the nice flicks from Srinath and Kumble that sailed India to victory. You cannot forget even a small contribution of 30 odd runs in Cricket because that, with a partnership, counts big. Even in case of the test discussed, same thing would have happened if sachin would have got some support from his fellow teammates. The fault was not Sachin&rsquo;s — it was just that India could not find a Fleming/Lee who could score some runs down the order in the first innings.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">People may query &ldquo;why are you just considering these two innings?&rdquo; Or may be something like &ldquo;You are getting biased&rdquo;. But then I am not discussing the greatness of Sachin. I am just trying to judge the statement about match winner concept which I totally disbelieve exists. I think these facts are good enough to prove that the fist two issues can be discarded when you say he is not the match winner and very well answer the two questions we developed.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">So lets move to 3rd and 4th issues. I think these don&rsquo;t need to be discussed seperately as they are too similar. No situation can be more crucial than the final of a series. Here i will just like to ask one simple question. How many of these finals would india have reached but for Sachin? Does it not take some fine performances to win the matches which take us to the final? C&rsquo;mon man. After all he is an human being who too has got limits. Nobody in the world can be perfect and neither is Sachin. But the mere fact that he doesn&rsquo;t play in finals unlike few others (not Indians offcourse because i guess no indians play well in finals) doesn&rsquo;t reduce his briliance.</span><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">Or it can again not imply/disprove that he is not a match winner.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">The fifth query can be considered in two parts. 1) On Batsmen friendly pitches: Ok then i think this is a part of the game. Sachin is a batsmen and every batsmen is considered to play well on batsmen friendly pitches. But it will be wrong to say that he plays only on batsmen friendly tracks. Because he do have a few innings under his belt to disprove this statement including the ones at bulawayo and johannesburg against Zim and SA. Lets move to second part.</span><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">2)On Indian pithces: This statement will be best judged by few statistics which I will soon come up with.</span><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5944/1659/1600/024164.jpg"><img style="float:left;cursor:pointer;margin:0 10px 10px 0;" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2020/cffef1f884.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">Lets move to the last and the most important comment. He is obviously not like Waugh, Lara, Inzi. He is far ahead of Waugh and Inzi and in case of Lara, I will just say its better not to judge one greats performance in the vision of the others. But I can say one thing. Sachin may not be a Steve Waugh but then he does not have a Warne, Gillespie or Lee who could win a match by hitting the last few runs after he scores a century. Lara and Waugh both had great teams to back their efforts, not just a few good players like what Sachin has. Tendulkar has shone as the lone gladiator for India.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">So I think everybody should stop worrying about who is a batter match winner and enjoy the game of all the greats. One thing is for sure. Today, when Sachin goes out to bat, he has over a billion people praying for him. So, whether he is a MATCH-WINNER or not, who cares: he is a HEART-WINNER. Today&rsquo;s great moments are tommorow&rsquo;s sweet memories. Though Dravid might be &ldquo;the great WALL of India&rdquo;, if you look beyond the wall you can see a monument, an &ldquo;Unconquerable Everest&rdquo;, in Sachin Tendulkar.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 102);">In the end, I would just like to put a plain request to all those who debate on this topic. Just leave the man, who has given 14 years of his life to his passion, alone and don&rsquo;t put him under a microscope. This will sure help you enjoy the numerous innings he had played and the numerous he is yet to play. I CONGRATS THE LITTLE MASTER for all the fine innings he has played and wish him all the best for his remaining carrier. So bowlers beware. SACHIN AALA RE!!!!</span><br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5944/1659/1600/sachin_adi_800x600.jpg"><img style="float:left;cursor:pointer;margin:0 10px 10px 0;" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7936/2020/a975ea46fd.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>
