			 <p>Spent an hour today writing a post that eventually felt inauthentic. I only realised after writing it that I had no opinion on the topic. Why did I think I needed to have one?</p>
<p>It happens a lot when I read meta posts on writing. I tend to get swayed and believe that I ought to contribute. I don’t.</p>

<p>But that doesn’t change the fact that kids need their independent peer cultures. If we can’t provide physical spaces for them to form, then we must accept that they will often form in digital spaces instead. So if we’re unhappy with the digital spaces on offer — if we think there are too many figurative leopards in those forests — then we should make something better.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last week, I was on a work trip to Chennai. I have been to this town before, but never spent any meaningful time here. It was either during a packed schedule or during a layover en route to places like Pondicherry.</p>
<p>The schedule this time was different &ndash; I had a free workday, which I wanted to make full use of.  So I decided to take an auto to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Elliot%27s_Beach">Elliot&rsquo;s Beach</a> and walk down <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Vf9q2jKPXtG7vs7b6">Elliot&rsquo;s Promenade</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It had rained throughout the day, and the weather had cleared slightly as the evening dawned. I had forgotten my AirPods at my hotel &ndash; and I could not have been happier. I got to enjoy the place in its most natural form—the wind, the sounds, the absence of the hustle and bustle that comes with a beach in India.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I spent a good couple of hours roaming around the empty street, drank a couple of filter coffees. Walked down a wooden walkway <em>straight to the crashing waves</em> &ndash; I couldn&rsquo;t have been happier to see that, given that I didn&rsquo;t carry any extra shoes with me.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s a place I would love to spend every evening at. At the same time, Chennai is not a city I can ever settle in. So the evening was a one-off, but I carried back many memories with me.</p>

			 <p>I have enabled the crossposting to all places again. Why? No reason. I have anyway been crossposting to Mastodon, which is the only social network I have been active on. But that need not be the case.</p>
<p>I am tired of <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/blog/2025/10-nov-2025-at-9-11-am/">overthinking stuff</a> around my blogging. It&rsquo;s okay if things aren&rsquo;t perfect. I won&rsquo;t worry about what reaches which audience.</p>
<p>I am happy as long as I write.</p>
<p>Wherever I get responses, I will reply. Participate in whichever stream I am in the mood to dip my toes in. Or stay away if that&rsquo;s what feels right at that moment. Better to keep experimenting than to let things get stagnant.</p>

			 <p>I came across this beautiful Welsh word for poetic inspiration <em>Awen</em>. I loved the sound of this word and what it represents. Even <a href="https://symbolsage.com/awen-symbol-meaning/">the symbol and the meaning behind</a> took me on a journey.</p>
<p>&gt; Awen is an important symbol in Celtic culture. It&rsquo;s a symbol of creativity, imagination, and aesthetic sensibility. In the Celtic language, Awen means essence or poetic inspiration. While seemingly simple in appearance, the Awen holds deep symbolic meaning.</p>

<p>I finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780063279094">Everyone on This Train Is a Suspect</a> by Benjamin Stevenson recently 📚</p>
<p>I enjoyed the first Ernest Cunningham novel with its uniquely fresh narration style. Though the second in the series has a similar tone, it felt repetitively bland this time. The story takes ages to kick off. Humour barely lands and feels there only to fill the pages. The same goes for the &ldquo;cute&rdquo; and frequent talk with readers—it just didn&rsquo;t land for me. It irritated me every time.</p>
<p>I listened to this book this time, and the narration was terrible. It was so fast and messy that I couldn&rsquo;t understand which character was speaking. I couldn&rsquo;t get involved thoroughly; I was waiting for the book to end.</p>

			 <p>Today, I pushed a minor release for <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/22">Posts Stats plugin</a> that enables (and defaults to) collapsing the table for the posts by year. You can expand the table by clicking the &ldquo;Show Posts by Year&rdquo; button below the chart. It should make the page slightly shorter and easier to follow.</p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> If the button to expand the table does not work by default, your theme might not import JavaScript from plugins correctly. Ideally, you should have the following code block around the footer layout. If you are unable to figure it out, email me. I will try to help you debug.</p>

			 <p>There are two writers within me. One wants me to write as freely and as frequently as possible, blurting out everything that comes to my mind. The other wants me to weigh each word, think deeply, and post only when I have something meaningful to say. Every time they fight, which they do often, my writing stops.

			 <p>I have enjoyed writing at Scribbles recently &ndash; you can follow these posts <a href="https://amitg.blog/feed.atom">through the RSS feed</a>. The simplicity of the posting workflow has me hooked. The biggest draw for me is that I can easily begin a draft and expand it with more thoughts across multiple sittings. It&rsquo;s a lot more frictionless than what I have found anywhere recently. The interface suits the kind of posts I am inclined to write these days - <a href="https://amitg.blog/">blogging</a> regularly about life and writing.</p>
<p>I am sure the platform won&rsquo;t work for all. There&rsquo;s no support for theming. No automatic cross-posting. No markdown. Micro posts don&rsquo;t sit well on the platform, either. For all that, there&rsquo;s <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2024/01/13/my-experiments-with.html">no better platform than Micro.blog</a>. Scribbles, on the other hand, strips the blogging to the bare. To what matters: writing blog posts. And for that, the platform does enough.</p>
<p>So, keep an eye on <a href="https://scribbles.page/">Scribbles</a>. It <a href="https://scribbles.page/updates/posts/an-update-launch-date-plans-and-setting-it-straight-l8csnr4t">will launch soon</a> to be available for sign-ups.</p>

			 <p>Exactly <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2024/01/11/i-will-no.html">a month ago</a>, I decided to stop syndicating my posts to any social networks. What have I learnt in this month?</p>
<p>The interactions on my posts have significantly gone down. Every post had some replies earlier. No surprise, most were on Micro.blog. A few were on Mastodon. Both have naturally gone down to zero. I have received a few emails (and fewer comments through Commento). I responded to each of them, which is something I cannot say about the earlier replies I received on the timelines. My genuine lack of interest in checking my mentions and responding to them was why I had stopped syndication.</p>
<p>How about traffic (<em>yuck!</em>)? I have no clue. Though I have analytics enabled with <a href="https://tinylytics.app/">Tinylytics</a>, I don&rsquo;t follow the numbers. I don&rsquo;t know what the numbers were earlier and how they have been impacted. There is also a possibility that most follow my blog through RSS. Whatever the case, I don&rsquo;t know, and I don&rsquo;t have any interest in finding out.</p>
<p>The most noticeable impact has been on my writing &ndash; I have stopped writing for a timeline.</p>
<p>Earlier, I subconsciously filtered all my posts through the lens of how they would look on a timeline. Or to the folks who tend to reply to my posts frequently. <em>Is this too long? Too short? Does this interest all? Or some? Or anyone at all?</em>  My mind was always crowded with such unnecessary doubts. I <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2022/05/24/193000.html">observed this behaviour first</a> a couple of years ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing publicly, with the voice of your readers chirping at the back of your mind, is ineffective. You write for interaction – that&rsquo;s futile. Most social media posts belong to this category. You are reined back by the voice — you write for someone else. The response you expect from them, your readers, provides you the lead. You write not what you like, you write what you think your reader likes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I even mentioned people through their social media handles in my posts. Futile, I agree. But the whole experience felt unnecessarily limiting, and I lacked the control to not let it feel.</p>
<p>What does all of this mean for my no-syndication experiment? As of now, nothing has changed. I like this unshackled feeling while I write. As if no one&rsquo;s watching and weighing up my every word.</p>
<p>How about taking my writing to the readers? I am yet to find an organic way to do that. Automatic <em>and passive</em> syndication is not that.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday, I was sitting with my iPad Mini on the sunny balcony, with my sister&rsquo;s iPhone and my Galaxy S24 Ultra next to me. Barely able to read on my iPad, I picked up my phone and was reminded how I had fallen absolutely in love with this device. Especially the two aspects. The stunning screen. The monstrous battery life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I have seen <strong>a better screen</strong> than what this has. All reviews have called it out. But you must experience it to appreciate the brilliance of what Samsung has achieved. The text is crisp; the colours pop out. Plus, the lack of reflection is mindblowing. I don&rsquo;t think I can go back to any other device now that doesn&rsquo;t have the technical wizardry that Samsung has packaged here. It&rsquo;s perfectly visible even in the harshest sunlight without losing clarity or colour.</p>
<p>I am surprised no one built such a screen earlier. This is much more important than the high refresh rate or crazy resolutions. Here&rsquo;s a snapshot from <a href="https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s24-ultra/">the official product page</a>.﻿</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>﻿The second one is also a no-brainer with its trade-off &ndash; <strong>the battery life</strong>. Since moving to smartphones in 2009 with the iPhone 3GS, I haven&rsquo;t had any phone with a battery life longer than a day. But then I also stubbornly preferred phones with smaller dimensions. I never liked the likes of Notes and Plueses and Pros and Maxes. So, my decision to shift to a large phone this time was clouded by my fear of discomfort.</p>
<p>All my fears were washed away right on the second day when my phone wasn&rsquo;t screaming at me to be plugged in. My last phone, the Galaxy S22, was the slickest of all the devices I have ever owned. But it was frustrating to put it to charging every evening. From that to now, when I am easily going through two full days without charging my phone, it is a drastic (and welcome) change. <em>Even three days once</em>. This might be a benefit that all large phones share. But with everything this device packs, it has to be the best amongst the best.</p>
<p>Even without the natural benefit of a larger screen to read and write better, I would always select a larger phone from now on just for the battery life it lends.</p>
<p>In addition, there are miscellaneous benefits of Samsung&rsquo;s versions of Android phones for me. They have been nailing the physical design of the phones for the past few years. Without all the gloss, they look and feel premium in hand. Everyone who has held this device has commended the richness of its feel.</p>
<p>One UI feels slick, elevating the overall Android experience a notch higher. It&rsquo;s inherently Google but distinctly Samsung at the same time. All the small touches they add across the platform are well thought through. The ones that I have found the most used are <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00083201/">Modes and Routines</a>. It helps set your phone for different phases of the day. I can customize all aspects, the most important being which apps I access during a particular mode. For example, in Life mode, I have set it so that I can&rsquo;t use any apps from my work even if I wanted to. Neither do I get notifications from them. ﻿</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>﻿Samsung has woven a lot of such small additions into the platform. S Pen works nicely. The side Panel stays hidden, yet it is extremely useful. Dex is <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2023/01/11/android-has-a.html">an absolute stunner</a>. And the list goes on.</p>
<p>This post has gone on for much longer than I initially expected. And I haven&rsquo;t even talked about the cameras. With Galaxy S24 Ultra, Samsung has indeed mastered the smartphone.</p>

			 <p>Maya <a href="https://maya.land/monologues/2023/12/26/laptop-of-the-magi-apple-antitrust.html">narrates an annoying annectode</a> involving iMessages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By buying my mother a gift, I have now made it so that her contacts with iPhones, who all have her email saved, will – by default – send her messages that she cannot access on her phone, and they won’t know that they’re doing this when trying to text her. This seems terrible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <em>is</em> terrible. I recall I had gone through a similar frenzy when I had switched from my iPhone to Android. Getting back my messages from the clutches of iMessages was so painful. I had to go through this again when I bought my iMac and <em>Apple decided</em> I want messages with my email. It&rsquo;s frustrating to see the limits Apple goes to to decide on its user&rsquo;s behalf what&rsquo;s best for them. I really resonate with this thought from Maya (emphasis mine).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If they’d just built their own thing in a separate app that needed both sides <em>to explicitly opt-in</em> to use in their communication, I wouldn’t be writing this!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amen! Only saving grace is there are not many in my family or friends circle who use iPhone.</p>

			 <p>At the start of every year, I read posts from people where they set goals for themselves. I love the theme, but setting goals or resolutions doesn&rsquo;t work well. I am not a stickler for goal tracking.</p>
<p>Recently, I read a couple of posts where people put out a list of <em>their hopes</em> for the year. <a href="https://mei.bearblog.dev/24-hopes-for-2024/">Latest from mei</a>. This inspired me to pen one for myself. I thought I might struggle to create such a list when I started writing this. It was surprisingly simple when I put them in buckets - self, health, relationships and interests. So, here we go!</p>
<ol>
<li>Write more than I did in 2023 - target 365 posts</li>
<li>Read one book in a month - target 12 books</li>
<li>Publish one short story</li>
<li>Find a medium that helps me be social on the web</li>
<li>Find a place for music in my life again</li>
<li>Make a journal entry at least once a week</li>
<li>Keep <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/#stories">stories</a> on my website updated with one new photo every week</li>
<li>Go on a date with my wife once a month</li>
<li>Go on a play date with my daughter once a month</li>
<li>Family dinner with my wife and daughter once a month</li>
<li>Take one picture of my daughter and one of me &amp; my wife every week</li>
<li>Meet my two friends circle once a month</li>
<li>Inspire interest in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@curiousbee">Curious Bee</a> to create again</li>
<li>Find and connect with people whose ideas resonate with me</li>
<li>Improve physical fitness by walking 5 days a week</li>
<li>Improve mental fitness by meditating 5 days a week</li>
<li>Do Pranayama and Surya Namaskar at least 2 times a week</li>
<li>Take care of my face</li>
<li>Achieve better work-life balance, <em>minimize life during work</em></li>
<li>Learn to cook roti</li>
<li>Visit a cafe alone once a month</li>
<li>Speak up my mind, even if it disappoints others</li>
<li>Learn to use the calendar to structure day and week</li>
<li>Learn to use my smartphone better for reading and writing</li>
</ol>
<p>I accept it&rsquo;s slightly late to publish such a list. But I have already been working on a few of these. Plus, it&rsquo;s better late than never.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t posted anything since I <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2024/01/28/i-am-leaning.html">last wondered</a> &ldquo;why I even write anymore in public&rdquo;. This question still crowds my mind. But I read what other folks write, which, in turn, makes me want to do that. So, I am <em>not</em> going to stop writing on my blog anytime soon.</p>
<p>What do I write about? Well, about nothing and everything. That has been my mantra.</p>
<p>I usually do not have a set template for my posts. I start writing, and the thoughts pour themselves out. The only thing I have to do is sit down at my desk and start hammering on my keyboard.</p>
<p>Recently, I read some excellent posts on blogging versus social media. The first is Robb Knight talking about how <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/the-web-is-fantastic/">the web is fantastic</a>. This feeling resonated with my current state of mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blogs and RSS never died. Some of us just took a little break from it while we all shitposted on Twitter for likes, retweets, and validation. While we wrote long, unfindable threads instead of blog posts. I&rsquo;m as guilty of this as anyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s been some time now since I posted to any social network. <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2024/01/11/i-will-no.html">20 days to be exact</a>. It&rsquo;s freeing to not worry about how my posts look on different timelines or how people react to them. I write on <em>and for</em> my blog. I have also accepted that I won&rsquo;t get any reaction on even my most thoughtful posts.</p>
<p>I have yet to find a frictionless way to respond to a post I read. <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2024/01/21/i-wish-every.html">I want that</a>.</p>
<p>The second post is <a href="https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/blogging-is-where-its-at-again/">Chris McLeod vouching for the resurgence of blogging</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[S]tumbling into such a trove of active blogs has enthused me about blogging as a medium again. It&rsquo;s sparked a thought that through a combination of increased blogging activity, declining platforms, and increasing adoption of open standards to glue everything together, that maybe — just maybe — we can swing the web back towards the blog again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I share Chris&rsquo;s optimism &ndash; posting micro thoughts on social media led to the discovery of many good bloggers. I maintain my apprehensions about micro posts on the blog &ndash; <em>I cannot write and post them</em>. But I am okay with others doing it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I continue to read blogs through RSS. I continue to write on my blog. All&rsquo;s well.</p>

			 <p>I received yesterday the Galaxy 24 Ultra that <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2024/01/20/when-i-upgraded.html">I had preordered</a>. A quick opinion after a day&rsquo;s use &ndash; I am mighty impressed. Stunning display. Monstrous battery. And a brilliant camera &ndash; I have taken a few shots in low light and portraits, and boy, am I impressed. This is the basic feature set that matters to me.</p>
<p>With a place now for <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/#stories">my snaps on my website</a>, I am going to have so much fun taking pictures with this set of cameras.</p>
<p>Coming from a smaller screen size of Galaxy S22, I was very worried that I might not like the massive size jump. But I think <em>I am going to love this size</em>. It has a lot of space for all the elements on the screen. One that also renders a lot of crisp words &ndash; I am now on the lookout for more to read.</p>
<p>The overall experience feels buttery smooth. The feel in the hand is light, yet premium. Plus, did I say that I love the larger screen on the phone!?</p>

			 <p>I wish every blog post had a footer with easy ways to respond, preferably via email. The early days of blogging were simple, with a plain comments section. All one had to do was add details about themselves and comment. Spam ruined the simplicity, and accounts were required to be created just to add a comment.</p>
<p>I yearn for those simpler days. I recently added a way to comment below my posts, powered by <a href="https://commento.io/">Commento</a>. The simplicity of this system does have a price associated with it. But I want to keep that option around since I <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2024/01/11/i-will-no.html">stopped syndicating</a> posts to the social timelines.</p>
<p>Plus, the readers can always respond via email. I am relieved to see responses received through both of these mediums.</p>
<p>At the same time, it pains me when I open a blog post looking for a way to respond, and I can&rsquo;t find any. Even if there is one, it is generally via some social network, which I am not keen to participate in. Please have a link to respond via email. Someday, you will receive a thoughtful response that will warm your heart.</p>

			 <p>When I upgraded to Galaxy S22 a couple of years back, I wrote this about my initial impressions about the device.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love the design of this phone, plus the feel in the hand. It&rsquo;s compact yet powerful. I also like what Samsung has done with Android. This is possibly the best compact smartphone out there. Not just with Android.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a couple of years with a compact phone, I have decided to jump to the other extreme. I have preordered the Galaxy S24 Ultra. I want to use a monstrous phone now. Though the compact phone was brilliant for general use, two issues have troubled me a lot.</p>
<p>The first is battery life. It barely lasted a whole day for me. If I use it heavily, I would need to juice it up towards the evening. With a bigger phone comes a bigger battery. I require a phone that lasts at least a day now.</p>
<p>The second is the smaller screen wasn&rsquo;t the best to read and write. Especially later. I felt constrained and generally preferred to read on my iPad and write on my iMac or laptop. I hope both changes with a larger screen.</p>
<p>I knew back then that Galaxy Ultra was the device I wanted next. I will have one next week.</p>

			 <p>Friday evening began promising and then just fizzled out. I had planned many tasks but couldn&rsquo;t get through to the majority. One big reason is that <em>I am shit tired</em>. My time at work is hectic. Worse, it is chaotic. So, each day leaves me mentally exhausted. Today was no different.</p>
<p>Not that I work long hours. Just the daily grind of finding clarity amidst the chaos, finding the right answers and the way forward sips the energy and drive from the non-office hours. Friday&rsquo;s are worse because there&rsquo;s the unspoken promise of recuperating through the imminent weekend. So, I simply give up on all the plans and sway along with my wandering mind.</p>
<p>Today was no different, as I signed the day off. With the hope that tomorrow, I regain the drive and cover for the time I lost.</p>

			 <p>I watched the <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech/">Rabbit R1</a> keynote for the first time, and I have to say it&rsquo;s an exciting device. What surprised me the most was the price! How can any AI-based device be launched at this price range? And that&rsquo;s when I looked at the specs. Behind all the funky-looking exterior, it&rsquo;s underpowered inside. Also, tells me most of the functionality happens in the cloud.</p>
<p>The makers have smartly called out that this does not replace your smartphone. It&rsquo;s a companion device. And that&rsquo;s where I have my doubts about R1. It might sell brilliantly at the beginning, which it already is, according to the reports. But I am afraid it will lie forgotten in the drawers for many.</p>
<p>An exciting, cute tech nonetheless. The question is, are we ready for an AI-only device?</p>

			 <p>I have uninstalled all the filler apps from my smartphone. There&rsquo;s no social network or news or video app. Yet I reach out for the device if it is around me. I won&rsquo;t do anything there. Open emails to find nothing new. Open some random website. Or worse just check if there are any notifications. This is pitiful. I need a filler activity that&rsquo;s better than swiping randomly on my smartphone.</p>
<p>A filler activity is the one I would do when I am not fully focused on something. While I sit in meetings where I am just a listener. While I wait for my food. While I start while my tea is brewing. Unfortunately, my smartphone continues to occupy such periods currently.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>For the past few years, Micro.blog has hosted this blog. Every year, I revisit that decision to verify if it still is the best choice for me. I did that last year. And I did the year before. Every time, I have decided to stick to this wonderful platform. Unlike earlier, when I made such decisions by listing pros and cons, the last two times I made it based on my experience of using the other services over a year.</p>
<p>I have recently read a lot of people revisiting their choices of platforms and thought I should share about my experiments. I had shared my views once <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2022/02/15/why-microblog-works.html">in 2022</a>. This post is for the experiments since then.</p>
<p>Before that, here&rsquo;s a quick note on how I give myself time to arrive at this decision. <em>I have never changed my primary platform</em>. I sign up for an annual plan with a service, set it on a custom sub-domain and use it for a full year. Sure, it&rsquo;s a costly option. But as the subscription ends, I have no doubts about my decision. Neither do I have any urge to switch platforms every time I see it discussed. Anyway, onto my experiments.</p>
<p>In 2022, I was fascinated by what Ghost promised as a platform. It was well-reviewed, polished and highly recommended. It suited the long-form style of writing I wanted to do more of. It had a built-in newsletter. I wanted all of that. The question was, can it become my primary blogging platform. A year of continuous usage convinced me it wasn&rsquo;t. Though I liked what it offered, it didn&rsquo;t fit my style of writing. I am very informal in what I write. Sometimes, it is heartfelt life stories. Other times, it&rsquo;s meaningless updates. More often, it&rsquo;s the latter. Ghost isn&rsquo;t a right fit for such posts.</p>
<p>For starters, it continues to need a title. And images. It wants me to play around with the metadata of the post. Before I can publish a post, all the bells and whistles distract me and I start to question if my words are worth all this polish. That&rsquo;s not the feeling I want when I am about to click publish. It limits what I can do with the styling. Even the paid plan has a very limited selection of themes. Plus even with all these limitations, it is pricey. I do not earn from my blog &ndash; so $9 per month paid annually isn&rsquo;t cheap.</p>
<p>Last year I picked up Write.as to experiment with. Unlike Ghost, its plans are simple &ndash; so I again signed up for an annual plan which unlocks all the paid features. Most importantly custom domain. I set it up as a place for my quick, unformed thoughts. It supports both short and long posts well. Plus it has got hands-down <em>the best editor to write posts in</em>. I could never write quick, short posts &ndash; it was that good.</p>
<p>But there are significant downsides that I cannot brush aside. Adding images to posts isn&rsquo;t easy &ndash; need to go to a separate place to do that. The published posts look clean, but soulless. The options for styling are extremely limited. An ability to extend the capabilities is almost non-existent. The selection of good themes is negligible. The biggest problem of all is the publishing workflow, especially writing drafts, which is very frustrating. Drafts are posts published anonymously. But publishing them back to the main blog isn&rsquo;t intuitive. The published dates get all messed up.</p>
<p>Also, I am not sure if the platform is in active development. Over the past year, I hardly saw anything change. I don&rsquo;t want to spend time on a platform that&rsquo;s ignored.</p>
<p>On both occasions, I cancelled my plan at the end of the subscription period and moved all the posts to Micro.blog. With redirects set automatically, it was as if the posts were always published here. I respect <a href="https://www.manton.org/">Manton</a> for being always supportive and for actively discouraging lock-in by simplifying moving in to or out of Micro.blog.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I had written last time while talking about why Micro.blog works for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]t suits well for both the micro and long-form posts. It has apps for all platforms that I primarily use Mac and Android. Quick notes are best made with the apps, especially so from smartphone. For posts that are long, titled, <del>Ulysses</del> iA Writer works perfectly well for me. No other CMS can ever work as well as a native application.</p>
<p>The platform is built on Hugo. And I love Hugo. (&hellip;) Building extensions in your templates is so easy, and I have gotten comfortable with it. Manton has added just enough around Hugo to make it even more useful — the APIs, the apps, the social aspects, the open plug-in and theming systems and, the most valuable, its community.</p>
<p>Do I use all of them [smart features]? Of course, not. But the fact that one plan provides me so much over and above the basic blogging functionality is priceless for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of this has changed even now. I also haven&rsquo;t observed the stability issues that I see people complain about recently. May be I have just been lucky.</p>
<p>No surprise then, that Micro.blog continues to be my blogging platform of choice.</p>

			 <p>I will no longer syndicate my posts to any social network timelines, that includes Micro.blog. This is the last post that gets syndicated.

If you are keen to know what I am up to, you can <a href="https://amitgawande.com/feed/">follow the RSS feed</a>.</p>
<p>For some time now, I haven&rsquo;t been active on any social timelines. I simply <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2024/01/09/i-am-losing.html">can&rsquo;t keep up</a>. It doesn&rsquo;t serve the purpose if I don&rsquo;t contribute to the network and interact. At times, days go by before I respond to the mentions I receive and worse, I hardly ever reply to others' posts. Being passively around the timeline only adds to the subconscious burden.</p>
<p>I also want to minimise distractions with my presence on the internet to lend myself more chances to build the right routines. Anything and everything that causes even a hint of friction has to be out. Given my general lack of patience for the hustle of social networks, they had to be out the door first.</p>
<p>I want to simplify everything. The tools I use. What I read. The way I write. <em>Simple</em>, that&rsquo;s my word for the year.</p>

			 <p>I <a href="https://amitg.blog/self-discipline-is-a-paradox">have been thinking</a> a lot recently about self-discipline and doing things I love. I want to understand why I need self-discipline to make myself do things that I love. There can be two reasons for this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an inherent dichotomy between the things that I love and the things I want to believe I love. Maybe I don&rsquo;t <em>love</em> love journaling. Or meditating. But I want to believe I do. Hence, I need to fit these into my routine, or I just won&rsquo;t do it. On the other hand, I do love reading blogs and non-fiction. Or mysteries. So, I don&rsquo;t need a routine to make myself follow people&rsquo;s feeds. Or read books. If this is the case, how can I separate things that I love from those I want to believe I love?</p>
<p>Another reason might be that the things I love aren&rsquo;t easy for me to do. I haven&rsquo;t mastered how to meditate. Or to journal. They don&rsquo;t come naturally to me and hence, even a feeble friction &ndash; late nights or a busy work schedule or an unplanned travel &ndash; derails all my attempts to do any of these regularly. I need self-discipline to force myself to do such activities regularly (and patiently) as only through repetition will I master them. Only then would they start coming naturally to me.</p>
<p>I am yet to be convinced of the real reason. Maybe it is both; maybe neither. Whatever the case, I continue to force a routine on myself for I know of no other path to self-discipline.</p>

			 <p>I watched three movies over the weekend. I don&rsquo;t usually do this, but after <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2024/01/03/the-last-few.html">a hectic week at work</a>, I had to give myself some relief. Two of the three movies were absolutely (and surprisingly) brilliant. Another one was just a mindless filler.</p>
<p>The first was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23849204/">12th Fail</a>. Such an inspiring story told in a simple, no-nonsense manner. In today&rsquo;s phase of over-produced, over-dramatic, loud action movies, the plain narration was a treat. There was no ear-splitting background music and no unnecessary slow-motion effects. The life the movie was based on already had enough drama that it didn&rsquo;t need any additional <em>masala</em>. Plus the music from Shantanu Moitra was mesmerising, especially the track <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3ywlNiy0UNpjqI1pGckbf2?si=4d672d59979a41ce">Bolo Na</a> that plays in the film. A beautiful, uplifting movie that can be watched with family, something that&rsquo;s rare these days!</p>
<p>Next, we watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6495056/">Migration</a> &ndash; an unplanned rush to the theatre with the only intention to spend quality family time. And we did. A light, colourful movie with moments of hearty laughs. Of course, with a bucket of popcorn and coke. I always feel refreshed when my daughter has a wonderful time in a movie theatre. Watching her guffaw at the silliest of the jokes brings a big smile to my face. Today was no different.</p>
<p>With this much of the weekend spent on entertainment, I still had time for myself, for writing and lots of reading. I must be doing something right. I have a theory, but I am not ready to share it yet.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;Self-discipline is overrated. I should do what makes me feel good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just doing what makes me feel good makes me lazy. I need self-discipline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are the two extremes I hop between. I would love to be in the middle somewhere. Self-disciplined enough not to be lazy, yet allow myself space to do what I love. Is attaining such a balance a myth? And what <em>do</em> I love? What <em>does</em> make me feel good?</p>
<p>Is it anything that&rsquo;s frictionless or passive, like watching TV or clicking through YouTube recommendations? Or is it something that lends me a hollow feeling of achievement? Like reading random &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; posts that I have no interest in? It must be neither. It is both.</p>
<p>Irrespective of which extreme I find myself at, I subconsciously judge how I spend my free time. It can&rsquo;t be healthy. But I haven&rsquo;t yet mastered the way not to be self-judgemental.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I want to achieve. Be self-disciplined. To do things that keep me void of any guilt. But shouldn&rsquo;t those be the things that make me feel good? As a result, won&rsquo;t self-discipline make me lazy?</p>

			 <p>I came across this prompt a while back, which I had no opinion on. I wanted to attempt to elaborate my thoughts on it now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone looked at how you spent your time over the last year, would what they see as your priorities match what you see as your priorities?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I had set health and focus as my priority for the year. Even after starting the year well, I didn&rsquo;t spend enough time on any of those. What&rsquo;s worse is that towards the end of the year, I was numb enough not to attempt doing any of them.</p>
<p>The results are here to show. I am distracted. I am not in the best of my shape.</p>
<p>Is it time to set them as a priority again, then? Nope. It is time to discover why my attempts were derailed later last year.</p>

			 <p>Back from a week-long vacation, the first thought I had when I logged into my system after a couple of days rest was <em>I must have missed so much</em>. I wasn&rsquo;t wrong, of course. My feed reader and timelines were full of unread posts. I did what any sane mind <em>should</em> do - I marked all items as read and started fresh.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very unlike me. I tend to skim through the list and keep things to catch up on later and discard everything else. I simply discarded everything this time. I have learned from the past. I rarely catch up. The list stares back at me the psychological pressure rising with each day until I eventually mark everything as read.</p>
<p>I pre-empted that this time.</p>
<p>One entry missing from the list to handle this time was my email inbox. Surprisingly, HEY has that covered brilliantly. Nothing that&rsquo;s not of interest reaches my inbox anymore. After a period of indecision on the utility of HEY, I am hooked to the service now that it has solved my email problem.</p>

<p>Start with titleless posts as the base, making them first-class citizens. Stitch the design around that. And then add support for titles. People latched on to the microblogging phenomenon of Twitter and Facebook because they made posting interfaces frictionless. A simple textbox floated at the top of the timeline for quick thoughts to be posted.</p>
<p>That’s what every blogging platform needs if we are to attract more people to blogging. Everything other than the content of the post is meaningless.</p>

			 <p>After deliberating over whether to offer membership for my online creations, I decided to set up a <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/amitgawande">single One a Month tier</a>. The decision to set up a membership of any form was triggered by the recent realisation that led me to pull down Scribe- the realisation that my side projects cost me dear. Every month, the prices add up, and I eventually run out of motivation to keep going.</p>
<p>However, the step to keep it simple and affordable for people considering support is inspired by a <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/@/page/FzQB8gwtyZXZ2yq3">recent post by Manu</a> where he proposed changing the defaults on pricing the support.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 1$ part means you can set it up and forget about it because it&rsquo;s a low enough amount that won&rsquo;t make too much of a difference for the majority of people who are considering supporting online creators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a period now, I have had a Buy Me a Coffee page so that others can support my hobby projects. Many have, and I could not be more grateful. I have now rolled out a simple membership to cover the projects that <strong>need hosting and, hence, carry a monthly bill</strong>. The likes of Scribe. And Micro.threads.</p>
<p>With one membership, there are no complicated tiers. And no special rewards, either. Frankly, I could limit the number of members to ten as that&rsquo;s all I need to support my ongoing side projects. But I am keeping things simple for now.</p>
<p>However, in today&rsquo;s tumultuous world, one full of uncertainty, to expect anything in return <em>for my hobby projects</em> would be unfair on my part. No obligation, hence, on anyone whatsoever.</p>

			 <p>The recent discussions around social media platforms tire me. BlueSky. Threads. Mastodon. And whatnot. They are all the same. Trying to cash in on the lost interest in Twitter. To be similar to Twitter, yet distinct at the same time. I see people try these different services and get impressed. Their interest fades away after pounding the timelines with posts. This has happened to me with all the above services.</p>
<p>The network effect that Twitter managed 15 years back won&rsquo;t be recreated. Twitter was a lone service. Fifteen years ago was a different time.</p>
<p>When I joined Twitter, I cared zilch about how I should use it. Or <em>how I shouldn&rsquo;t</em>. That was a different me then. Now, I think a lot about how and how much I should use social networks.</p>
<p>I hold myself back out of fear. Fear of uncertainty. Fear of complexity. Fear of promises.</p>
<p>The fear won&rsquo;t let me get hooked to any social networks anymore. Syndicating posts from my blog is not going to do that either.</p>

			 <p>Every morning for the past few days, I plan to sit and jot down my thoughts sometime during the day. As the evening dawns and I sign off from my work without #writing anything, the weight of unpublished thoughts pulls me down. I console myself that there&rsquo;s still night to come. I would be surrounded by silence and calmness. No distractions with everyone deep asleep. The <em>perfect conditions for me to write</em>.</p>
<p>Even though, I <a href="https://amitg.blog/its-only-been-two-weeks-since-i-have-written-a-post-every-night-and-i-already">know very well</a> that waiting for such perfect conditions is futile. The fact that I haven&rsquo;t written anything these past few days proves the point again. I can never expect to get into the flow of writing if I wait for the conditions to be exactly right.</p>
<p>Seth Godin has succinctly captured this thought in his book The Practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do the work, whether we feel like it or not, and then, without warning, flow can arise. Flow is a symptom of the work we&rsquo;re doing, not the cause of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I write when I sit down and write. Not when I am <a href="https://amitg.blog/thinking-about-writing">thinking about writing</a>. I have identified a process that works for me. I need to stick to it.</p>
<p>But should I write even if I don&rsquo;t feel like writing? Hadn&rsquo;t I read someone recommend never to write when I am tired? What if I am tired right now? You know what? The lazy in me loves to listen to others when it suits him. I need to shut him down. I need not overcomplicate things.</p>
<p>I love writing. I need to write. If it means, at times, I need to force myself to stare at a blank editor with a blinking cursor, so be it. Word will flow.</p>
<p>Plus it stops me from feeling like shit.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://amitg.blog/2023/11/27/on-routines/">On Routines</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://amitg.blog/2023/11/27/on-routines/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-11-27 23:22:30 &#43;0530">Nov 27, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As much as I love my routines, I have recently struggled to keep one. Although there are some that I regularly follow, I lack a daily routine of any sort, whether in the mornings, evenings or through the day.</p>
<p>I know the routines are essential, mainly to free up some mental space for the creative work. It <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-you-do-every-day-matters-the-power-of-routines-178592">makes sense</a> that &ldquo;regular work processes allows workers to spend less cognitive energy on recurring tasks, which can support focus and creativity for more complex tasks.&rdquo; I then find it surprising that I have a complicated relationship with my routines.</p>
<p>I wake up, sleep at fixed times, and have a chain of habits associated with the time after and before. But nothing else sticks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a time blocked for focused work. Or for my hobby projects like writing. I then wind down every day feeling frustrated not having achieved what I thought I would at the start of the day.</p>
<p>While ruminating over these struggles in my journal, I stumbled upon a realization. I cannot follow a daily routine because I lack a work-life balance. But unlike the pre-pandemic period, it is tilted much towards #life. Because I am always working from home, I surround myself with distractions while working.</p>
<p>My family, my pet and their stories. The apps on my iPad and my books. My home. All pry for my attention. And I am not strong enough to fight any of that for long.</p>
<p>When I visited the office, I had a clear separation of what I did and worked on while at the office. At home, that separation is difficult to attain. It&rsquo;s funny that this separation of space was considered important during the pandemic&rsquo;s early days. The only difference is that for others, it was not to get drained by work and leave some time for life. It is not to let my home life muddle in my work life.</p>
<p>This has had a predominant effect on my writing. I tell myself I can do it anytime, so I don&rsquo;t do it at <em>any time</em>. Why do I need a creative block marked in my calendar when I can read, write and think any time I want?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, given how lazy and prone to procrastinate I am, I do.</p>

<p>The move would appear to bring resolution to a roller coaster drama that began Friday when OpenAI announced that its non-profit board had voted to remove Altman.</p>

<p>So much drama in just five days. I am sure many secret meetings were convened, and scenarios explored.</p>

			 <p>I witnessed a minor accident today that brought back memories of a similar yet contrasting incident I was part of a few years ago. A car brushed a motorbike parked at the roadside today, and the man sitting on the bike had a tumble. He cursed. The car stopped. The driver alighted. Sensing nothing as alarming, they laughed at the situation&rsquo;s futility in a somewhat anticlimactic moment.</p>
<p>What I faced all those years back was far from ordinary, though.</p>
<p>On a late morning that day, I was driving my regular route to the office. There is a section with many overpasses, and they always get busy during peak office hours. A safe driver, I had held my lane and stayed there. I don&rsquo;t usually drive fast, and I wasn&rsquo;t even that day.</p>
<p>And out of nowhere, a forward jerk and a crashing sound warned me something had bumped into my car from behind. I peeked into the rare view mirror and saw a man in the middle of the road, a motorcycle lying a few meters away. People crowded around him, some picking him up and others doing the same to his bike.</p>
<p>Like a good samaritan and fearing the worst, I parked my car to the side and strode, worried into the crowd that had ballooned to almost fifty.</p>
<p>A scruffy guy in his early twenties was standing at the centre, multiple people checking him for injuries. I was relieved to see him standing, moving, shaking himself off the dirt. At least my worst fears were unfounded.</p>
<p>And then, out of the crowd came a question that jolted me, <em>&ldquo;Kisne thoka isko?&rdquo; - who hit him?</em> Right away, I knew things could soon get worse than anticipated. I was rushing for answers, justifications, and truths for the bulging crowd on why I wasn&rsquo;t at fault.</p>
<p>Someone touched my shoulder and said, &ldquo;In bhaisaab ka gaadi hain&rdquo;. <em>It is this man&rsquo;s car.</em></p>
<p>I knew my justifications wouldn&rsquo;t work with this crowd. They wouldn&rsquo;t even give me a chance to tell the truth. A guy walked towards the sweating me. I fumbled, searching for the right first word. But before I could utter anything, I heard a voice. &ldquo;<em>Mera galti tha</em>. It was my mistake. I was driving fast, lost control of the bike and crashed into the back of this person&rsquo;s car. It wasn&rsquo;t his mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard a few audible sighs. The voice of a man who has just been in an accident and his admission of the mistake made the crowd lose all interest.</p>
<p>As the gathering started to dwindle, I breathed a sigh of relief. I walked to the guy and asked him if he was okay. I offered to take him to the hospital if he was hurt. He declined. Though scuffed at a lot of places, he was okay overall.</p>
<p>Strangely, a few people left were getting restless again and hurling enquiries at the guy. I felt a hand on my shoulder. A man in his fifties leaned and whispered, &ldquo;<em>Saheb tumhi nigha ata</em>. You should leave now, sir. You shouldn&rsquo;t have stopped at all. Things could have gotten so out of hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though I was stunned at that moment by the heartlessness of this stranger&rsquo;s advice, deep down, I knew his remark had some merit.</p>
<p>In a world constantly on the verge of annoyance and hostility, was staying back when I knew everything was fine a mistake? I didn&rsquo;t have the courage that day to find the answer. After all, #life had to happen.</p>

<p>It has never been my experience with iCloud - sync takes ages in the always-connected cloud world of today. Especially when I compare it with Dropbox and Google Cloud, the services that I use.</p>
<p>I am a big, big fan of Dropbox. The service has got the perfect balance of functionality and performance. <em>Everything just works</em>.</p>

			 <p>I have always disliked the apps that provide you with a 15-minute summary of the books, usually non-fiction books. Such services are reviewed well and people seem to be paying for them. For example, <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/">Blinkist</a>. Here&rsquo;s whom this service claims to be built for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for curious people who love to learn, busy people who don’t have time to read, and even people who aren’t into reading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get this. What&rsquo;s the fun in listening to a 15-minute summary of books? Even podcasts, they claim?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to not be into reading books. One isn&rsquo;t really missing anything if they don&rsquo;t read books &ndash; the information will find its way to reach them. Why, then, the farce of reading books through summaries?</p>
<p>With the rise of ChatGPT and likes, services now don&rsquo;t even want people to read articles on the web. For example, <a href="https://resources.arc.net/en/articles/8399405-arc-max">the latest update for Arc browser</a> launched a new feature called 5-second preview where one can &ldquo;<em>press Shift and hover over any link to generate a summary of the webpage, without a single click</em>&rdquo;. This is not good as it can potentially kill people&rsquo;s (already dwindling) interest in visiting other websites.</p>
<p>Why are we so against any form of reading in the original voice?</p>

			 <p>Every day that I don&rsquo;t write makes writing again more difficult. I don&rsquo;t because I convince myself what I write next needs to be significant. <em>I don&rsquo;t have anything meaningful to talk about</em>. Why does it need to be meaningful? And meaningful for whom?</p>
<p>The most meaningful thing I do is live my life. Isn&rsquo;t everything happening to me, around me, of the most importance? Why won&rsquo;t, then, #writing about it be meaningful? It is to me and that&rsquo;s all that should matter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t write for readers to find meaning in what I have written. I <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2021/10/08/why-do-i.html">write</a> to calm myself down. I write to focus.</p>
<p>No surprise then that every time I stop writing, I am more unsettled. The <em>restlessness</em> is not the cause of my block. It&rsquo;s the effect.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t know how to be social. I can&rsquo;t use the social media tools. I am a user of many. I don&rsquo;t use any. Or to be fair, I don&rsquo;t know how to use them. I would passively scroll through the timeline and yet not respond to any of the posts. Not that I don&rsquo;t want to. However, I don&rsquo;t know what to say. Or how to say it.</p>
<p>I feel awkward interacting with people I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s who an introvert is.</p>
<p>Even in real life, I take time to comfortably open up with others. I am that silent, awkward guy hanging around in a group. Not knowing who and how to talk to someone.</p>
<p>No wonder then I feel the same discomfort in the digital space. What troubles me is I just end up wasting time not using these tools in the manner they are supposed to be used. I don&rsquo;t benefit in any way by using the services.</p>
<p>So why am I even on these social media sites then?</p>

<p>Email newsletters were intended to address the problems of “RSS feeds” by consolidating all the information in your inbox. They aimed to streamline reading and information consumption.</p>

<p>I control what I subscribe to. I am not a completionist, so I often mark all as read. I unsubscribe aggressively. Plus, like Om, I keep Newsletters far away from emails and use Feedbin.</p>
<p>This has helped me keep the newsletter issues in check and not become a burden.</p>

			 <p>I like rating things, though I don&rsquo;t do it often. I used to follow the standard star rating &ndash; rating stuff one of five stars. At times, I even went into the scale of half.</p>
<p>I slowly realized that it is not a good scale for how my mind works. It&rsquo;s too much work and the trouble of finding an accurate star that captures how I feel was enough to deter me from reviewing at all.</p>
<p>I am changing how I rate things now to a different scale &ndash; either I like it or don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s simpler and no longer a mental hurdle.</p>
<p>How about a third option in between when I neither like nor dislike something? A &ldquo;meh&rdquo; maybe? Well, that&rsquo;s why the second scale is not &ldquo;dislike&rdquo;. It says <em>I did not like it</em>.</p>
<p>If it is not a confident yes, it&rsquo;s a no. A two-scale rating covers that range.</p>

			 <p>My daughter was writing in her journal today and casually asked me why she does not see me writing in my journal anymore. She was referring to a physical journal that she would see me writing in frequently a while back. I didn&rsquo;t have an easy answer for her, to be frank.</p>
<p>I said first that I write in my digital journal now &ndash; after all, I do have a Day One subscription, and it prompts me every day to make an entry. Do I always make one? Well, rarely. I haven&rsquo;t updated my journal <em>with anything meaningful</em> for quite some time now. Journaling isn&rsquo;t part of my routine anymore. So, I have slowly stopped doing it.</p>
<p>I was regular when I had made it my morning habit. The routine changed and so died my habit.</p>
<p>Leaving me in that deep thought, my daughter went on to scribble happily in her journal. Once she was done, she said, &ldquo;I love how I feel when I capture everything on my mind in these pages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even I want that now.</p>

			 <p>When I created <a href="https://scribe.amitg.net/">Scribe</a>, the idea was to make it work fully client-side &ndash; everything works from my browser. I intended to keep myself in check, to build only the simple, must-have features. It is good that I took that decision; otherwise, I would go down a rabbit hole supporting everything I want to. A lot is missing currently, I know. I have also heard a lot that others suggested.</p>
<p>But to be frank, I don&rsquo;t know where to start. I can&rsquo;t support many of the requests without a server-side component &ndash; for example, handling images. What&rsquo;s that one feature that is the most glaring miss? I have been using the editor for over a week without issue, other than a few styling fixes.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I am open to feature requests (and even pull requests) though. So, if there&rsquo;s a feature you want to see supported, do <a href="https://github.com/am1t/scribe/issues/new">create a new issue</a>.</p>

			 <p>I had <a href="https://amitg.blog/always-visible">recently quipped here</a> that we might see an increasing number of posts suggesting to other people what and how to blog. Here&rsquo;s what I said then.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Twitter and Facebook dropping in popularity, I expect blogging to attract a few new users as an outlet for their voice. And I also expect the pundits to pollute the internet again with their suggestions on the best ways to blog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, I went on to suggest what people should do while blogging. The irony, much?</p>
<p>My intention wasn&rsquo;t to do so, though. Instead, I wanted people to not worry about any of that stuff, especially while they are getting started blogging. Over the years, I have written about anything and everything. Hot sarcastic takes. Fiction. Technology. Personal essays. I wrote them all.</p>
<p>Many people suggest that one should stick to a specific area if they want more people to read what they write. It&rsquo;s better if that area is niche. Well, nothing kills a writer&rsquo;s motivation faster than the voice at the back of the mind continuously questioning if they should write what they are writing in the first place. If anyone will read them. That writer will bear that voice a few times but then realize it&rsquo;s too much trouble. And soon stop writing.</p>
<p>So, long back, I decided I wouldn&rsquo;t judge what I write or where I publish it. Nothing matters as long as I want it to be published. That includes who reads it. Or if anyone does at all.</p>
<p>I have accepted now that the only thing I control is the words. Everything else is external, outside of my control. So why worry about that?</p>

			 <p>I have been working on an editor for Micro.blog that has a simple interface and works well even for long-form writing. I have written this post from what I call <a href="https://scribe.amitg.net/">Scribe</a>, a clean web-based editor that can post to Micro.blog.</p>
<p>This is a focused writing space with an editor that <em>completely works on the client side</em>. What I write is auto-saved locally. I can save the same to Micro.blog as a draft to be edited later there. Or I can post it to go live on my blog. There is a word/character counter and dark mode. And it also works on mobile.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not the first post I have published with Scribe &ndash; I have been using this for the past couple of days, fixing all the issues, big and small. Now, you can also try it out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing else to explain. Just get writing and sign in to Micro.blog, if you like it.</p>

We visited <a href="https://www.amazeum.in/">a children&rsquo;s museum</a> and had a blast playing and having fun together.</p>

<p>For example, I was today wondering what movie a particular scene was from. Bard <a href="https://g.co/bard/share/07b568f5e69e">got the answer</a> bang on. A search engine never got this right for me.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t read a more frustrating book than <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53139064-the-eighth-detective">The Eighth Detective</a> by Alex Pavesi. It has a smart premise. Pavesi was aiming to attempt something pretty unique. But then I feel he got distracted by the lure of surprising readers. The twists and turns were too many to keep the book coherent. There are no characters to connect with. No story that captures your attention. The seven stories narrated by the lead character are silly. The twists are sillier. And are one too many. It was frustrating to see a clever premise wasted through controlled writing.</p>
<p>At the same time, I haven&rsquo;t heard many better narration performances than by Emilia Fox. She is extremely natural while voice acting in both stories and dialogues. I could visualize every character distinctly just through her voice.</p>
<p>The last time I was this impressed by someone&rsquo;s narration was when I listened to <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2022/04/17/i-cant-remember.html">Ray Porter narrate Project Hail Mary</a>. Absolutely fantastic!</p>

			 <p>Early mornings always play a significant role in my routine. I love the vibe all around during the dawn. The calmness. The silence. The hustle and bustle of morning service boys with their newspapers and milk packets.</p>
<p>The surroundings wake up around me, and I love to be the spectator.</p>
<p>Nature looks to be shrugging off the dormancy from the night before. Birds get busy early. Chirping. Waking each other up. Or already playing? Who can say? Trees sway lethargically with a smile, like a sane grandmother in a busy home. The breeze caresses me like a loving mother &ndash; I can almost fall asleep again.</p>
<p>Never a night owl, I couldn&rsquo;t stay awake beyond a reasonable time, even during my hostel days. Those were the days when staying up all night was normal. A sign of a happy student even. While my friends used to blast off into the night with their choice of rock music, I lay on my bed in deep slumber. Frequently, my friends and I had breakfast together &ndash; the only difference was that they were depleted on their way to bed, and I was chirpy post my deep sleep.</p>
<p>In the recent past, my morning routine has been hectic, not allowing me to live the calmness I so adore. Today I paused for a moment and stood looking out at the wakening surrounding.</p>
<p>A moment of life around. Of nothingness within. Of memories galore.</p>

			 <p>I keep my writing simple while conveying my thoughts. It is the most effective way that I know. I learnt this from all the people I enjoy reading online. But Derek Sivers has been the most significant influence.</p>
<p>There was a time when I liked to ornament my writing with unnecessary words. A lot of context. Too many adjectives. Metaphors.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do that anymore as it is unwarranted for my kind of #writing. I don&rsquo;t want to pen the most beautiful piece of prose. Or be creative with the use and selection of words. I write to convey my ideas and that needs just clarity. <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/i-am-not-a-writer">Manu says this</a> while sharing why he feels he is not a writer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What matters here is not the writing, is the communication. Is the exchange of ideas, and the sharing of experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I relate to this thought. As long as what I want to say is unambiguous, and is understood without trouble by the reader, my goal behind <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2021/10/08/why-do-i.html">why I write</a> is met. The length of the post or my vernacular does not matter.</p>

			 <p>Threads reminded me of why I eventually fell off the Twitter timeline. It&rsquo;s the same people talking about the same stuff they always do. The early adopters, the famous bloggers, and podcasters. The social media celebrities. They have a bubble of their own. They talk amongst themselves as you listen. You are not part of any community &ndash; you are watching a show.</p>
<p>Then there are the posts that are written mainly to go viral. The memes. The questions. The jokes. And the jokers. The social media diarrhoea.</p>
<p>These threads (pun unintended) garner the most engagement, which makes the algorithmic timeline bubble them to the top. Now, these are all I see. And I don&rsquo;t enjoy either of them.</p>
<p>The diversity of both the posts and the people is also why I love the timeline on Micro.blog. It&rsquo;s never the same people or the same type of posts that crowd the place. And if they do, I know how to correct that.</p>

			 <p>Recently, I have seen many people get nostalgic about Google Reader. The argument is that if Google Reader hadn&rsquo;t died, the internet wouldn&rsquo;t have been in the dire state it is today. As if the demise of Google Reader caused the rise of proprietary timelines of Twitter and Facebook. Unfortunately, it was the other way around.</p>
<p>Plus, Google Reader was a flawed, terribly designed, niche product only used by a handful of tech-savvy people. I say this even though I was a big fan of the product. It could never have survived in the form it was in.</p>
<p>Sure, web browsing does feel horrible today, as Tim Sweeney of Epic <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1674860397617111059">tweeted</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The internet feels increasingly broken. News sites are paywalled or account walled, Reddit is nag walled, Google search spams ads and SEO to the point of uselessness, and now Twitter is account walled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with all of it. But I don&rsquo;t think Google Reader could have addressed any of it. RSS, for sure, cannot. It&rsquo;s just a standard to simplify consumption. The problem lies at the source.</p>

			 <p>I am frustrated with my recent tendency to choose the easy option whenever an opportunity arrives. Watch rather than read. Read rather than write. Get tired doing both. And then sleep. I am doing this way too often these days. I have <a href="https://log.amitg.net/?date=2023-06-30#p1">made this my routine</a>. I am aware this behaviour isn&rsquo;t good. But I still do this.</p>
<p>Passively scroll through the news. Or YouTube shorts. And when I feel bad about my choice, I skim through my RSS feeds. Or newsletters. I attempt to fool my mind that I am reading the good stuff, following a good routine. I very well know that I am fooling no one. Especially not my mind. It continues to feel shit.</p>
<p>There was a time when I would take steps to correct the habits of bad choices. Move away from my smartphone. Uninstall apps. Or disable notifications. Track. Measure. Force me towards, or give me more opportunities to make better choices.</p>
<p>What pains me is I have stopped doing any of that, either. Every wasted day ends with a promise that I will start following a good routine from tomorrow. For that matter, routine of some sort, as I lack any at this point.</p>
<p>Weeks have gone by, but that tomorrow hasn&rsquo;t arrived yet. I am afraid it never will if I don&rsquo;t take measures promptly. Being aware is useless if I don&rsquo;t act.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to write for the last few days. Or has it been months? I have no idea any more. I did quip now and then. But to me, that does not count. Life kept me busy, and my inclination to think dries up whenever that happens. If I ain&rsquo;t thinking, writing I am not.</p>
<p>I hate this behaviour of mine. Why must I be in a routine to find time or energy to write? It isn&rsquo;t as if the words dry out. I just can&rsquo;t put them out.</p>
<p>A possible answer is that <em>I love my comfort zone</em>. Anything out of the ordinary and I shut my brain down. I can&rsquo;t think. I can&rsquo;t do anything that I routinely do. Or so I convince myself. I enter a shell waiting for things to get back to normal. Waiting for me to find my comfort zone again. And then, and only then, do I begin living again.</p>
<p>Until then, I find cheap getaways. Scroll through YouTube. Or news. Rewatching already watched shows. <em>Feel tired</em>. Sleep a lot.</p>
<p>Such a menacing beast this comfort zone is. It makes me feel comfortable with and in control of my life. Yet soon, the same control shackles me down to the routine. The lack of stress the routine brings suffocates me. Stagnates me. Am I then even alive any more?</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been watching Seinfeld&rsquo;s reruns recently, and one device has always puzzled me. The phone machine. It is a critical element in almost every episode and plays a central part in a few. And yet I have never owned such a device.</p>
<p>A landline was itself a luxury while I was growing up. Very few homes in the neighbourhood had them. Even we got it pretty late. I remember when we eventually did, our house became a switchboard, and we were the telephone operators—connecting folks all over to ones in our neighbourhood.</p>
<p>We received calls at home and took the messages. Sometimes, my parents held the line while I, being the only kid in the house, ran to the neighbour&rsquo;s home to invite them to receive the phone call.</p>
<p>It was all fun, to be frank. It felt good to hear the stories after the phone call. No one left away without sharing what the call was all about. A few wanted to add more context to what we unintentionally heard on one heard by narrating what was said on the other. It all felt customary.</p>
<p>We never had an answering machine. There was no way to leave a message for us while we were away. So instead, I was the answering machine for others while <em>they</em> were away.</p>
<p>Also, I am not sure I would be comfortable using such machines. I could never convey the message on the spot in short. All I would say is, &ldquo;Call me back&rdquo;. What else can one say without rambling on and on?</p>
<p>So when I see these machines screw up the main characters' lives in the shows like Seinfeld and Friends, I only chuckle. You know, I have been an answering machine, and we tend to screw up.</p>

			 <p>Writing should not be boring. If that happens to me, it means that I am doing it forcefully or that I do it out of habit. Yet, in either case, I won&rsquo;t stop writing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t write because I <em>have to</em>. I write because I <em>have something to say</em>. That&rsquo;s why I cannot write on a schedule. Sure, I can sit in front of the screen and wait for the words to turn up. They generally do, which is why I have been a blogger for around 15 years. But I cannot force them to.</p>
<p>There are times when I write every day, multiple times a day. And then weeks go by, and I hardly publish anything.</p>
<p>This reminds me of a curious thought from James Clear. While talking about achieving mastery, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">he says</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mastery requires practice. But the more you practice something, the more boring and routine it becomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It makes me wonder - can creativity be routine and boring? I hope not. Maybe that&rsquo;s the reason one can never master an art form. They are always learning. The same applies to writing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t intend to master writing. All I want is to share my thoughts through words.</p>

			 <p>While working on <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2023/04/21/a-blog-no.html">my blog&rsquo;s recent redesign</a>, I decided not to display the date/time as part of the post. Sure, I am not the only one who does that.</p>
<p>Although debatable, I find that detail useless for my type of writing, and I was ridding the interface of every element that wasn&rsquo;t essential. I don&rsquo;t write posts which are relevant only to a particular period. I am not writing news articles that will go stale. Plus, if there&rsquo;s an article that forms the context for a post, I explicitly link to that.</p>
<p>So why does it matter when the words are written? I stand by and am even proud of every post I have written. Short or long. On the contrary, I don&rsquo;t want the age of the post to impact what it says. It&rsquo;s still me saying that. Just younger. It is the same reason I <a href="https://amitg.blog/what-do-i-call-the-entries-that-i-write-here">don&rsquo;t correct</a> my old posts.</p>
<p>I have also seen people put a disclaimer on old posts saying it may not reflect one&rsquo;s current views. Colin <a href="https://colinwalker.blog/blog/?date=2023-03-19#p1">puts such a disclaimer</a> on his older posts and writes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just because I may not think a certain way, however, doesn&rsquo;t mean that I can&rsquo;t be proud of what I have previously written — some of it is among my best writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with Colin. But for the same reason, I don&rsquo;t want to put any such disclaimer. Isn&rsquo;t it obvious that one&rsquo;s perspective towards things changes over time? Why call it out, then?</p>
<p>I accept that not showing the date is extreme. After all, I still include the date in the source and RSS feeds. But removing a detail is the best way to determine if it is essential. And currently, I am all for a reset.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A few months back, I responded to Om Malik&rsquo;s thoughts on the importance of stream of posts on one&rsquo;s blog. Here&rsquo;s what <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2023/01/31/does-the-stream.html">I proposed</a> we bloggers should do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recommend stuff to the reader on our platform, our blogs. On our home pages. And around our posts. But instead of letting AI decide, let&rsquo;s curate these recommendations manually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have since wanted to update my website, my primary home on the web, to do away with the standard design principle for a blog. Why does every home page have to look a certain way? Pages after pages of reverse chronological lists of posts.</p>
<p>I recently quipped that blogs have made the web boring. That every blog looks the same. All themes are more or less the same. A slight layout change here. A margin or padding there. Varied columns. But all look the same to me. You know that you are reading a blog.</p>
<p>I wanted to stop doing that. I want to curate the experience for the readers. Worst case, for the one reader that&rsquo;s me. So, I have been working on laying out the structure for this space afresh<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A home page recommends a selection of posts. No page&rsquo;s a reverse chronological list. Even if a reader visits one that&rsquo;s supposed to be, for example, <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/archive">archive</a>, they won&rsquo;t see a list. Every page allows a search and an option to visit a random post. A prominent nav bar allows navigation around every post. There are a lot of other minor touches sprinkled across.</p>
<p>Plus <em>there are colours</em>. Minimal doesn&rsquo;t mean black and white. Minimal can have personality. It does now.</p>
<p>Satisfied after playing around and iterating with the changes for a couple of days, I applied the layout to the site today. Once I did, I wondered if this space was a typical blog any more. As per Wikipedia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A blog is an informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not a diary. No reverse chronological order. And yet I don&rsquo;t care. To me, a blog is what a blogger wants it to be. And I am done with the stream of posts. So here&rsquo;s to a bold new start.</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I do maintain and actively publish at a traditional blog and the nav bar points to that. Irony much?&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>

			 <p>I have a fascinating relationship with Mondays. There&rsquo;s some charm to the first day of the week as if it dawns with a responsibility to set things right. With a new zeal not to carry the mistakes from the week gone by.</p>
<p>To follow the routine. To focus on the work. To get back to life.</p>
<p>With responsibility comes pressure. The pressure of all the things undone in the last week and pushed to the next. Pushed out with the hope that the first day of the following week would be different. Better. It never is.</p>
<p>I usually want to get back to all the right habits on Mondays. Why do so on any other day? In the middle of a week? Right? I remember we, friends, once had a running joke where we would answer any suggestion of starting something healthy with &ldquo;let&rsquo;s start on Monday&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Gym? <em>Let&rsquo;s start on Monday.</em> Stop eating junk food? <em>Let&rsquo;s start on Monday.</em> Read more? &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This habit of waiting for Monday to start something different, something good, has stuck with me. Funny how bad habits die hard.</p>

			 <p>I generally find it easy to write about meta topics around my writing process. Or platforms. Among the people I read online, the behaviour is common. At the same time, I&rsquo;m not too fond of these meta posts. All I am doing is convincing myself why the choice of a platform is the right one. No one cares about them.</p>
<p>Will I ever run out of places where I can write at? I won&rsquo;t. Can I ever have enough of them? Never. Should I write about all of them? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>Holding oneself back from writing about a particular topic is antithetical to the spirit of blogging, where no topic is beyond the bounds.</p>
<p>But writing about every experiment lends me a false sense of achievement. I write because I want to think better. I write because I want to improve my writing skill. Writing mindlessly about my experiments doesn&rsquo;t help me with either of those. Hence I don&rsquo;t write meta posts any longer.</p>
<p>Or so I think. Ironically, this itself is a meta post.</p>

			 <p>It is the phase when I reevaluate my use of all the services I am subscribed to. Of course, my email client is one of the key ones on the list. I was an early Gmail account holder and have been an ardent user since then. But when Gmail got old, I never loved email. It got boring and tiring.</p>
<p>Recently, I realised that I love sending and receiving emails. But I wouldn&rsquo;t say I like Gmail.</p>
<p>iCloud was handling my custom email domain. But as I am not all in on the Apple ecosystem &ndash; with my Android and Linux &ndash; the experience with iCloud Mail is terrible. In short, I had to find a new solution for my personal and custom email domains.</p>
<p>I started with a trial of Fastmail, and I was unimpressed. No doubt, the email service is brilliant. It&rsquo;s no-nonsense and has everything that an email power user would want. Nothing more and just the way an email service should work. I, however, am not a power user. Nor do I love the experience that the typical email services provide. I needed something different to rekindle my love for email.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I was reminded of HEY. The last time I tried it, I loved the service but didn&rsquo;t need it. Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2020/07/05/215535.html">what I wrote</a> while ending the trial.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All in all, HEY is a brilliant service with a fresh perspective towards the way we use our emails. It can potentially enliven the email offerings from all the players, just the away Gmail did back in 2004. But I don&rsquo;t face the problem it is trying to solve; I have no use for all its groundbreaking features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do I think I need it now? Well, to be frank. I still don&rsquo;t. But I am falling in love with email again, and HEY&rsquo;s unique take on how email should be done should help me stay en route. So, here&rsquo;s to a new start for emails.</p>

			 <p>I enjoy <a href="https://amitg.blog/evening-walks-are-cheerful-again">my evening walks</a> with Snoopy. This guy continues to get all the attention from folks I have never met. I often hear someone call out his name, run to him, play with him and walk away with a smile. <em>Completely ignoring my presence</em>. As if I don&rsquo;t exist. Such is the charm of cuteness, I believe.</p>
<p>He has also made new friends. He knows where he will find them. He walks to the place and waits for them to come to him. These are the regulars.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a corner towards the end of our walk that both of us adore. It&rsquo;s usually quiet. A cold breeze always flows through. It&rsquo;s neither too light to expose us nor too dark to hide us. I make sure we halt there and sit next to each other. Nothing in my hand. Nothing on my mind. <em>Nothingness</em>. A bare moment of a void. Amidst the bustling #life.</p>
<p>And I like to believe Snoopy feels the same. Unperturbed. Many people walk by, but no one disturbs us. Maybe they acknowledge the tranquillity we feel.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s walk was no different. And yet was slightly different. After sitting through the quiet moments, I realized it was a full moon in the sky. Pink moon. It looked big, majestic. My hand went to my pocket to pull my smartphone out as it often does. I wanted to take a picture of the magnificence I was looking at. I wanted to capture the moment.</p>
<p>How futile was the thought? The day there exists a technology that can capture such moments of calmness, their significance will dwindle. Such moments are rare; they need to be lived and felt. And in that feeling, in that rarity, lies their essence.</p>

			 <p>Am I writing enough? Am I writing too much? I cared a lot about these two questions in my early blogging days some 15 years ago. At that time, blog pundits filled the internet with suggestions on the posting schedule or the posts' length. With Twitter and Facebook dominating soon, all those suggestions became futile.</p>
<p>As online presence became a popularity contest, a burst of short meaningless quips became the norm.</p>
<p>Throw more at the wall, and something will stick.</p>
<p>I could never play the social media game. It needed the zeal to always stay connected. I instead felt burdened by the pressure of participating non-stop. No surprise, then, that I kept writing on my blog. A lot less frequently, but I did.</p>
<p>With Twitter and Facebook dropping in popularity, I expect blogging to attract a few new users as an outlet for their voice. And I also expect the pundits to pollute the internet again with their suggestions on the best ways to blog.</p>
<p>Let me spill the beans. There isn&rsquo;t one.</p>
<p>Write anything. Write anytime. Write anywhere.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about followers. Don&rsquo;t worry about likes and reposts. There aren&rsquo;t any. Some see this as a limitation &ndash; <a href="https://amitg.blog/today-i-began-reading-writing-is-my-drink-by-theo-pauline-nestor">I find it liberating</a>.</p>

<p>When spectacle and larger-than-life characters are ruling the movie screens and box offices, such a heartwrenching yet endearing story shouldn&rsquo;t be missed. If you have read the book, watch it for Hanks&rsquo;s portrayal of Ove. If you haven&rsquo;t, you <em>must</em> watch it for everything.</p>

			 <p>A day that dawned with many promises ended with a list of letdowns. I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to work on the tasks that I wanted to work on. Other&rsquo;s <a href="https://amitg.blog/today-got-as-frustrating-as-the-working-days-can-get-shaking-my-confidence-in">priorities</a> polluting my calendar - the usual stuff.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, a few people carry an attitude which only mars the team&rsquo;s morale and, eventually, their productivity.</p>
<p>It is one thing to <em>believe</em> you are smart. It is another to <em>assume</em> the others are dumb. The former shows confidence, later callousness.</p>
<p>The only saving grace is that it&rsquo;s the start of the weekend.</p>

			 <p>What do I call the entries that I write here? Notes? Posts? Thoughts? Or does that even matter? This is my blog, a space, <a href="https://amitg.blog/whats-this-space">as I noted earlier</a>, for the &ldquo;quick posts journaling whatever is at the top of my mind&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t call them quick posts because they are less formal. Instead, they are less formal because I want them to be. Because I write them as short, quick posts. They need not be correct. They need not be <em>corrected</em>.</p>
<p>Manu <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts-on-an-unpolished-note">wrote recently</a> about how he dislikes editing old blog content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A] personal blog can and should be a representation of who you are at different points in time. We change, we grow and our thoughts and ideas grow and change with us. And it&rsquo;s important to have testament of that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I, too, am firmly in Manu&rsquo;s camp. If I were to <em>improve</em> my old posts, I would never write anything new. The ideas are shitty, and the way I wrote them is shittier. Nevertheless, I still stand by all of those posts. Sure, I may not endorse any of those views today. But they are the views of my younger self.</p>
<p>The world around me has changed over the years. So has the world within me. It is only natural then that how I look at and understand the world has evolved too.</p>
<p>I recently observed my writing may have gained <a href="https://amitg.blog/i-read-a-post-today-that-i-had-written-around-15-years-ago">correctness at the cost of courage</a>. Colin had <a href="https://colinwalker.blog/blog/?date=2023-03-15#p4">an interesting thought</a> responding to the post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about it being a lack of courage, rather an increased reticence stemming from a low-level, underlying fear that now pervades the web.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it the fear of being wrong that has made me change what and how I write? Sure, that too. Whatever the reason, I am not the same self I was a few years ago. Why, then, should I ever correct what he thought and wrote? It helps neither the reader nor me.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Get to the point. I remember those words every time I write anything.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is to focus on how I begin my posts. Matthew Dicks <a href="https://matthewdicks.com/beginnings-matter-a-lot/">reminded me</a> about the importance of this today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Focus on the first thing you write, say, or sing. Spend time making the absolute best decision about those first few things you are going to express. Never forget their importance to everything that will come after.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was (and still am) bad at this aspect for years. I circle what I want to say before I say what I want to say. Over years of writing, I got better at this. I come to the point quicker now.</p>
<p>I feel frustrated when I see some of the most personal stuff with an interesting premise get lost in need of setting context. Many writings need context setting. Research papers need context. Thesis. How-to Manuals. And on and on.</p>
<p>But a personal blog does not. Sure, some stories need a build-up; take the reader along the ride. But most don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>On the other hand, does there even need for an &ldquo;effective way&rdquo; of writing anything personal? It&rsquo;s personal, after all. Individual. There&rsquo;s no correct way of doing it. It&rsquo;s a matter of style.</p>
<p>But what counts is not to lose the reader before I arrive at the point. So begin strong.</p>

			 <p>I watched <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kuttey">Kuttey</a> yesterday &ndash; what a terrible letdown. Given the list of artists as part of the cast and crew, I had such high expectations. But the skill of being a competent storyteller cannot be faked. It tried too hard to be cool, &ldquo;new age&rdquo;. Every frame screamed that it was inspired by the style of Guy Ritchie or Tarantino. Or even Bharadwaj&rsquo;s own Kaminey.</p>
<p>What the Jr. forgot is it isn&rsquo;t the style that made these directors what they are.</p>
<p>Everybody was trying too hard &ndash; even the seasoned actors looked uncomfortable playing the part. A short run-time of 90 minutes felt too long, even though the screenplay was fast-paced. I kept moving ahead scene after scene because I knew exactly how it would play out.</p>
<p>Barring the last 15 minutes, hardly any part catches your attention. Sigh! Such sheer waste of talent.</p>

			 <p>I read a post today that I had written around 15 years ago. Reading my words from yesteryears, especially from my early days of blogging, reminds me every time how fearless I was in expressing what I had in mind. Not everything I wrote made sense. But it wasn&rsquo;t bogged down by a fear of correctness.</p>
<p>Correctness of idea. Of language. Of grammar. Of words.</p>
<p>Is my #writing susceptible to that fear now? I hope not because, to me, it needs to be free-flowing. Sure, I am more alert to the mistakes in my use of the language. Or of words. But that&rsquo;s bound to happen naturally over years of reading and writing.</p>
<p>This reminds me of a nice quote from an Indian actor I respect, Pankaj Tripathi. He was talking about how fame and money have changed the artist in him. An artist, he said, is much more courageous and adventurous when they are new and lack money. Their experience, popularity and earnings make them powerful but timid.</p>
<p>I believe the same applies to one&rsquo;s experience with writing words. What I gained in correctness, I likely lost in courage.</p>
<p>So, which version of the self do I enjoy reading more? I like to believe that my writing has improved over these years. I am no master, but I am not an amateur either. Even though I am not the same fearless blogger from the past, I don&rsquo;t mind this slightly mindful version of myself.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One productivity hack I have read the most often is just to get started. Not to wait for inspiration or motivation. Not to procrastinate. Even with writing, or any art form, many often allude to the importance of blank canvas.</p>
<p>Stare at the page; one&rsquo;s mind will soon start filling it up with colours. Or words, in my case.</p>
<p>It has worked for me, too, for the last few weeks. The posts eventually happen when I make myself available in front of the laptop. With me travelling and visiting my cousins for the last few days, no surprise they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It was a welcome and <em>much-needed</em> break. I visited Mumbai, a place that I have a love-hate relationship with.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I love spending time with my cousins. The togetherness lends me a reset when I can forget all the stress and burdens of daily #life. Over the food we love and the memories that we chatter about. As time passes, the animated environment gives way to moments of real connection. As individuals find corners where they catch up on others' lives, I get surrounded by mumbles. But soon, as someone invariably gets hungry, everyone regroups, and the surroundings get filled with laughter again. This cycle continues throughout the day and late into the night.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s more comforting than spending time with people you bond with.</p>
<p>But then I hate Mumbai when I need to visit the city. It&rsquo;s too lively for my liking. Everyone&rsquo;s moving too fast. Every place is too crowded. No one has time to pause. And if I do, I face a lot of glares from the Mumbaikars. This includes my cousins too. <em>Why the hell will you do that - stop?</em></p>
<p>Some cities want you to pause and absorb their essence. Mumbai is not that city. It wants, <em>needs</em> you to match up with its speed. I struggle to do that. And I struggled this time, too. I returned home exhausted, drenched with the pressure of meeting the city&rsquo;s high lifestyle standards.</p>
<p>As I lay tired in bed, there was a moment when I attempted to push myself to publish something. Anything. But I have already conceded that this place won&rsquo;t follow a schedule. This place isn&rsquo;t a journal that I need to update daily. This place isn&rsquo;t a newsletter that needs to stick to a schedule. This place is my blank canvas.</p>

			 <p>I attempted to watch Netflix&rsquo;s new docuseries &ldquo;MH370: The Plane That Disappeared&rdquo; - and it&rsquo;s absolutely terrible. It gives focus to too many characters, goes all over the places and never returns back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s the story they want to tell. It&rsquo;s not what happened to the plane or who is responsible or even how it affected the people related to the passengers on-board. It tries to do all of it and does half-assed job at each.</p>
<p>I would recommend listening to the podcast episode on this topic by <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1oWeqQp4wW88wGD6ka8fqa?si=9LAZb3LYQrSs_kWdIfbvlg&amp;app_destination=copy-link">Stuff You Should Know</a>. They do a far better job at explaining the mystery than this supposed to be well-produced documentary by Netflix.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I had heard a folktale as a child that I still love. The morale it narrates is loosely translated as &ldquo;an entire tub full cannot retrieve what the drop took away&rdquo;. But the real takeaway from the tale was to be wary of one&rsquo;s instinctive reactions.</p>
<p>The spontaneous reactions taken in anger are as instinctive as instinctive can get. In that sense, anger is destructive. Rebounding from the aftermath that an angry reaction leaves behind is no painless task. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much one attempts to recover what was lost; the scarred mind cannot be easily healed.</p>
<p>Because anger scars both people, even the one who gets angry.</p>
<p>Hence I have moulded myself to not give in to the instinct when angry. I remind myself that my brain is muddled, and the best action I can take is to walk away and take a few deep breaths. It avoids ruining the remaining day for the other person and me.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t recover. Resist.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Today got as frustrating as the working days can get, shaking my confidence in my capabilities to the core. As I signed off for the day, I was left numb.</p>
<p>I toiled hard, but the circumstances fought back stronger. Key people went on unplanned leave. Approvals got delayed. Core systems faced unplanned downtimes. Folks got under undue pressure, and they began rubbing it off others.</p>
<p>The last one on the list of unfortunate events above is the worse. I hate when people do that.</p>
<p>Work one gets assigned can be delegated. Shared. Pressure shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>I am generally a lot more organized while handling my tasks with a clear goal for the day. But it gets frustrating when people pollute <em>my day</em> with <em>their</em> priorities. When they devalue my time because they can&rsquo;t value theirs.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s even more frustrating is that in a corporate world, there&rsquo;s just no way out of this at times.</p>
<p>As the day progressed, I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of tasks left untouched, the tasks that I should have worked on instead. The third day running of missed daily goals and the list keeps piling up.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed, tomorrow dawns better. That I manage to put my head down and pull my messed-up productivity out of the rut.</p>

			 <p>Silence is golden. Amidst friends, it is not.</p>
<p>It was Holi today, and I was surrounded by friends or people I knew once as friends. Yet there was hardly anyone I could walk up to and converse with without things getting awkward pretty soon. I knew then that some threads were broken within us. Some memories were lost. Some part of me was forgotten.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t be too self-critical by blaming myself. Such has been the #life for the last few years that there has hardly been time to peer beyond the bounds of the close family.</p>
<p>The pandemic locked us in our houses. And we forgot what we had left out.</p>
<p>I have been attempting to come back to normalcy slowly. It was exactly a year ago when I reconnected with my extended family. My cousins. It was the same occasion as today when I&rsquo;d welcomed them home. We&rsquo;d made some of the best memories and relived them again today.</p>
<p>Memories. Such a remarkable aspect of our lives this is. Say it aloud, and many would come rushing at you, leaving you drenched with giddiness.</p>
<p>Many did come rushing at me today. Memories from yesteryears when I had spent some wonderful moments with these people around me. But instead of leaving me giddy, they left me wretched. Miserable. Angry that I let the threads break. Break they did because friendship needs holding on to &ndash; the tighter you do, the stronger it grows.</p>
<p>I aim to correct this - I won&rsquo;t remain silent when I meet these folks for Holi the next year.</p>

I was contributing anyway just for the sake of contributing &ndash; photos are not something I enjoy. I love taking photos, but I am not a master photographer. So why even try doing something daily that I don&rsquo;t enjoy?</p>
<p>So neither didn&rsquo;t I click a snap nor upload it.</p>
<p>I am also extremely tired today to spend any time writing significant nightly updates. So today, a quick observation will have to do.</p>
<p>I do not enjoy maintaining streaks. I do not enjoy taking photos without purpose. When tired, I cannot write anything profound. Or I cannot write. Period.</p>

			 <p>I have too many hobbies or interests that I want to undertake, much more than my schedule allows. I enjoy reading articles from the feeds/newsletters I subscribe to, reading/listening to books, interacting with social media posts, writing and coding on small projects. Even if I club the first three above as reading, it leaves me with many options. I am not even counting the unplanned movie show or wish to doodle. Today I decided I want to address this.</p>
<p>As I scoured the internet (mainly Reddit and YouTube) to find the solution to this not-so-uncommon problem, one suggestion I kept hitting against was to reduce the list. As Cal Newport <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf_UVP_z47Q">suggests</a>, I should have a primary and a secondary hobby. Anything more than that and &ldquo;the overhead counterbalances the value the activity brings.</p>
<p>So what do I want to get rid of?</p>
<p>I do not think reading is something I can stop doing. I enjoy reading this, that and everything. After many trials, I have finally arrived at an effective setup for my reading process. Someday I will go into the details of this setup. But overall, I do not want to eliminate any of that.</p>
<p>Is writing even a hobby anymore? I do this as part of my daily routine and a winding down activity. I need not find time for this. I already have. And hence even this ain&rsquo;t a problem.</p>
<p>So how do I juggle everything I want but haven&rsquo;t got time to pick? The search for a solution continues.</p>

			 <p>I have stopped using YouTube on my phone for quite some time now. Even my iPad and laptop, I use it very carefully. I do not like what it has become, especially the home page. Google&rsquo;s aggressive recommendations and creator&rsquo;s ability to game it have made it home to clickbaity and idiotic content.</p>
<p>Google wants to make YouTube addictive, and I <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2019/12/26/070000.html">want to fight back</a>. Here&rsquo;s the way that worked for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I either access the video directly (if I know what I want to watch) or browse my Subscriptions page (when I don’t know what to watch). The home page is useless without history turned on. And so are other recommendations. Trust me; you do not want them.</p>

<p>Well, Google has managed to ruin the subscriptions screen too.</p>
<p>As if the recommendations for sensational videos weren&rsquo;t bad, Google found another way to spike engagement or our addiction to the app - shorts. I have been vocal about <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2022/07/15/as-far-as.html">my dislike</a> for this form of content.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that Google seems to be aggressively pushing it on creators, making it more profitable in some manner. Now my subscription page is full of short videos, with no way to filter them out.</p>
<p>The high-quality videos are getting lost in this drivel of mindless shorts, even from the creators I respect. I do not know how some of the most intelligent minds are ok with this. I have seen this play out to written words &ndash; the long-form essays are lost amidst the hot takes and rants on social timelines.</p>
<p>Google has done the same to the last sane space on the platform. I can now simply get rid of my usage of this platform altogether.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Google, and thank you!</p>

			 <p>Caring for a kid and a puppy while home alone is not easy. With my wife out to the office, today was the day when I had to do exactly that for the first time. It has left me completely drained. It isn&rsquo;t easy to write freely in such a state.</p>
<p>I try to focus on my thoughts, but my mind is half-sleep, waiting for me to slide down the bed. I know it won&rsquo;t take much time for me to go into a deep slumber. Everybody around me already is. My mind asks me <em>why can&rsquo;t I</em>.</p>
<p>Today also lent me a period of loneliness in the afternoon while my daughter and Snoopy were fast asleep. I worked and read in peace, which has left me with a lot of budding ideas to chew on. I thought I would meditate on one throughout the day and put my thoughts in words, but the current state of my mind won&rsquo;t allow that. Ex-yawwwwnnn-hausted!</p>
<p>Though weary down to my core, I still love such a day. Any lone &ldquo;me time&rdquo; I can steal from my routine is worth its weight in gold. But alas, such moments have become rare.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have written spontaneously in this space for the last few days. Sure, there&rsquo;s a schedule to it, but no structure. I show up at a fixed time and type away all the thoughts at the top of my mind. Most often, it&rsquo;s a single thought that&rsquo;s clouding my mind. But there are also days when I write about a few thoughts strung together. Then, as I begin writing on a particular day, I have no clue what I will write about, just like today.</p>
<p>I looked at the blinking cursor, and no thought jumped to the fore. Everything was mundane. Not something that I felt strongly enough to put into words.</p>
<p>It made me realize how difficult it is to be spontaneous while #writing. I had once noted in my diary that <em>spontaneity in writing is priceless</em>. It is. But it is not natural to me. The train of thought that passes by as I try to stitch the words together makes the job tad more complicated. Before I am through with an idea, my mind is already wandering to the other, more alluring one. I, then, write about neither.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have turned into a planned writer. I usually have a skeleton clear in my mind about what and how I want to say. The planning at times makes me numb.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t the case when I began writing and publishing on my blog. I was an instinctive writer then &ndash; when an instinct hit me, I got rolling. I wrote till the time permitted, and the thoughts flew everywhere. I had a vague idea of what I wanted to comment on. Precisely what and how were determined as I typed along.</p>
<p>The posts I wrote then sure weren&rsquo;t the best of my works.</p>
<p>Yet I want to find that writer within me again. <em>He was fun</em>. Next, lend him my experience from writing over these years. He will bring the ideas, and I will bring in the sanity. My anticipation for this space is to be that playground.</p>
<p>I hence append the note I had made. Spontaneity in writing is priceless. <em>Just be prepared</em>.</p>

			 <p>After three weeks of <a href="https://amitg.blog/i-have-always-carried-a-clean-shaven-face-yet-i-often-want-to-sport-a-beard">bearing the beard</a>, I shaved it off today. That act felt nothing short of tearing it apart from my face. These three weeks have elevated my respect for those who regularly sport a beard. Maintaining this beast ain&rsquo;t easy. It grows willy-nilly. And twists and twirls. And bites the face. And scratches the lips. And pokes the nose.</p>
<p>I was done enduring all of that.</p>
<p>Even that wasn&rsquo;t easy to do at home, either. The beard struggled with the face. The razor struggled with the beard. And I struggled with the razor. Cleaning the mess the mayhem left behind was no less than cleaning up a crime scene. It took a toll on my morale. I needed a nice warm shower to get back to my #life.</p>
<p>I am past my fascination for a beard.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the clean-shaven me felt much less burdened, as if the beard weighed kilos. With <em>the weight of the beard off my face</em>, I walked more throughout the day. A nice morning walk. And a long evening stroll around the neighbourhood. I paused at a coffee lounge and sipped my coffee slowly. It felt good not to share it with my facial hair.</p>
<p>For a Monday, today was also unexpectedly productive. I could focus on work better. I do need to improve my way of closing tasks at hand. I like to be particular. I have my way of building a list and ticking the tasks off the list. Though it works for me, I have stopped doing it. It is time to bring out the notepad &amp; the pen and place it on the table again.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an update on the <a href="https://amitg.blog/i-had-almost-decided-that-i-would-not-publish-anything-today">meta concern</a> from yesterday. Matt <a href="https://discuss.write.as/t/billing-issue-while-upgrading-to-pro/8367/6">responded</a> to my support request and has generously extended the trial by a week while he finds a fix for my payment issue. What that means is blog is up and running as before.</p>
<p>I am happy I didn&rsquo;t have to give up on this beautiful writing interface. Sure, the issue isn&rsquo;t resolved yet. But I hope Matt finds a solution before this trial period runs out. After all, the problem isn&rsquo;t unique, and I assume it has a standard, tried-and-tested solution.</p>

			 <p>I had almost decided that I would not publish anything today. My blog got unpublished as the trial ran out, and I felt frustrated that I couldn&rsquo;t get help from anyone from the platform. I still am. Can I trust a platform if it can&rsquo;t guarantee support and get the working of basic functionality right?</p>
<p>But I am not letting this #meta concern break my streak of publishing the thoughts. Life updates have to wait as I publish another meta update.</p>
<p>I have undone most of the configurations and have set up the redirects. Setting things up with a trial account as if it were a fully working project was a mistake. But then, I didn&rsquo;t expect basic functionality like payment to fail <em>for a paid service</em>.  International payments are hard; I am surprised the platform didn&rsquo;t hit this problem earlier.</p>
<p>I wonder if I even want this update on my blog as I write this. When I started regularly publishing at this place, I thought the posts would be more personal. A slice of my life. But then, I had also said this space has no structure. No throughline. It contains what is at the top of my mind.</p>
<p>Venting my frustration about the platform is that today. So that&rsquo;s what I publish. I hope things sort out before I sit down for tomorrow&rsquo;s session. Another chance to set things right.</p>

			 <p>We had guests at our home today early in the morning. Usually, I would get a lot flustered when there&rsquo;s an unplanned visit. Not today, as these are the guests that I generally look forward to meeting in real #life. And the meeting we had. It started with lots of chitchats about nothing in particular. Chitchats are usually that, aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>We followed it up with a brunch, all delicacies of our choice and liking. Home delivered. A movie screening with popcorn at home. Winding the fun down with fresh mango ice cream. Everything was sprinkled throughout with lots of chatter and laughter.</p>
<p>I love such pleasant mornings when you meet folks you enjoy spending time with.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this messed up my routine thoroughly. I didn&rsquo;t do anything that I had planned to do. A couple of projects have been pushed to tomorrow. Some planned study time with my daughter got delayed. I hardly spent time alone with myself as there was none left. I didn&rsquo;t exercise; I screwed up my diet. I hardly read anything &ndash; the streak, alas, is broken.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a streak that isn&rsquo;t broken yet is spending the time before bed staring at the cursor blinking in this space. That I enjoy doing, and I am glad I didn&rsquo;t miss it even on a day like today of messed up routine.</p>

			 <p>I thoroughly enjoyed <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt24516518/">Vaalvi</a>, a Marathi dark comedy thriller. I don&rsquo;t remember the last time I laughed out this loud while the characters in the movie handled one serious situation after another. I wasn&rsquo;t laughing at the idiocy of the film or the characters; rather, <em>the movie wanted me to laugh</em>. Therein lies the brilliance of this film.</p>
<p>Is it perfect? Absolutely not. But it&rsquo;s an intelligent film. Sure, it has moments where it leans towards absurdity. But if you recognise the tight budget for Marathi movies and ignore such rare moments, you can enjoy even the absurdity thoroughly.</p>
<p>I wish this movie was more readily available. Do watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm0s7r3kRKw">the trailer</a> &ndash; I am sure you will enjoy it.</p>

			 <p>There is a sudden rise in minimal blogging engines that claim to have simple, no-nonsense writing interfaces. I guess many developers realise there is no point in fighting the big platforms like WordPress and Ghost on the features they are pros at. Strip out everything bloggers do not want and call that a simple system. But it is difficult to be simple and still attract users &ndash; you can&rsquo;t roll out the same features WordPress has, just in black and white.</p>
<p>As I have noted in a couple of #meta posts till now, write.as does it well. It has got a brilliant writing interface and a wonderful default reading experience. It is not minimal. It is <em>just pleasant enough</em>. And it is in this restrained form that it achieves simplicity and yet looks and behaves aesthetically to appeal to users.</p>
<p>In quest of going minimal, many systems strip out the polish off the features they provide. They look ugly. To me, it matters how the systems look. If where I write doesn&rsquo;t give me a pleasant vibe, I may not visit the place that often. I am picky about the fonts in the places I read stuff at. Flaunting system default fonts is not my definition of simplicity.</p>
<p>A simple system is not one that makes and gives no choices. Instead, it makes bold, opinionated choices.</p>

			 <p>It was a wonderful morning today &ndash; I spent time reading and #writing a lot. Nothing public. I made a journal entry in Day One after almost a month. And read a few posts from the read-later backlog. As I browse social timelines daily, I come across many excellent articles that I push to be read later. The list, though, continues to pile up. In my read-later queue are articles going back years which I know I would never reach. But they stay there, forgotten.</p>
<p>I do not like this and wish I would improve on both &ndash; make private journaling and reading from my feeds &amp; queues more regular. However, I recently found brilliant services for this.</p>
<p>Given my love for Day One, I was psyched to read the recent update of it being <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/introducing-day-one-web/">available on the web</a>. It makes the service even more accessible. I made today&rsquo;s entry from the web interface itself, and I was pleasantly surprised to see how clean the experience was. With the feature still in Beta, though, the developers have warned of the possibility of losing the data. That&rsquo;s not something I would like; hence I logged off immediately. But I do see the potential.</p>
<p>I am enjoying using <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a> (also in Beta) as my read-it-later service. It has everything I want - support for subscribing to RSS feeds and newsletters. However, the most significant benefit is its integration with Readwise (<em>duh, of course</em>). So my highlights from the articles are regularly presented along with those from the books on Kindle. I love the experience Reader provides and wish to use it more.</p>
<p>I find it funny, though, that it is not my smartphone that I enjoy doing either of these tasks. Instead, the smartphone continues to be a distraction, something to be kept feet away from myself while reading or writing. That is all.</p>

			 <p>I watched all four episodes of <a href="https://www.netflix.com/in/title/81617079">The Romantics</a> today. I loved the first two that documented the early life of Yash Chopra and the Yash Raj Films. I especially enjoyed the references to the early 90&rsquo;s movies &ndash; especially the music. That was also my biggest gripe with the docuseries &ndash; it just didn&rsquo;t speak enough about Yash Chopra&rsquo;s taste in music. And <em>his love for lyrics</em>.</p>
<p>I remember listening once to Javed Akhtar on how valuable the lyrics, the words, and the poetry was to Yash Chopra. &ldquo;If music is the body of a song, lyrics are its soul,&rdquo; Javed Akhtar had said. Yash Chopra understood that.</p>
<p>So as I got nostalgic while listening to all the songs from the yesteryears &ndash; Waqt, Kabhi Kabhi, Silsila, Chandni, Darr  &ndash; play in the background, I wished the makers of The Romantics had spent a whole episode just on his appreciation and quest for good music. There are so few Indian directors left who still value music as a core identity of movies. Yash Chopra was one of them.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Somedays are <em>frustratingly</em> productive, leaving me drained to the core. I am that today. What started as a routine day gradually turned into a busy nightmare as it went along. The only positive is that it was productive. I did everything that I had planned to complete in the morning, and then I did some more. I also checked off a couple of unplanned but priority tasks that got added to my list.</p>
<p>I am not fond of such a level of productivity. Not that I don&rsquo;t want to work. <em>I love working</em>, especially when that work involves any amount of coding. The more complicated the problem, the better I feel.</p>
<p>But I have found over 17 years of working that such productivity levels aren&rsquo;t sustainable. They leave me exhausted, needing that much more of a downtime and cool-off period. I would prefer consistently efficient days to the occasional burst of high productivity.</p>
<p>That said, there is some innate pleasure in such productive days. As I wind off the day well spent today, there is a smile of satisfaction on my face. Could I push some work to tomorrow? Sure. But it becomes difficult to pull away once I am in the flow.</p>
<p>One would think that years of experience at work make you immune to such bouts of focus. But there is no negating the drive for productivity. Especially for someone who loves what he does. <em>Someone like me</em>.</p>

			 <p>I have always carried a clean-shaven face, yet I often want to sport a beard. Sure, I frequently keep an unkempt stubble. 2-3 days of facial hair is my look when I am not meeting someone. But if we are going out, I shave. Or if we are expecting guests at home, I shave. And if I see a tired me looking back at me in the mirror, I shave. Keeping a beard hence has not been easy for me.</p>
<p>I inherited this clean look from my father, who he shaves daily without a miss. That is part of his morning routine. <em>A cup of tea can wait</em>. I have rarely seen him with stubble, let alone a full-grown beard.</p>
<p>Yet, as I write this, I carry a week&rsquo;s stubble on my face today. I am pretty certain that I want to grow a beard this time. There is a fad amongst men in India to keep a <em>well-trimmed</em> beard. And that last part makes me nervous. It is not easy to keep a beard. It takes effort to maintain it. The beard needs attention. It needs grooming. I know because I already feel itchy after a week without shaving.</p>
<p>I know there are oils and beard washes to help with the discomfort.</p>
<p>But I ask myself, why put myself through all this trouble? Why not just go with what I know and am more comfortable with? Am I ready to pay the price of experimentation on the face? Well, time to find out tomorrow.</p>

<p>YouTube sucks away time without you noticing. The best way I know to control this beast is to not be available to you. The web app is a pain enough to not be distracting. So just get rid of the app from the phone and get your time back.</p>

			 <p>We are enjoying the walks around the neighbourhood with Snoopy. With this guy getting all the attention, it makes our evenings joyous. He is the favourite among my daughter&rsquo;s friends. And they all are his best friends. He enjoys running around and walking along with them. Neither of them can get enough of the other. The goodbyes are sad; none of them wants to go back home.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t even converse with him. He can&rsquo;t tell them anything. Yet you would commonly hear the phrases &ldquo;he is tired now&rdquo;, &ldquo;he wants you to run&rdquo;, and &ldquo;he is saying <em>slow down</em>&rdquo; as they play along. It is heartening to see the friends unable to talk to one another yet understand each other so well.</p>
<p>I had another realization today. Since we <a href="https://amitg.blog/with-snoopys-last-vaccination-done-today-was-his-first-walk-around-society">started walking Snoopy</a>, I have been a lot social in general. Not swiping, committing and liking on my smartphone. But social in real #life. I have met and talked to many old friends with whom I had lost touch. And <em>I love talking to people</em>.</p>
<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t I do that when I went on my walks alone? Well, for one, I always had headphones in my ear. So the only interaction we friends had was a nod of acknowledgement. Another reason was none of us had any topic to make us pause in our steps. Now we do.</p>
<p>Will this continue? Who knows. But I want to enjoy these cheerful evenings as long as they last.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s only been two weeks since I have written a post every night, and I already feel off if I do not sit down to write as the people around me sleep. This has been a nice routine. I feel relieved that I publish something every day. I was very close today to skipping writing. A brief moment ago, I was extremely sleepy. Then I needed to record one observation.</p>
<p>Even while doing nothing, walking around the house is enough to freshen me up. Putting me back in the mood to get back to the routine. And once I am in the zone, sleep doesn&rsquo;t disturb me. It&rsquo;s only a brief moment of weariness that I need to fend off typically. That I need to overcome it to sit down at my regular place.</p>
<p>And then the words start flowing.</p>
<p>What also helps is I have marked a corner as my #writing place. Every day, <a href="https://am1t.writeas.com/late-to-bed-and-late-to-rise">at a fixed time</a>, I sit down and start typing on a blank page. Today, I tried writing at a place which wasn&rsquo;t my regular corner. I failed. I was distracted by sounds. Or <em>the lack of regular sounds</em> in my corner.</p>
<p>The moment I returned to the writing place, the process became easier.</p>
<p>Being productive writing only at a particular place/time or in a particular environment isn&rsquo;t sustainable. But it&rsquo;s a hack that works for me and might help pull me out of the writing slump.</p>

			 <p>With Snoopy&rsquo;s last vaccination done, today was his first walk around society. My wife and I had carried him around earlier though so that the surroundings weren&rsquo;t so new for him that he would go crazy whenever we take him on his first walk. That effort in the past must have helped because Snoopy behaved as if he had been on walks for ages. He didn&rsquo;t run around sniffing and biting and eating stuff. He walked and jogged and played with my daughter, never feeling overwhelmed by the large world around him.</p>
<p>I have noticed peculiar behaviour, though. People judge you when they see a pet with you. They visualize you as idle and workless, living a worthless. Their eyes speak, &ldquo;you care for a pet; you must have so much time&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I am tired of these looks. I am tired of the questions. I am tired of the suggestions. Don&rsquo;t be an asshole, man. Don&rsquo;t ask me a question to satisfy your puerile opinions. I may not answer as per your wish.</p>

			 <p>One of my routines for the past week is spending a good couple of hours on my laptop reading and writing stuff before I go to bed. This all started with my <a href="https://am1t.writeas.com/i-have-decided-to-change-my-routine-from-being-an-early-morning-person-to">change in daily routine</a>, where I begin the day late and stretch it late. Mornings never allowed me a good couple of hours for anything. At night, I feel in control.</p>
<p>Knowing that I will spend time writing during the night, a task right at the end of the day also frees me from feeling burdened in the morning. Otherwise, I felt I had to get words in before the grind began, or I would ruin my chance.</p>
<p>Sure, #writing to a writer shouldn&rsquo;t feel like a burden. But with <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2021/12/23/im-finding-it.html">my recent slump</a>, the only way I knew was to push myself to get at least 100 words in every day. On anything and everything. I have been doing that for the last few days, mainly looking inwards. In a way, these are all my journal posts.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://am1t.writeas.com/story-of-two-writing-interfaces">growing liking</a> for the write.as platform was timely too. I haven&rsquo;t announced this blog&rsquo;s feed to other known places. I don&rsquo;t share these posts at all. No crossposting either. These thoughts aren&rsquo;t open to comments in any way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would you write more (+freely) if you know no one is reading?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <a href="https://social.lol/@amit/109789419676860612">had quipped</a> recently. If these past couple of weeks are anything to go by, it&rsquo;s true for me, at least.</p>
<p>Will I never publicise this feed? Or share any of these posts? No idea. But if I do or someone stumbles across this place and follows the feed, <em>I am happy to gain a reader organically</em>. After all, who doesn&rsquo;t like his words being read?</p>

			 <p>The software that I use is generally not a conventional option. I don&rsquo;t subscribe to the established #platforms. I either find them miserably dull or overly shiny for my liking. It helps that I know deep down that I am supporting a new and upcoming player for whom my business is worth. It means something; <em>I</em> mean something as one more customer. Not &ldquo;just another customer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This also means that often the software is not fully baked. Some essential features are missing, or there are bugs around corner cases. I am an early adopter who pays more and still works as a tester. Sometimes, I get frustrated and switch to the popular option only to get out and back soon.</p>
<p>It is ok for me if you don&rsquo;t have all the features, but deliver whatever you do differently. Have an identity. Stand out.</p>

			 <p>I often forget that <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2019/08/11/001100.html">stealing hours</a> <em>from</em> sleep is not worth it &ndash; I have to pay back soon, usually on the very next day. Today was one such day.</p>
<p>I stayed up till late, doing nothing unavoidable. I read, or rather skimmed, some purposeless writing. I found nothing that interested me, but I kept on browsing with the hope that I would. And before I knew it, I was well past my routine bedtime. Thus I woke up late, which cascadingly screwed up my whole morning routine.</p>
<p>Missing my morning tea, though, was the most catastrophic effect this had today. I usually need my cup before the #life&rsquo;s chaos in gulps it down. I couldn&rsquo;t have my tea till the sun had risen more than I liked. I knew my productivity had gone for a toss.</p>
<p>The evening was better, though. I went on an unplanned walk around the neighbourhood, taking care of an unplanned but long-pending task. I hoped to mend the tea saga in the morning, so I drank jaggery tea at a nice-looking eatery. The tea saga only worsened, and let&rsquo;s leave it at that.</p>
<p>A few nice cafes have sprung up nearby that I had no clue existed. Neighbourhood passes <em>you</em> by as you pass by driving.</p>
<p>I wish I had taken a couple of pictures during the walk. Maybe next time. Without a tea saga of any sort.</p>

			 <p>Another thing that works in write.as&rsquo;s favour is that I can hardly change anything with how things look. Theming that is possible is bare. Customization in the way things work is minimum. This will ensure I don&rsquo;t get too distracted by anything that&rsquo;s not words, the #meta stuff.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a risk of me getting frustrated with the loss of control. Well, there&rsquo;s Micro.blog for that which I am not getting rid of any time soon. The platform is too valuable and near perfect not to keep as primary.</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t I gone through a similar fascination <a href="https://journal.amitgawande.com/services-that-attract-me">with Svbtle</a>? I wrote a lot there for a while but eventually got frustrated with how restricting it felt. So why&rsquo;s write.as any different? Well, for one, it allows publishing a titleless post. Second, the interface to post is minimal, with very little to configure. Svbtle felt bloated in that regard.</p>
<p>So where does this leave me? Well, I have started a 14-days trial with write.as. I want to try it to the fullest and see if and how well I use it. Is this just a fad?</p>

			 <p>A blog, for me, is a space for unformed thoughts. This is that place. And, Hey 👋 I&rsquo;m <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com">Amit Gawande</a>.</p>
<h1 id="why">why?</h1>
<p>I <a href="https://am1t.writeas.com/i-started-working-on-a-side-project-today-that-i-know-deep-down-i-do-not-have">recently realized</a> I do not enjoy updating my primary abode on the internet, <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com">my website</a> hosted elsewhere. I realized I don&rsquo;t gravitate to the posting page, so I write less. Some might say I don&rsquo;t write much because I don&rsquo;t want to. Never blame the tools and like that. But then I open the editor here at write.as, and the place feels welcoming — with its blinking cursor waiting for my unformed thoughts. I start writing, and before I know it, I have a few thoughts jotted down.</p>
<p>So, I wanted to bring some unstructuredness to my blogging. No fixed pattern, no predefined topics, and no forced post lengths. Just write.</p>
<h1 id="what">what?</h1>
<p>I write quick posts journaling whatever is at the top of my mind. The posts have no throughline, nor can you expect any structure limitation. They are a brain dump to relieve me of the thoughts crowding my mind. I am currently posting pretty regularly, with at least one post daily. But I am also not putting any pressure on myself to stick to a schedule.</p>
<p>I enjoy writing here. So I do not expect me to write short notes or quips. I may do that at microblogging-focused platforms. I also do not expect to write long-form, thoughtful essays or detailed guides.</p>
<p>The words I enjoy writing the most are in-the-moment unpretentious thoughts. Usually, in around 200-250 words. That I foresee myself publishing with this space.</p>

			 <p>I started working on a side project today that I know, deep down, I do not have time or energy for. Yet, I began because I wanted hard not to change too many things with my writing process. But I am not happy with how things are set up today. It&rsquo;s the same old battle.</p>
<p>I get bored with the setup I have. I find faults. And Micro.blog, my primary hosting platform, doesn&rsquo;t want to fix the editor. I don&rsquo;t gravitate to the posting page, so I write less. This platform needs a good editor (at least I am), and I wanted to attempt to build one. A couple of hours down the rabbit hole, I know I don&rsquo;t want to do that. There&rsquo;s a reason why I stopped hosting my blogging engines. It requires attention that my life cannot afford.</p>
<p>Some might say I don&rsquo;t write much because I don&rsquo;t want to. <em>Never blame the tools</em> and like that. But then I open the editor here at write.as, and the place feels welcoming &ndash; with its blinking cursor waiting for my thoughts, unformed as they may be. I start writing, and before I know it, I have a few thoughts jotted down. Sure, often they are #meta thoughts, as of now.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s blogging to me. No fixed pattern, no predefined topics, and no forced post lengths. So the editor need not be so bare that I lose interest. It also need not be so polished that I feel burdened. This place looks to have got the balance right.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I love the writing interface for write.as platform. No-nonsense. It does what it is supposed to do. Plus, all the other options, though available, get out of the way while I write. Grammarly works as expected. The posts are auto-saved in an intelligent way. At the same time, I can also build a list of drafts while working on them. The word count is visible, not the character count, as with Micro.blog that hosts my main website.</p>
<p>That last point tells you about the priority of these two #platforms that are very similar, yet different in many ways. Micro.blog compares itself to Twitter; hence considers itself closer to microblogging (well, <em>it&rsquo;s in the name</em>). So the writing interface looks similar to the one on Twitter. Or, for that matter, most social media platforms. A bare text box that accepts Markdown text.</p>
<p>Write.as, on the other hand, calls itself &ldquo;a place for focused writing&rdquo;. This shows with the editor. Every time I use it, I want to write long. I can&rsquo;t say the same for the text box that Micro.blog provides. It&rsquo;s suitable only for microblogging.</p>
<p>Sure. Given the platform&rsquo;s well-supported APIs, a list of clients already supports publishing to Micro.blog. So this is not an issue that many may face. However, most are only written for the Apple ecosystem, something I am not part of.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://am1t.writeas.com/i-am-recently-pretty-inspired-by-the-concept-of-wiki-or-digitalgarden">love almost everything</a> about Micro.blog. But I <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2022/08/21/i-wonder-if.html">hate its writing interface</a> and love the one provided by write.as. No surprise, then, that I am publishing most of my thoughts here.</p>
<p>This leaves me very confused. Which is my primary platform?</p>

			 <p>I love my <a href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11552529">Chromebook</a> a lot more than my Mac. The whole experience feels straightforward, no-nonsense and light. Starting/restarting is a breeze. With smart-lock, logging in and out is polished. There are no long update cycles; instead, it is always up-to-date. I have hardly seen the loading bar while using it. It is commendable, given that the underlying hardware is not as highly configured as my i9 MacBook Pro at work.</p>
<p>Sure, I do a lot more with the office Mac. But then, why would I ever need such a powerful machine for the stuff I do on my laptop? It&rsquo;s mostly the browser I use, so Chromebook is perfect.</p>
<p>Plus, this has a terminal, one thing I miss on a Windows laptop.</p>
<p>I wish I could convince more people to give <a href="https://www.google.com/chromebook/chrome-os/">ChromeOS</a> a try. Especially, my parents could benefit a lot from this simple device. But, they are worried whenever I tell them to stop using their Windows laptop. They hated Linux (of course, <em>what was I even thinking</em>). They can&rsquo;t make any sense of macOS. iPad is too bare for them, and the onscreen keyboard is a pain. Chromebook is the best fit for them. If only they would listen to me.</p>

			 <p>I started reading (listening to) a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23153154-memory-man">novel by David Baldacci</a> today and decided right away I didn&rsquo;t need to continue doing that. It started with gruesome details of a crime scene. Not the way I want to start my day. Or end my day. For that matter, I am tired of crime and mystery novels for now. This is the genre that I have been reading for the past few months. I will take a pause now.</p>
<p>I usually listen to my #books while on a morning walk. Crime novels are not the best companion at that time of the hour.</p>
<p>I returned the audiobook and purchased P. G. Wodehouse &ndash; the Blandings Castle collection. I will let Stephen Fry narrate light stories from the master of humour throughout the day. And I have got about 45 hours of that narration. Nice!</p>

			 <p>I have decided to change my routine from being an early-morning person to becoming a late-night guy. I realized that the mornings did not leave me with much time. The routine got packed recently with the added responsibility of Snoopy gobbling up the mornings. It just didn&rsquo;t leave me much time to read and write.</p>
<p>So when Snoopy recently started going to bed early, leaving me a silent hour at night, I couldn&rsquo;t pass on the opportunity. I sit alone with my laptop and a blinking cursor at write.as. There is hardly any noise around as my wife and daughter are in bed with their thoughts. Doing their stuff.</p>
<p>Mornings in my #life had stopped being calm. I was always praying that others should <em>not</em> wake up early. Before that, <em>I should</em>. Even if I did wake up, I felt sleepy. Thoughts ceased to come through. There was always something waiting to clog my mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I should read the news first?&rdquo; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t make too much noise, or I will wake others&rdquo;. &ldquo;Let me just lie down for 15 minutes&rdquo;. And on and on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how I remember a productive morning routine. It was time to change things. I have. I have no idea if this works. I hope, for the sake of my writing, that it does.</p>

			 <p>Matt Gemmell reminded me recently that it is ok to <a href="https://mattgemmell.scot/write-less/">write less</a>. However, this passage especially caught my attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blogs were originally a kind of diary, and they were mostly repositories of short pieces, not huge articles. It&rsquo;s an absolute fallacy that longer works are better or more valuable; indeed, shorter pieces are more likely to be read and digested, which intrinsically increases their value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I had <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2022/08/03/not-a-natural.html">complained recently</a>, I have been growing through a slump in my writing. I have started taking my blogging too seriously. &ldquo;Not every thought deserves to be published&rdquo;, I convinced myself. Or &ldquo;this needs to be elaborated; the readers won&rsquo;t understand&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This might sound rude, but since when have I started caring about my readers? I should read some of my earlier posts. They were terrible. They made no sense then and don&rsquo;t make any sense even now. <em>Even to me.</em> So why care?</p>
<p>Publish anything, everything. Short, long - doesn&rsquo;t matter. Anywhere that&rsquo;s convenient at the moment. Don&rsquo;t take Grammarly too seriously. Get back to writing more. I can work on making it better later.</p>

			 <p>I am recently pretty inspired by the concept of wiki or #digitalgarden. I <a href="https://wiki.amitg.net/">have got me one</a>. Why? Well, it goes back to my belief that blogs are boring. The list of posts displayed reverse chronologically doesn&rsquo;t help much. I&rsquo;ve read many articles on how blogs and their typical homepage have made the web dull.</p>
<p>But it also is one more place to update. So many places that I can write, and yet I hardly write anything these days. Or is it <em>because</em> I have so many places to write at. Whatever the reason, the ups and downs of the inspiration for the writer in me continue.</p>
<p>There are so many things I do not like about Micro.blog. Yet that #platform remains the platform of choice for me. Why? Because it does everything just enough. I wish it got the writing interface right.</p>

			 <p>While responding to an observation from Ben Werdmuller, Om Malik <a href="https://om.co/2023/01/25/is-stream-as-a-design-paradigm-over/">asks</a>, &ldquo;Is reverse chronological &lsquo;stream&rsquo; still a valid design principle?&rdquo; I believe the answer is complicated.</p>
<p>As with most folks commenting on Om&rsquo;s blog, I have been a follower of his writings for a long time. And also been a blogger since updating one&rsquo;s blog, and visiting others to look for inspiration was a multiple-times-a-day activity. It still matters for all of us who have consumed the stream of blog posts. Or at least we understand it.</p>
<p>I generally follow blogs through RSS, where a stream is meaningless. But I would still follow a linked post to a new blogger that I don&rsquo;t know about. I then browse through the stream of posts to see if the blogger&rsquo;s topic and writing interest me. If it does, I subscribe to his RSS. So the stream is important for me for discoverability.</p>
<p>But the people who haven&rsquo;t ever consumed such a stream of blog posts may not find it helpful. The algorithm has spoilt us with the &ldquo;recommendations&rdquo; &ndash; the links to the other stuff on the platform.</p>
<p>So we as bloggers should serve the same. Recommend stuff to the reader on <em>our platform, our blogs</em>. On our home pages. And around our posts. But instead of letting AI decide, let&rsquo;s curate these recommendations manually. We have all the tools that we need. Tags/Categories. Let&rsquo;s add a few layers if required.</p>
<p>I have already started doing this with my blog. I have modified my home page to take readers to specific sections of the blog. I have separated posts prominently. I want to introduce a few more sections on blog and around posts. This is all still a work in progress, though.</p>
<p>Another tangential thought. We have stripped our blogs of all the fun in our quest to get minimal. Do you remember the tag/word clouds? Posts by date? By category? Or most commented? Let&rsquo;s bring them all back. We had more than one way of presenting our blogs to the readers. Why did we stop that?</p>

<p>I finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780307463746">Rework</a> by Jason Fried today 📚</p>
<p>I loved the simple, usually apparent suggestions. Most go against the proven and often advised business best practices. I love the bold ideas and the no-nonsense way the suggestions are delivered through simple short chapters. But, I am afraid I will not be able to benefit from most of them. Jason targets folks like him who are in positions of decision-making regarding how their businesses are run. Not many are in that position. So, as much as I would love my organization to follow even a few of Jason&rsquo;s suggestions, I am afraid I cannot influence that.</p>
<p>That said, though, I will keep the book close so that I refer back to the clarity of thinking that Jason has lived his business career with. I hope it comes in handy someday.</p>

			 <p>My family and I watched <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/strange_world_2022">Strange World</a> yesterday. I don&rsquo;t remember when I was this unimpressed with a Disney movie. The makers attempted to hit a lot of big ideas but forgot what story they wanted to tell. The world-building is half-baked and foolish. The emotional parts bore you. The climax is dull.</p>
<p>My wife quipped, &ldquo;Disney doesn&rsquo;t know how to make a movie with a male protagonist.&rdquo; After all, when did Disney last make a movie with a strong father-son dynamic? Maybe Nemo?</p>
<p>This comment from <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/strange-world-review-disneys-audacious-new-animated-film.html">Alison Willmore&rsquo;s review</a> of the movie resonated with me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So much of Strange World’s audaciousness is front-loaded into its concept, and so little of it comes through in the execution. Its themes linger in the mind longer than any line or emotional beat in part because those elements feel so rote and secondary.</p>

<p>I finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781781251485">The Obstacle is the Way: The Ancient Art of Turning Adversity to Advantage</a> by Holiday Ryan today 📚</p>
<p>Laced with real-life examples and a corresponding lesson in each chapter, Ryan Holiday presents valuable insight into handling obstacles. Nicely structured in three sensible parts &ndash; perception, action and will &ndash; this is a good, practical guide to staying balanced without getting bogged down by roadblocks and failures in life. Ryan doesn&rsquo;t want to make this a guide for stoic philosophy. Instead, he sprinkles the best of the lessons throughout the book. That helps keep things simple, which most books on Stoicism fail to do.</p>
<p>As he mentions towards the end, many people he tells the tale of &ldquo;embodied the best practices of Stoicism without even knowing it&rdquo;. Ryan recommends that just doing matters more. For his intention to not complicate the philosophy, he deserves credit.</p>

			 <p>One of the problems with Twitter is that it became a lot bigger and important than just a fun social network. Like someone built a fun clicker to play with and others made it a switch that can trigger wars.</p>

			 <p>My aversion for the concept of timezone is not hidden - I probably have an yearly post begrudgingly accepting the fallout of this weird phenomenon.</p>
<p>What makes it worse though is how each region is allowed to select their own timezones. This makes the situation messier than anything to do with time should be. Just search YouTube for weird timezones. There are ample examples of how we have screwed this up.</p>
<p>I read about another such <a href="https://www.howderfamily.com/blog/australias-weird-little-time-zone/">weird little timezone from Australia</a> - given the size and nature of the region involved, this has to be amongst the craziest.</p>

<p>I hope to live my life in the same manner, in portrait mode. Put things that matter to me in focus. Blur the sidelines into the background. It might be messy around me. It always is. But to let it impact my perspective towards the moment or not is my choice.</p>
<p>So a friendly reminder for myself - put what matters in focus. Make the ugliness that surrounds me the blurred background. It may only heighten the charm of the moment.</p>
<p>And as with photography, not all perspectives can be portraits. But <em>some certainly should</em>.</p>

			 <p>Every service wants to be everyone&rsquo;s favourite. But what the makers are working towards is being favoured. Or popular. There is a minute but significant distinction between those two.</p>
<p>It is easy to market something subjective, which is what the latter is. &ldquo;Best&hellip;&rdquo;. &ldquo;Most liked&hellip;&rdquo;. &ldquo;Hottest&hellip;&rdquo;. How often do we hear those words in advertisements? The former, on the other hand, is binary. Objective. You are either someone&rsquo;s favourite, or you are not. More often than not, people won&rsquo;t know what their favourite something is. Ask someone for their favourite movie or a book, and she can&rsquo;t put her finger on one.</p>
<p>Being a favourite is also singular. What point is being just one person&rsquo;s favourite? You can&rsquo;t market that. Of course, as long as the someone in question is not famous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder if seeking to be someone&rsquo;s favourite is more satisfying than trying to be popular to everyone.</p>

			 <p>I have never had the dark mode turned off since the option was made available on my devices. I did today. After an initial bout of pain, things don&rsquo;t look too bad. Instead, they look cleaner. The whole experience - the platform, the apps, the websites - is so very different.</p>
<p>One thing is pretty apparent - all the interfaces look better in the light mode. As if the apps are designed for the light mode first. The setting, the interface elements, and the colour palette look ingrained. With the dark mode, all apps look the same &ndash; white text on limited shades of dark background. Maybe that is the reason many people prefer this mode. Irrespective of the app, it looks the same.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind a diverse collection of interfaces. So against the wishes of the techie in me, I will extend this experiment for a bit longer on my smartphone. I will use it with the dark mode turned off. It can&rsquo;t be too bad, right?</p>

			 <p>Choices are abundant these days - more variety of cuisines, more brands of clothes, more range of devices, more solutions. More of the same, yet <em>different in imperceivable ways</em>. More is good, right?</p>
<p>Not when the dread of choosing paralyses me. Making a selection demands brain cycles, both while and after choosing. It needs time from you. If there is real money involved, the process is even more demanding. Fear of regret kicks in then.</p>
<p>Is the other one better? Cheaper? Would I hate this later? Will my family hate me for choosing this? Will this improve my life? Each question is more complex than the previous one.</p>
<p>In the false hope of &ldquo;saving&rdquo; time and money, I postpone choosing. My unmade decisions pile up, and so does the burden on me. It is a vicious cycle – I delay choosing because I feel vague pressure, a choice that only adds to my burden.</p>
<p>Not choosing is a choice too. Make it your default, and it will only make you weaker.</p>

			 <p>Ever since I published the Paper theme to Micro.blog, I wanted to port one with multiple columns and yet stay minimal as possible. I&rsquo;ve found one, and today I managed to port it to and customize it for Micro.blog. The theme, called <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/79">Anatole</a>, is a beautiful minimalist two-column theme. You can check for yourself in the screenshot below or see it live on <a href="https://amit-test.micro.blog/">my test blog</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The theme is <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/79">available in Micro.blog&rsquo;s Plug-ins directory</a> and can directly be installed from there. Note that <strong>the theme is compatible with Hugo 0.91</strong>, which is available as a setting on Micro.blog. You can follow the below general steps to install the theme.</p>
<ul>
<li>Uninstall any theme that you have installed as a plugin.</li>
<li>Set your current theme to blank and Hugo Version to 0.91 in the design section of your blog.</li>
<li>Make sure there are no other conflicting custom CSS configured for the previous theme.</li>
<li>Install the &ldquo;<a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/79">Anatole theme</a>&rdquo; plug-in from the directory.</li>
<li>Once the theme is successfully installed, you can configure the social icons displayed in the header by modifying the available options as plug-in settings.</li>
<li>Additionally, you can configure parameters to display full post content on the homepage, disable animations and provide a path to a custom favicon.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was fun to bring another option to Micro.blog&rsquo;s already brilliant collection themes. I hope you like this and that a few folks benefit from it. If you do, I would love to hear from you. All feedback is welcome.</p>

<p>And I am only talking about the capabilities of the devices on me. I am surrounded by technology that brings a smile to my face every day throughout the day.</p>
<p>I can be frustrated by the things these gadgets cannot do well (or can&rsquo;t do at all). Or I can be angry with them when they alter my habits against my will.</p>
<p>But just as the technology is at fault for not acting responsibly, so am I for not using it sensibly. When <em>I wish</em> the technology to alter itself to not burden me, <em>I share</em> the responsibility to find ways to not be controlled by it.</p>
<p>Do I have enough levers? That&rsquo;s debatable. What isn&rsquo;t, though, is my love for technology.</p>

			 <p>If you write a blog and are interested in conversing with your readers, do include a link for the reader to do so right below your every post. I would love it if every blog post had a way for me to respond. A comment form. An email address for me to mail the writer at. Or even a link to the social media where the post is syndicated. Basically, redirect me, the reader, to any place where the conservation is taking place. I can, of course, theorise why most people have stopped doing that.</p>
<p>First, the spam industry has dampened one of the promises of the internet — having open connections with people on the web. We are afraid now that we will be bombarded by comments and messages that we have no interest in sifting through. Second, most blogging platforms have stopped providing an easy way to enable conversations, which came built-in with WordPress and others. It’s an added decision (and even a cost in some cases) for the writer to provide such an option to its reader. A trouble that many folks just don’t want to sign up for.</p>
<p>I wish that wasn’t the case. My conversations with people around the words I write have been an essential aspect of my blogging for the past many years. If you haven’t tried that, or you did but aren’t doing it actively anymore, give it a chance again.</p>
<p>You take the trouble so that your user doesn’t have to.</p>

			 <p>Our species' collective common sense is on a downward trend; my movie theatre experience yesterday proved this again. With mobile phones in their hands, they kill the vibe with the ringtones and flashes. A few pick up the calls in the middle of the movie. Some peek at their phones out of habit just to check the notifications. So what&rsquo;s fricking wrong with these folks? Can you not stay away from the dopamine-inducing notifications even for a couple of hours?</p>
<p>There is also a crazy trend on the rise recently. People are creating reels of theatre response — a highly anticipated scene begins, the entry of an important character or a dialogue or a fight sequence, and people have their smartphones out recording the screen. What the fuck, man!</p>
<p>I am ready to pay extra for watching a movie at a theatre with a &ldquo;no smartphone allowed&rdquo; policy. I know it&rsquo;s near impossible, but a guy can dream, can&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p>A sidetone, the movie I watched was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikram_Vedha_(2022_film)">Vikram Vedha</a>, and I absolutely loved it. I don&rsquo;t care that it&rsquo;s a remake. It is <em>remade</em> well, in the right spirit, and backed by solid performances.</p>

<p>I finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781526647115">Stolen Focus</a> by Johann Hari today 📚</p>
<p>I loved the premise of this book but found the second half unconvincing. Sure, lack of sleep or hunger or extended work hours does lead to loss of focus. But they do harm our society in a lot of other ways. We can&rsquo;t point to every problem that plagues the world today and say it affects our focus. Similarly, ridding ourselves of the focus problem can help us solve even more significant issues. But without concrete actions, it is all talk.</p>
<p>The extent of topics that Hari wants to cover with the book is too spread for my liking. I wished it was more focused on the subject.</p>

			 <p>Even though I knew deep within that it was coming, the news of <a href="https://www.espn.in/tennis/story/_/id/34596649/roger-federer-announces-retirement-play-laver-cup-final-event">Federer&rsquo;s retirement</a> saddens me. Being an Indian, I never thought I would watch any sport as intently as I watched Cricket. Or cheer for anyone as loud as I did for India. Federer made me do both &ndash; this man is why I fell in love with Tennis.</p>
<p>I cheered every time he effortlessly hit those winners <em>precisely where he wanted</em>. There was some elegance to his aggression that always attracted me, something that the ferocity in the play of his competitors lacked. As his rivalry with Nadal grew, so did the craze amongst us tennis-crazy friends. The respect for both lived through many heartbreaks, one particular during undoubtedly <a href="https://youtu.be/f8YEiCAPAbg">the greatest match</a> of all time.</p>
<p>As the sport moved on, leaving the beauty of the master&rsquo;s gameplay behind, I moved away from the sport. I have never enjoyed the game since. Yet whenever Federer participated in a tournament, I refreshed the scores during his matches. I hoped that he managed to swat a winner against his tiring, ageing body. Just as he did through his graceful backhands over the years. Alas, it wasn&rsquo;t to be.</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing cheer to millions of faces. We <em>and the sport</em> will miss your game, GOAT.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t get Apple&rsquo;s iPhone 14 lineup. Let me be upfront and say I have no intention of being an asshole. Or to troll Apple. I am genuinely curious if Apple has improved iPhone 14 (non-Pro) in any significant way over the last year&rsquo;s model. Even S models from yesteryears had more significant upgrades. If I am wrong, I must have missed reading something between the line.</p>
<p>If there ever was a generation of iPhones that the previous year&rsquo;s model could be recommended over, this lineup has to be the prime candidate.</p>

			 <p>I didn&rsquo;t follow the Apple event live &ndash; I was sleeping peacefully, unaware of what Apple was announcing. I&rsquo;d also skipped the WWDC and Google I/O keynotes. Knowing that the improvements will only be incremental, my excitement for these tech events has dwindled in recent years.</p>

<p>I finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780753553909">Think Again</a> by Adam Grant today 📚</p>
<p>Though the book is in no way short, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Grant presents numerous ideas across sections and chapters &ndash; some focused on individuals, others on teams. Some on one&rsquo;s personal life, others on the professional one. Given the recent trend of expanding trivial ideas into a book, I admire the depth Grant attempts with this book.</p>
<p>Sure, not everything works for me. Not all suggestions are practical. A few chapters and their conclusions contradict the more significant point being made. Some sections just have no relation to the central premise of thinking again. The conclusion sounds weakest as if it was added after the thought (something that Grant acknowledges in the Epilogue).</p>
<p>As I struggle today with forming opinions amidst the information overload, this was an essential read. Every help I get to <em>think better</em> is welcome.</p>

			 <p>I have been using a MacBook with Touch Bar for the past couple of weeks. I used this panel regularly for the first time. I can see why Apple wanted this to stick &ndash; when it works, it works well. For example, Zoom puts the buttons for full screen, mute, and video on/off front and centre. It, no doubt, speeds up the flow. But searching for the escape button is an absolute pain!</p>
<p>Apple screwed up the execution. Instead of <em>replacing</em> the row of function keys, this should have been an additional panel above the keyboard. It was ok even if this was available on the larger MacBooks only. But, alas. Apple knows better.</p>

			 <p>I wonder if no one on Micro.blog creates any type of long-form posts using the web editor. I can&rsquo;t be the only one who finds this interface too limiting. It is suitable only for short updates. The goal of keeping things simple shouldn&rsquo;t hamper the experience of writing posts. Whenever I attempt to write a long post with this interface, I instantly look for other options. Sure, I don&rsquo;t switch. But I would <em>love</em> to avoid having this feeling.</p>
<p>Saving and building on a draft is unnecessarily complicated. Keyboard shortcuts do not work consistently &ndash; undo/redo often messes up the post. This is exasperated by the already small editor window. In addition, the experience is not consistent between writing a new post and editing a draft.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time I have complained about the writing interface. I <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2021/08/06/231037.html">wrote this</a> almost a year ago (and that wasn&rsquo;t the first either).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The editing experience remains poor for long-form posts – both from a desktop and a mobile device. It&rsquo;s a great system with a promising base, but still has a long way to go before I can use it for the longer form content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/the-web-new-post-page-needs-basic-features-please/1090">am I the only one</a> with the request. The editor is the most essential part of any blogging system. I hope Manton gets time to work on fixing it, an ask that&rsquo;s pending for too long now. Without this, the platform isn&rsquo;t fit for the blogging needs of full-length posts.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed this one. Paul Gumbs, the central character, comes out as a natural hero. The mystery is breezy and never slows down unnecessarily. I am involved in Butterfly Island and the characters living there enough that I&rsquo;ll no doubt pick up the next one in the series.</p>

			 <p>I am not a horror movie fan. I have seen a few over the years but do not enjoy them. With age, my patience with them has further gone down. I do not watch this genre at all anymore. Or so I thought.</p>
<p>I was recently reminded of my dislike as I read <a href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-horror-movies-of-all-time/">this list</a> from the editors at Rotten Tomatoes. I realized that there <em>are</em> few movies in this genre that I have enjoyed. Or I do still enjoy. The likes of The Mist or Jaws Or The Shining. Or the number one on the list, Psycho. Or the one I thoroughly enjoyed recently - Get Out.</p>
<p>Basically, I don&rsquo;t mind psychological thrillers. Or ones with creatures. But I am done watching haunted houses and ghosts and unnecessary gore.</p>
<p>That said, I do enjoy reading the plots of the movies, predominantly from the horror genre, that I have no interest in. I have read so many movie plots on Wikipedia. I was anyway not going to watch the movie. By reading the plot, I at least know that the one twist the movie was sold on is shit.</p>

			 <p>I watched <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_batman">The Batman</a> today &ndash; I am glad that after a few terrible few showings, we have a good setting again. It&rsquo;s not a perfect movie &ndash; it&rsquo;s too long and too thin. But I loved the way it&rsquo;s shot, it does &ldquo;look and sound brilliant&rdquo;. The first half is particularly gripping. I didn&rsquo;t like the Riddler though, his eccentricities felt forced.</p>
<p>That said though, the first thing this movie made me do was rewatch a few sequences from The Dark Knight series. The heights that Nolan took this superhero to is hard to scale.</p>

<p>I finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780857197696">The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness</a> by Morgan Housel 📚</p>
<p>A short, but brilliant read. Housel writes in an easy-to-follow manner even though the topic he talks about is not. Some might say this belongs to a series of blog posts. But the chapters and respective takeaways sound coherent.</p>
<p>As Housel mentions, there cannot be a single investing strategy for every person out there. Each individual&rsquo;s background is different. Their goals are different. And so are their perspectives. In the same spirit, two individuals cannot have the same set of takeaways from this book.</p>
<p>So do give this a read and discover for your own.</p>

			 <p>I have been a PC guy since I was 10 years old. The first version that I used was Windows 95. I stayed the longest with Windows 98. I fell in love with Windows XP even on my PC hardware that didn&rsquo;t support the OS well then.</p>
<p>However, what I had for this platform wasn&rsquo;t love. For the small town I am from, Windows was the default platform. At home, in school and at work. Mac OS wasn&rsquo;t a name anyone had heard. Linux was limited to textbooks.</p>
<p>I dabbled with the latter during my bachelor&rsquo;s and the developer in me was instantly captivated. It wasn&rsquo;t ready to replace the default OS on my desktop though. There was still some time to go before it could go mainstream. So like most folks around me, I dual-booted Windows and Linux.</p>
<p>However, I believe things have improved since then. There are many &ldquo;flavours&rdquo; of Linux today that target users beyond developers. Why not then should I give them a try again?</p>
<p>So I <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2022/05/30/i-have-replaced.html">have been running Linux</a> as my primary OS for more than a few months now. I haven&rsquo;t missed my default platform yet. It may not still be ready for all the people that Microsoft targets with Windows. But it is ready to be the default platform for many tech-minded folks out there.</p>
<p>I am not going back to Windows anymore. I don&rsquo;t have any incentive,</p>
<p>PS: I am trying <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/google-chrome-os-flex-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-use-it/ar-AAZrwUy">Chrome OS Flex</a> currently. I am pretty impressed with this flavour of an operating system. It&rsquo;s light and fast. Plus it also runs Linux now. Except for the fear of Google, this platform has a lot going for it.</p>

			 <p>I suck at emojis &ndash; I don&rsquo;t understand this language. Why are there so many representations of the quality of laughter? Grinning, Smiling, Beaming and whatnot. I understand each word means something different, but conveying that through the right emoji is a task in itself. I mean seriously, what&rsquo;s the difference between emoji representing &ldquo;Grinning Face with Smiling Eyes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beaming Face with Smiling Eyes&rdquo;? I will never know that.</p>
<p>We have around 3600 emojis (<a href="https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-counts.html">3633 to be exact</a>), which include gender or skin tones. Isn&rsquo;t that number too large? Plus it keeps growing every year. Sure, add new emojis that people want and anticipate. But remove a few tens that get hardly used. Who uses Dotted Line Face 🫥? What does it even mean?</p>
<p>Emoji is a powerful language &ndash; fastest growing at that. But it need not grow meaninglessly.</p>
<p>Side note, did you know 😭 is <a href="https://emojipedia.org/stats/">the most used emoji</a>? It represents the pain that is using the right emoji.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t watch Reels because, well, I don&rsquo;t use Instagram. Or Tiktok. Or <em>whatever app that&rsquo;s trending now</em>. But I keep going back to YouTube often when I have short time to pass. I hate that the app is aggressively pushing the Shorts nowadays.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that the videos are trash. They are neither fun nor informative. They register only as much as a dented luxury car would &ndash; I go &ldquo;huh, that&rsquo;s odd&rdquo; and move on.</p>

			 <p><em>I</em> don’t write a newsletter well. <em>I</em> don’t understand this medium. I have tried it a few times now. The first time, I published it as a links log, sharing links that I found useful. Then I made it personal, a letter about what’s up with me. It could well have been a blog post, every time. A weekly digest of my posts was a good tradeoff between a mindless link log and why-can’t-this-be-blog-post thought. But it felt meaningless.</p>
<p>To be frank, I don’t want to sign up for the added dance around subscribers and their numbers. I like it when I don’t know anything about who reads what I write. Also, I enjoy it when I am not forced to stick to a schedule of any sort. There are periods when I am highly active, writing, and sharing regularly. But then there are times when I don’t.</p>
<p>Newsletter wants to force a schedule onto me. Without a schedule, a newsletter is just another outlet for my blog posts.</p>
<p>I am an instinctive writer, my writing does not have any structure. Or nature. I write about anything and everything that interests me now. Because I <em>read</em> anything and everything that interests me now. My blog serves me best for the form of writing I do. Newsletters work for many — I enjoy reading them. But the form is not a natural fit for me.</p>
<p>So, I  am done with my newsletters experiment. Every issue I have published <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/categories/essays/">is available on my blog</a> as an essay. I intend on keeping it this way. <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> continues to exist.</p>

<p>The sense that one has become the instrument of invention is so satisfying that I find it truly stupefying that anyone would claim that artists are motivated to create primarily by the money they might get from such miracles. Not to say they shouldn&rsquo;t be paid. Paying them provides them with more time and liberty to channel art. But it&rsquo;s a rare artist who&rsquo;s in it for the money. A real artist creates because he has no choice. He is pressed into the involuntary service of art, and thereby, humanity.</p>

<p>An insightful read this, <a href="https://mattgemmell.com/verisimilitude/">Verisimilitude by Matt Gemmell</a>. I found this suggestion really on the mark.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research is a distillation. You’ll spend two hours reading, to get four paragraphs of notes, which provide eight words of story — but those eight words will take the reader into the world you’ve created, and create the impression that your character really is there, or really knows about this topic. Just make sure it’s either unremarkable that they would know those things, or that their knowledge has been explicitly accounted for.</p>

			 <p>A smartphone with a case is just not the same device. I have never used a device without a case ever. A slippery slab of fragile glass just doesn’t feel comfortable sitting in my hand. So, I just wrap it in a case and carry it along. It gives the device a physical and me a psychological cushion against any accidental falls. But every time I take the device out of the case for cleaning, putting it back in the case feels like a crime. It loses all its charm. Every device looks the same with a case on — the camera bump, the notch, the punch-hole fail to help.</p>
<p>As I hold this device in my hand again, about to commit a crime against it, I am seriously considering not going through with it. Will the worst happen? By writing about it, have I already jinxed it?</p>

<p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781101904220">Dark Matter: A Novel</a> by Blake Crouch 📚</p>
<p>It had a brilliant premise — unique and fascinating. However, I didn&rsquo;t enjoy the many turns it took in the second half. There were a lot of moments when the book felt stretched, unnecessarily rambling along when the point was already made. I didn&rsquo;t like the simplistic conclusion either after Crouch had so well established the intricacies of the plot.</p>
<p>I wanted to love this book for its story, wish Crouch didn&rsquo;t get distracted with and overwrote the specific moments in the story.</p>

			 <p>Writing publicly, with the voice of your readers chirping at the back of your mind, is ineffective. You write for interaction – that’s futile. Most social media posts belong to this category. You are reined back by the voice — you write <em>for</em> someone else. The response you expect from them, your readers, provides you the lead. You write not what you like, you write what you think your reader likes.</p>
<p>Sure, this approach can churn some of the most well-received works of creation. It’s the satisfaction within the writer, the creator, that gets crushed in the process.</p>

It&rsquo;s not limited in number of attempts. The help page says, &ldquo;You will need more than six guesses. You will probably need dozens of guesses&rdquo;. Sounds about right. Plus it has hints. Yet it feels difficult and exciting. Do give it a try when you have some time.</p>

			 <p>I have released an upgrade (v1.1) to Paper theme for Micro.blog today that allows modifying the default behaviour of the homepage. It includes a setting now to display full post content on the homepage of the blog. Here’s how the homepage with this setting on will look like. You can also check the same on <a href="https://amit-test.micro.blog">my test blog</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is one of the most asked for features since the first release. I could never get the look right without ruining the spirit of the theme. Or so I like to believe because the change isn’t too significant in itself. So, irrespective of which option you decide to go with, the homepage should feel as part of the original simple and clean theme.</p>
<p>If you are using the Paper theme, look out for the upgrade option in Plugins. It should be enabled soon. As always, if you find any bug or want any improvements, kindly let me know either as <a href="https://github.com/am1t/microdotblog-paper/issues/new">GitHub issue</a> or connect with me on <a href="https://micro.blog/amit">Micro.blog</a> / via <a href="mailto:reply@amitgawande.com">email</a>.</p>

			 <p>I read a lot many long-form posts that are published with Substack these days. I know that’s anecdotal, but I wonder if Substack is becoming a blogging platform of choice for folks now. Or newsletters are newsletters no more? Well, what is a newsletter?</p>
<p>I like when a newsletter is more than just a list of links. Or a bowl of jumbled, unrelated recommendations. Not that I don’t enjoy them — I appreciate the effort that goes in curating these best-of reads. I have found them useful many a time. But deep down, I <em>love</em> reading letters. It reminds me of the days when I used to post handwritten physical mails to my family and close friends. Those words had an innate charm and closeness. I enjoy a newsletter that’s a letter first.</p>
<p>That tangential thought aside, I believe Substack is a publishing platform for newsletters first. But given the way it is set up, it is also a publishing platform for the long-form posts. If you don’t subscribe to a publication, most probably you are going to read it as a blog post. That’s what seems to be happening to me.</p>

			 <p>With many avenues of tracking and improving my well-being already around me, I have decided to make the best use of them. I know I am not good at maintaining a healthy routine for any meaningful duration. Yet, I want to give myself another chance to succeed at forming one by constant nudges and tickles.</p>
<p>A reference to <a href="https://www.wholelifechallenge.com">Whole Life Challenge</a> (h/t <a href="https://www.cygnoir.net/2022/04/16/i-made-it.html">Halsted Bernard</a>) with its pointed question “What is healthy to you?” front and centre came in handy. The tagline, “don’t try to fit health and wellness into your life. Fit your life into the context of health and wellness” resonated with me. I always had the tools that allow me to track my progress towards a healthy lifestyle; with the recommendations from this challenge, I know what I need to track. I am not undertaking any challenge, but I am going to follow along.</p>
<p>So, I am tracking the seven habits – nutrition, hydrate, exercise, mobilise, sleep, well-being and reflect. With health apps from Samsung and Google, I make note of everything I eat, being cognisant of my diet. I don’t want to cut down on anything yet, but just understand what goes in. Keeping myself hydrated is not a problem I face, I drink enough water regularly.</p>
<p>Though I already do the running and stretching pretty regularly, I am now consciously walking while carrying out the daily chores instead of riding my motor scooter. Though I can’t sleep with a watch on, I now manually enter my hours of sleep. Sure, I miss out on the detailed reports of my sleep pattern, but this is better than nothing. With the bedtime mode scheduled on my smartphone, the screen goes greyscale, reminding me to rid myself of the clingy device. It helps!</p>
<p>Building a habit for well-being has been difficult for me. Meditation, the only well-being activity that I know of, never stuck. I can meditate, but I don’t do this with the right spirit. A constant thought of “am I doing this right” keeps pestering me throughout, and I know I’m <em>not</em> doing it right. Well, who knew there are other well-being practises too – picking up a book, reaching out to a friend or organising a disheveled space. Ah, now <em>that</em> I can do. And do well.</p>
<p>All said, these are early days. I am just a week into tracking these habits and I have already missed out on a couple each day. (I am using a wonderfully simple app, Loop Habit Tracker, to track these). But I am allowing myself the leniency.</p>

			 <p>Mumbai Indians (MI) lost another match yesterday — this year’s IPL has been boring. The two statements are independent, mutually exclusive. Or so I like to believe. Since the core of the team was broken, players distributed across the teams, I just can’t connect with the team anymore.</p>
<p>We just had the last IPL some 5 months back, didn’t we? And here we go again already. The lust to milk the most out of the hottest property on Indian television had to come back to bite them in the bums. They are killing the sport for generations, old and young. 🏏</p>

			 <p>I have been pretty happy with <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2022/03/27/i-upgraded-to.html">Galaxy S22</a> that I recently purchased, and yet, I find it surprising that my friend’s circle chose it over iPhones everytime to click pictures. This choice is driven by Samsung’s preference to make the pictures look better, clearer over Apple’s to make them look close to real. People who understand photography will always prefer the latter, the most of the mainstream will prefer the former. No surprise, some unknown Android devices keep winning the blind smartphone camera challenges that tech reviewers carry out, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp4nWm59esI">one Marques Brownlee does</a>.</p>
<p>A tangential thought, what do you call the folks that are not experts? The non-reviewers. The enthusiasts. Or the nerds? These are the folks that form the majority market, ones that most companies target. I always struggle to find a term that isn’t derogatory to either side. I at times call them common folks, but it doesn’t sound right to me. Neither does “normal” — that makes the tech enthusiasts, the group I belong to, non-normal? Again, doesn’t sound right. I recently heard someone call this section “muggles”. Yuck! Have people even read the books?</p>
<p>Anyway, back to my device selection. I have been part of the Apple ecosystem for a long time. When I recently switched to Android with a OnePlus device, I was worried that I may miss the benefits of the ecosystem. Well, I did. But not enough to make me go back to the Apple devices. With a Galaxy smartphone now, I had a chance to get back to an ecosystem of sorts again. Samsung has over the years build a viable alternative for each Apple device. A shameless copy initially, now all of them have an identity of their own. One such device is Galaxy Watch 4 which is different from Apple Watch, yet equally powerful when paired with a Galaxy smartphone. For the past week, I have been enjoying how both these devices work together. Samsung’s strategy looks to be working.</p>

<p>I can’t remember the last time I enjoyed listening to a book as much as I did <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary">Project Hail Mary</a> by Andy Weir. Of course, Weir deserves a lot of credit for writing such a smart book. But I am equally impressed by the performance, the voice acting by Ray Porter. I have rarely listened to an audiobook where I can’t separate the narrator and the central character in the book. Most of the folks read the book, performing the dialogs by characters differently every now and then. That wasn’t the case with Porter — he became the character Ryland Grace. The experience it leaves the listener with is absolutely brilliant. I could ignore many of the faults of the book, the plot because I was completely engrossed by the performance.</p>
<p>Sure, even the book is good. I can’t say the same for the writing. But who cares. There’s an innate charm with the way Weir writes his books. Or the way he structures his plot. There’s a lot of science that’s hard to swallow, at times almost at the verge of being stupid. Yet, it doesn’t come out as lazy to me. And I am not alone to feel so; Brandon Sanderson <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/project-hail-mary-review/">writes this in his review</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, what I love that Andy does is he shows that optimism can be compelling as a narrative. I don’t mind the grimdark movement. I think there’s lots of great books that have come out of it. And I like dystopian science fiction quite a bit. Some of my favorite stories are very depressing dystopian stories, such as Harrison Bergeron. But there is a certain electric-fun to optimism. And Andy Weir writes optimistic science fiction, optimistic hard science fiction, even when terrible things are happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I can word the way I feel about Weir’s writing any better. He did that successfully with Martian. And he outdoes himself by being even more audacious with Project Hail Mary.</p>
<p>The book gets four star from me. And an added star just for Roy. No surprise, it’s rated (almost) five star on Audible. Absolutely brilliant!</p>

			 <p>This week saw the schools and offices welcoming the students and employees in-person, and I realised I have entered the post-lockdown phase of the pandemic now. For a body and mind that has gotten used to the sluggish at-home routine, the rush-filled days are exhausting. I haven’t gotten used to this routine yet.</p>
<p>It isn’t as if I am working more. Rather, I must be working a lot less than what I was when I could focus more at home. For the majority of the times, that is. But the mere fact that I am at the office floors surrounded by the buzzing coworker space makes the stay tiring. I can see the same behaviour in my daughter. She was extremely pumped to join the school, and still is. However, even she is drained once she arrives home from the school. Well, her reason might be different – surrounded by friends new and old, she is bursting with energy. She has missed her classrooms. And the busy routine. There’s satisfaction on her tired face.</p>
<p>Is it all bad for me? Well, to be frank, not at all. I have enjoyed the company of coworkers in the last week. The way we work when we can interact face-to-face is very different from when it is all virtual. We take many decisions without planning and booking a time on the calendar; as a result, we close more discussions. The virtual mode of working restrained us through the need to over-plan. Over-schedule. It’s surprising how free I felt when I could simply walk to a person and talk.</p>
<p>Sure, the away-from-home routine has impacted my reading and writing habits, too. Well, to be frank, those habits are impacted for quite some time now. I need to get back, find a window to think in this hectic, unsteady life. It’s not new to me, but it’s funny how a couple of years at home has made me forget the office lifestyle. What was the work-life balance that we talked so much about, again?</p>
<p>Well, that’s a thought to ponder over some other time.</p>

It gives me a chance to think about and share what’s at the top of my mind now.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s a downside. When life keeps me busy, as it has for the past few weeks, I can’t word these letters. But I have stopped making it too much of an issue. It’s ok if I cannot send the letter out. Anyway, I am not doing this to gather a follower base, but to send a personal letter to the few interested friends.</p>

			 <p>iPhone SE is a lazy upgrade — Apple is a boring company. If there is one thing that will dent the juggernaut that is Apple, it is their tendency to play safe to cater to the majority. <em>We need to sell in millions, so we can’t experiment too much on design.</em> I understand the why. Consumer aren’t supposed to care.</p>
<p>The strategy might work in US. Apple might throw numbers to prove that SE sells well worldwide. But all they are doing is to keep a manufacturing unit running since last 2014.</p>
<p>India is an extremely competitive market on price and I am tired of waiting for Apple to price their low end devices well.</p>
<p>SE needs a better, modern design. Be bold and make one custom for smaller devices. Or stay lazy and make iPhone 12 mini your new SE. Or if that&rsquo;s too premium, make iPhone 11 the new SE. But kill those bezels already.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have recently been a lot picky about the stuff I buy. Or the subscriptions I sign up for. Or the projects I undertake. I was never good at it. And I don’t claim that I have mastered the skill now. I still struggle to recognise the price that I would eventually have to pay. First look, the listed cost looks cheap. But I have started asking now, “<a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2022/01/everything-must-be-paid-for-twice/">can I pay the second price</a>?”</p>
<p>The answer is usually <em>a big no</em>. David Cain succinctly words the reasons behind this problem of mine (the above linked essay is a must-read).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe this is one reason our modern lifestyles can feel a little self-defeating sometimes. In our search for fulfillment, we keep paying first prices, creating a correspondingly enormous debt of unpaid second prices. Yet the rewards of any purchase – the reason we buy it at all — stay locked up until both prices are paid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could also closely associate with the side effects of this problem, as David lists them. This made me acutely aware of the gravity of this pilling debt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This scarcity feeling creates one of the major side-effects of our insurmountable second-price debt: we reflexively overindulge in entertainment and other low-second-price pleasures –- phone apps, streaming services, and processed food — even though their rewards are often only marginally better than doing nothing. This stuff is attractive because it takes little effort (and we’re tired from working to pay for so many first prices) but it can eat up a ton of time, depleting the second-price budget even further.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter for how long she has been in the bed. She may have slept a good 10 hours of good night’s sleep, she still has her finger up when I go and wake her up. It is the sleep that she gets in the extra minute that’s dear to her.</p>
<p>We love this little game of ours. When I <em>knowingly</em> wake her up early, and she <em>knowingly</em> raises her finger up. When that minute is up, I act tough and pull her out of the bed. She knows I am acting. I know she knows. Both of us wear a smug smile on our faces.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Micro.blog is a blogging platform built over Hugo, a fast static site engine. Given the way it is structured, every theme created for Hugo can potentially work with the blog hosted by Micro.blog. However, there are a few aspects added to Hugo that are specific to the way things work in Micro.blog. These need to be included as part of the themes to make the most of the features of this platform.</p>
<p>This article presents a non-extensive list of things that should be evaluated and included while porting a theme that is made for Hugo to Micro.blog. I have written this as I dug into the existing themes <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2022/01/23/paper-a-clean.html">while porting Paper theme</a>. As of this writing, a theme is considered as a plug-in in Micro.blog. Hence, many references link back to the way plug-ins work with the platform.</p>
<p>To reiterate, this is not an extensive list. Based on how a theme, that is being ported, is set up, one may need only a few of these steps or may need a few more than those listed below. However, this should be a good start to get a working version of the theme out for testing. If there are any issues or concerns, please reply to our email addresses.</p>
<h2 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h2>
<p>Of course, the article assumes that you have already identified the theme that you want to port. The <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io">Hugo theme Showcase</a> is a good place to check for all the wonderful themes available.</p>
<p>Though you are not required to have a detailed understanding of Hugo to port a theme, the knowledge on the below aspects should be handy.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-themes/59">Custom Theme support in Micro.blog</a></li>
<li>A basic understanding of <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/">Hugo templates</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/">directory structure</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>The first step to get started is to access and clone the repository of the theme to be ported. You can either do this offline on your desktop or directly create a new theme in Micro.blog with mentioning the theme repository URL as Clone URL. You could then select this newly added theme as a custom theme for your <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/09/04/microblog-test-blogs.html">test blog</a>. This allows you to find out what breaks and also validate the additional modifications that you make to the theme.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For a theme to work, you only need a few folders and files — a typical Micro.blog theme directory structure is provided below for reference.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">.
├── theme.toml
├── config.json
├── plugin.json
├── layouts
└── static
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li><code>theme.toml</code> - Contains bare meta information about the theme, like name, description, license, features, author.</li>
<li><code>config.json</code> - Contains any properties required and referenced by the template files of the theme. If the property is to be provided by the user, typically it should be taken as a setting, defined in a separate file.</li>
<li><code>plugin.json</code> - Contains meta information about the custom theme to be displayed as part of plugin repository. It also defines the feature settings that can be provided by user while plugin configuration. Refer to <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/plug-ins/104">official guide on plug-ins</a> for more details about this file.</li>
<li><code>layouts</code> - A folder that stores <code>html</code> templates that defines how views of different content types will be rendered on a website with the style.</li>
<li><code>static</code> - A folder that stores all the static content like CSS, JavaScript, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get rid of all the other unnecessary files and folders and only keep the above-mentioned ones. This will keep the list of files in which changes are to be made manageable.</p>
<p>Before we move ahead, here’s a list of basic template files in the <code>layouts</code> folders that one would modify typically to port a theme.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/_default/list.html</code> - A template that renders pages with multiple pieces of content, this includes the homepage. A homepage can also be independently styled by defining a template <code>index.html</code> in the root directory.</li>
<li><code>/_default/single.html</code> or <code>posts/single.html</code> - A template that renders a page for a single post.</li>
<li><code>/_default/list.archivehtml.html</code> - A template that renders the archive page of your website.</li>
<li><code>/partials/head.html</code> - A template that defines the <code>head</code> section of your final rendered HTML.</li>
<li><code>/partials/header.html</code> - A template that defines the header of your blog. This typically includes the site title, subtitle, navigation menu etc.</li>
<li><code>/partials/footer.html</code> - A template that defines the footer of your blog. This typically includes the copyrights, author information etc.</li>
<li><code>/_default/baseof.html</code> - A base template that stitches all the above defined partials together, including the main sections defined in list and single template pages above.</li>
</ul>
<p>A theme might have all the above files, or have just a subset of these. In case a theme does not provide a particular template file, one from the basic theme (which forms the base of every theme) of Micro.blog is used.</p>
<p>Moreover, make sure you configure the appropriate Hugo Version to be used for your blog. Micro.blog allows two versions of Hugo to be used, 0.54 and 0.91, the latest being relatively new. Many themes may not work with the older 0.54 version of the Hugo, typically indicated by the <code>min_version</code> configuration in the <code>theme.toml</code>. If the value is above 0.54, set the Hugo version to be used as 0.91. This can be done via Design → Hugo Version.</p>
<h2 id="fix-the-broken-pages">Fix the Broken Pages</h2>
<p>Usually, the home page might not render the list of all the posts with the ported templates. This is often due to the wrong selection of the posts. To check the selection, visit the list template mentioned above and fix the file which is fetching all the posts. It should typically look like below where you pull all the regular pages where type is defined as post.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">{{ $pages = where .Site.RegularPages &#34;Type&#34; &#34;post&#34; }}
</code></pre></div><p>A similar fix would also need to be applied to the archive page’s template, if it is defined custom. The archive page would also need styling the components appropriately, as these are all Micro.blog specific classes, not part of the default styling of the theme.</p>
<p>Next, you will have to fix the templates to handle the title-less posts. Most posts published with Micro.blog are, well, micro-posts with no titles. So, wherever a Title is referenced, it should be wrapped in a <code>{{ if .Title }}</code> condition. So, the title reference at every place should read like below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">{{ if .Title }}
	&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">h2</span>&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">h2</span>&gt;
{{ end }}
</code></pre></div><p>The title-less posts might also need minor styling fixes. A typical pitfall is when a post permalink is only available with title. So, a micro-post requires a different element to carry the permalink, mostly the date-time of the post.</p>
<p>Another aspect that is typically broken is rendering of the taxonomy. Most of the themes in Hugo use tags to define the taxonomy. Micro.blog uses categories and hence need to fetch them differently. So at every place a template mentions tags, mostly on list template, archives template and single template, replace them with categories. This primarily involves replacing all the references of <code>.Params.tags</code> with <code>.Params.categories</code>.</p>
<p>With these changes handled, you should have a working website that renders correctly. However, it is still not customised to include the benefits that Micro.blog brings to the table.</p>
<h2 id="add-microblog-specific-tags">Add Micro.blog Specific Tags</h2>
<p>Micro.blog packs the key IndieWeb principles, like IndieAuth, MicroPub, Webmentions, out-of-box for all websites hosted with the platform. However, this does involve defining a few relevant aspects at appropriate places. In addition, the platform is also rich in the ways a user not adept with coding can customise their website to their liking, with support for providing custom CSS, footer and plug-ins.

<p>The difficulty involved in porting a Hugo theme to Micro.blog depends completely on the complexity of the original theme. Though it is difficult to extensively cover all the changes required, fixing the things that are broken and adding support for the Micro.blog specific features and tags is all it takes. This article attempted to list down the majority of the identified changes.</p>
<p>In the future, the way of including the Micro.blog specific changes may be simplified significantly. This article would be updated accordingly to reflect the same. However, the awareness of the changes being done allows one to appreciate the hidden complexity and beauty of the platform that is Micro.blog.</p>

			 <p>I find <a href="https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/historyculture/douglas-corrigan.htm">the story of Douglas Corrigan</a> pretty fascinating and inspiring. Sometimes the wrong way is the right way. All that matters is your intention and people’s perception.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having flown his nine year-old, $900 Curtiss Robin to New York, Corrigan fueled up and took off after announcing that he planned to return to Los Angeles. When next heard from, Corrigan and his old plane were in Dublin, Ireland, where he said, &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Corrigan. I left New York yesterday morning headed for California, but I got mixed up in the clouds and must have flown the wrong way.&rdquo; And so was born the wry legend of &ldquo;Wrong Way&rdquo; Corrigan.</p>

			 <p>I am on a #30day challenge of not accessing any of the social timelines and have signed out from them in all my browsers. I will continue to post to my blog, and hence cross-post to Twitter. But to aid myself to stay away from timeline, I won’t access the mention page either. So, no replies.</p>
<p>I want to understand what impact the timelines have on my focus — I have been struggling with that since the last few months. It’s time to take some action.</p>
<p>Are social media timelines the only cause? I’m sure they are not. But my intension is to find out if they are <em>one of the causes</em> and to what extent.</p>
<p>I do intend to catch up on the blog feeds though, and for the next 30 days, I will have to use emails to both send the responses. You, too, can send any responses to my posts <a href="mailto:reply@amitgawande.com">through email here</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have settled on a platform for my blog which works the best for me — Micro.blog. There are reasons why the other platforms don&rsquo;t interest me. And I want to talk about them. Why now, you say? Well, recent and sudden interest in the Write.as platform among the folks I follow the words from made me momentarily pause. So here&rsquo;s the write up, first on why what in Micro.blog works for me.</p>
<p>For starter, it suits well for both the micro and long-form posts. It has apps for all platforms that I primarily use Mac and Android (Web is good for Windows, though I would still love an app there). Quick notes are best made with the apps, especially so from smartphone. For such posts that are long, titled, Ulysses works perfectly well for me. No other CMS can ever work as well as a native application.</p>
<p>The platform is built on Hugo. And I <em>love</em> Hugo. I hosted my blog for the longest with Hugo. I love the submodule systems with Hugo. Building extensions in your templates is so easy, and I have gotten comfortable with it. For a few, it might be <code>PHP</code> and WordPress. However, I could never get comfortable with that.</p>
<p>Manton has added just enough around Hugo to make it even more useful — the APIs, the apps, the social aspects, the open plug-in and theming systems and, the most valuable, its community. I visit the platform for inspiration, and many posts start right there. All this makes Micro.blog a lot more powerful, getting rid of the issues I had with Hugo, mainly the editing workflow with the static site. And I am not even talking about the smarter features life filters, bookmarks, microcasts, newsletters and bookshelves.</p>
<p>Do I use all of them? Of course, not. But the fact that one plan provides me so much over and above the basic blogging functionality is priceless for me.</p>
<h3 id="but-what-about-other-platforms">But what about other platforms?</h3>
<p>I have hopped through a lot more platforms than what I am proud of. So, I know what works, and doesn’t work for me. Let me be brief and focus only on what doesn’t work for me with the most frequently talked ones. I don’t want to consider the costing aspects — I can work a way to use them so that they cost effectively the same.</p>
<p>The below notes also give me a ready reference when I get lured by a new platform next time.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress</a> is too busy, too bloated for my liking. I don’t like the CMS. I don’t like the themes. For my style of blogging, frequent quick posts than scheduled thought-out essays, the options and features become a hinderance. I don’t want to think about the title or the tags or the categories or the url. Or excerpt. Sure, I can customise this system just to get it right. But I don’t know (neither do I like) <code>PHP</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> blog looks pretty. Polished. Majority of my posts aren’t that. And again, it bundles too many features that I just can’t connect with. I am not a media publishing house trying to build a business with my blog. I am a dumb person with very basic needs. No “audience”. No business.</p>
<p><a href="https://blot.im">Blot</a> is brilliant. Another of those services I have a lot of love for, driven also from my respect to David, the mind behind the service. A brilliant guy, just like his service. But my editing workflow is just not files driven. When I write, I don’t always do that in my text editor. I want a web editor. I want apps. And, having said that, I also want text editors. Not something that Blot supports currently. For some, that’s the ultimate selling point of the service. Not for me.</p>
<p>What about <a href="http://write.as/">Write.as</a>, the recent entrant? Well, I like the service. I like the simplicity of the editor (I wish Manton got inspired from this one). But it feels far too fragmented. Each feature is a different product. I had noted this recently about the service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I land on a page which is a blank one with a blinking cursor. Brilliant! But what next? There&rsquo;s nothing else if you don&rsquo;t know where to go. I can see my blog posts, edit them. Do you want the community? There is a different product. Pictures you say? That&rsquo;s another different product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The workflow is not natural to me. It is a nice, easy service. But it doesn’t work for me. Plus, it lacks the app support. Without mobile apps, I just can’t publish those quick notes anymore.</p>
<p>Of course, I could pick and choose, make multiple platforms host different types of posts for me. I have done that. But I have realised, after a lot of pain, that it’s another hurdle in my posting workflow. Any decision my mind is to make before publishing slows it down, killing my writing productivity completely.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it’s a wonderful time to be blogging again. There’s such a rich set of platforms that can suit every writer’s style. For me, though, Micro.blog works the best, and I am going to stick with it for now. Does that mean I will <em>never</em> consider new or even the above platforms? Well, knowing me, I can never say never.</p>

			 <p>Last week, my whole family, near and distant, got together for my cousin’s wedding, and it kept me completely exhausted throughout this week. The venue for the wedding was unfamiliar to me and I am never comfortable at such places. I can never settle into any routinue of sorts, messing up my eating and sleeping habits, and invariably my body. The journey with a train to and from the destination, though, was wonderful. I have always had a fascination for the train rides, especially ones overnight. To be a resident of a world on wheels for a few hours is welcome — it distances you from all your regular thoughts. Each station the train halts at exhibits a different personality, lays out its own unique beauty for the traveling strangers. The <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2022/02/05/a-morning-during.html">skies in the dawns remain beautiful</a>, the vacant stations late at nights are equally mesmerising.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All said, notwithstanding the tiredness the event left me with, the train ride gave me enough memories to remember the two nights of the journey by. The week also saw me complete another of my <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/categories/30-day/">#30day</a> challenges. I am proud of this one, I learned so much. And I might have continued the challenge if it wasn’t for the hectic week. I will not, however, take photo-a-day as a challenge now. I want to make it regular, part of my blogging habit.</p>
<p>What #30day challenge should I sign up for next, then? Anyway, last week was a slow writing week in terms of number of posts. But in terms of number of words, I wrote more than what’s usual for me.</p>

			 <p>I like the new Galaxy S22 devices, especially the non-Ultra ones. If the rumour that Samsung might finally launch with Snapdragon processor in India is true, I might seriously consider the non-plus variant. Plus the downslide that OnePlus is on makes this decision a lot easier.</p>

			 <p>I now have 3 posts in draft, unpublished, because I&rsquo;m not yet satisfied. Another reason why I&rsquo;ve more micro posts than the long-form ones. I feel a sense of attachment to the stuff I post on my blog. The stuff I wrote on Twitter and other platform <em>can</em> get lost. Literally.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware that there&rsquo;s a way to create drafts with Write.as. With no option in the editor to save a post in-works as draft, I always thought it wasn&rsquo;t possible. I should read a bit first before deciding on what I know. In fairness, though, the workflow is different, slightly reverse from all other #platforms. You basically publish a post and expect it to be a draft as it was done anonymously.</p>
<p>Anyway, every time I access Write.as, everything looks too fragmented to me. I land on a page which is a blank one with a blinking cursor. Brilliant! But what next? There&rsquo;s nothing else if you don&rsquo;t know where to go. I can see my blog posts, edit them. <em>Do you want the community?</em> There is a different product. <em>Pictures you say?</em> That&rsquo;s another different product.</p>
<p>For example, I still wonder how do I add an image here? Can I? Or is the image&rsquo;s workflow separate? Possibly, it is part of the Rich editor available as a Pro feature?</p>
<p>All said, this is a nice editor.</p>

			 <p>I replaced my glasses today after going through the tiring trouble of shopping for them. There is no other process for me that’s so meaningless. What’s the most important thing in a spectacle? The lenses. How much percentage of time do I spend on deciding on the lens? Not more than 5%.</p>
<p>And shopping for the eyeglass frame then is <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2018/10/07/131400.html">shopping</a> <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2019/10/05/234000.html">for fashion</a>, which I have no sense for. What I like, I am told, doesn’t look good on me. It’s either too big. Or too small. What I am told looks good, I am not comfortable wearing that. Tired, I purchase one from whatever remains. <em>What are clothes for if not just for covering my body</em>, my brain consoles my crying mind each time.</p>
<p>That’s how my shopping for a frame for my glasses goes. <em>What is the frame for if not just for holding the lenses within</em>.</p>

			 <p>I have settled onto an easy workflow for publishing newsletters with Micro.blog.

I do wish though that there was an archive of the issues that I could share with the subscribers so that they know what they are signing up for.</p>
<p>Also, unfortunately the issue with the replies bouncing back has still not been fixed. Without that, I have no way to connect with the readers.</p>
<p>The way things stand, the support for newsletter in Micro.blog is extremely bare today. But the workflow remains one that I am most comfortable with. I just wish a few things were different and better.</p>

			 <p>I have been busy tinkering with many things these last few days. I don’t like when this happens because I halt everything else. I don’t read — that invariably leads to me writing less. My routine is completely messed up. <em>No early to bed and early to rise</em>. I stay awake unnecessarily, and when I eventually sleep, it is with a mind full of thoughts, working on stuff yet undone. No surprise, the sleep is not peaceful.</p>
<p>I cozy up to all the bad habits. No control on eating or control on my smartphone usage. Every good habit that was picked up is forgotten again. Yikes!</p>
<p>I find it curious that being productive mars my health more often. I need to learn to shut myself down on time. Learn to say no to additional work, notwithstanding the fun I am having.</p>

			 <p>I have released a new <strong>version 1.0.2</strong> of the <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/43">Paper theme</a> today, which addresses the reported issues and suggestions <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2022/01/23/paper-a-clean.html">since the first release yesterday</a>. Here are the changes, in brief.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support to include replies on individual posts</li>
<li>Added the configuration of social icons as plug-in setting</li>
<li>Updated the styling to display categories along with posts</li>
<li>Updated documentation to include installation steps</li>
<li>Fixed styling of images on smaller screens</li>
</ul>
<p>You can go to the Plug-ins section in Micro.blog and click “Upgrade” once the option is available. You will have to reconfigure (<em>for the last time, hopefully</em>) the social IDs in the settings of the plug-in. No need to modify the <code>config.json</code>, anymore. This also means the configurations will not be lost during the future upgrades.</p>
<p>I am thrilled with all the feedback that I have received. Paper is a beautifully designed theme, something I can take no credit for. At the same time, I am glad I could make it simpler for others to adopt it.</p>

			 <p>After playing around briefly to understand how to bring a theme made for Hugo to Micro.blog, I have finally ported one that I love. Today, I am ready to share it with the Micro.blog community. The theme is called <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/43">Paper</a> and goes with a tagline “simple, clean, flexible”. You can check for yourself in the screenshot below, or see it live at <a href="https://amit-test.micro.blog">my test blog</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I am a big fan of clean themes that are minimal, yet impressive. Paper is one such theme — I had used it earlier when I was hosting this blog with Hugo. Although it looks minimal, it isn’t so in the way it works. It has a simple, yet signature header, a built-in dark mode support with a beautiful toggle and a clean <em>black &amp; white</em> look.</p>
<p>I have added the first version of this theme to the plug-ins directory so that you can <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/43">install it directly as a plugin</a>. <del>It works with both Hugo versions that Micro.blog supports (0.54 and 0.91)</del> [<strong>Update</strong>]: An issue was reported while using the theme with Hugo version 0.54. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, until further update, the theme supports only version 0.91 of Hugo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. However, here are a few points to remember before you install the theme.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uninstall any theme that you have installed as a plugin. Set you current theme to blank and Hugo Version to 0.91 in the design section of your blog. Make sure there are no other conflicting custom CSS configured for the previous theme. Then install the Paper theme from the plugin directory. Once the theme is successfully installed, you can configure the social icons displayed in the header by modifying the available options in <code>config.json</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s already a brilliant selection of themes available for Micro.blog and I am excited to see the support grow further with every passing day. I hope you like this and a few folks benefit from it. If you do, I would love to hear from you.</p>

<p>I love how when the mind gets bogged down with too many thoughts, spilling it all out onto a paper always helps declutter it. But, these are some of the rawest, most personal of the thoughts.

<p>Theoretically, hobbies should be among the most intrinsically motivated things we could do—they are the work we choose to do when we could be doing anything. But the validation we get from others online, and the validation we get from our culture writ large for spending our free time in a productive, virtuous way, muddies that motivation.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>“Do what you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life,” goes a mantra for success – an adage that is unfortunately overrated, though. A person can’t always do what she loves to do. Rather, there are very few fortunate folks who do just what they want to do in their life. An extension to that adage is <em>love what you do</em>. Well, nor can one always love what she does. Rather, most folks hate what they do. They do it because they <em>have to</em> do it.</p>
<p>“Passion is the genesis of genius,” says Tony Robbins. Aha, that is precisely the reason we aren’t surrounded by geniuses. The majority of us are stuck doing something for which we have no passion.</p>
<p>That is such a cynical attitude, you say? Sure. But, it also is the reality of our world. Should we then give up? Far from that, actually. What one should do is to find out <em>why</em> they are doing what they are doing. For some, it might be the money. Or a sense of comfort. For many, it might be the best among the available options. Find peace with what you do. That is the first step to reach a phase in your life when you can do what you love to do.</p>
<p>There is also the fact that what you love can very well be temporary. It takes time to find your passion. What you think is your passion may very well be a fleeting interest. As Derek Sivers <a href="#">reminds us</a>, we can’t always depend on our current opinions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Our) former self is not always right. We shouldn’t preserve our first opinions as if they reflect our pure, untarnished, true nature. They’re often just the result of inexperience or a temporary phase. Old opinions shouldn’t define who we are in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the contentedness, though passing, that matters the most. Do what makes you feel contented, what gives you a good night’s sleep.</p>
<p>That said, there is, of course, another way. Stick to what you are passionate about. Switch paths when your passion changes. There will be hardships because doing what <em>you think</em> you love is not easy. But being satisfied never is. Be firm, stay strong.</p>
<p>So, which way do you prefer?</p>

			 <p>What is a productive day? Well, when it is closer to your bedtime, and you feel good inside for the day gone by, you have had a productive day. It doesn’t matter then how much you achieved in the day. Or how many of the planned tasks you ticked off. What matters is how the waking hours make you feel.</p>
<p>Plans are like the lane markings on the roads. It is beneficial to stick to them, follow guidelines around them. But often <em>to move ahead</em>, you have to put on the indicators and cross over such markers. You can’t let them become hinderances that slow you down, hold you back.</p>

<p>The title of “The Best Pen” is a weighty one—not everyone wants the same things from their pens, and what makes for one person’s perfect pen may be intolerable to another. It’s also true that different types of pens aren’t directly comparable.</p>

			 <p>Ben wrote <a href="https://werd.io/2022/everyone-should-blog">a wonderful post</a> suggesting, <em>reminding</em>, that everyone should blog, should write. I always connect, and have done so for long, with this specific sentiment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s no such thing as writing too much: your voice is important, your perspective is different, and you should put it out there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminded me of <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2018/02/13/215000.html">a post I had written</a> that shared a similar sentiment — we all can, and should, write. This particular passage that I had written, unfortunately, still holds true for many.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s saddening to see people resist the efforts to pen the words they think of. They go after what others have written, beautiful nevertheless, but at the cost of it being not real, fake. They underestimate the power of conveying one’s own feelings in whichever way possible. The words, their structure won’t matter much then. And that is one way one can start writing.</p>

			 <p>I recently changed the newsletter to a weekly digest instead of every long-form posts with Micro.blog. A fixed schedule is better for me than thinking about whether to include as part of the newsletter every time I post a post with a title. Until there is a better control (via categories) on what posts I can schedule for delivery, I want to avoid risking this particular setting.</p>
<p>That said, I didn’t really like the way the first digest looked. It was… mhmm … messy. Maybe a bit more control over the elements, like title etc. would be good. Without that, to make the digest look slightly better, here’s the custom CSS that I have added currently.</p>

<p><strong>Update [24 April 2022]</strong>: Fixed the issue with blockquotes being hidden due to the selection for headers being mistakenly applied to the blockquotes too. This uses the recently added CSS selectors for <code>.microblog_header</code> and <code>.microblog_footer</code>.</p>

			 <p>Today’s posts mark the completion of 30 days of daily posting on my blog. It wasn’t a planned challenge. But I wanted to attempt a routine, in public, of sorts. Prone to miss at least a day occasionally, a streak of any kind is always difficult for me. Plus, a good thing is that I didn’t have to schedule any posts just to make sure I don’t skip a day. I had written all the posts on the day they are visible on the blog. Well, in Indian Standard Time, that is. Even the long-form essays.</p>
<p>With post-a-day done, can I take up another 30-day challenge? I always wanted to post at least a picture every day. But, I am not too much into photography. Or rather, I am not good at it. Plus the worsening environment outside with Omicron in the air, it becomes a tad more difficult to find different places every day. What else?</p>

<p>I have come to a realization recently. Blogs have made web boring. Think about it. Every blog looks the same. All themes are more or less the same. A slight layout change here. A margin or padding there. Varied columns. But all look the same to me. You know that <em>you are reading a blog</em>.</p>
<p>Imagine if every page was custom. Well, let me help you. Check <a href="http://aegir.org">this site by Aegir</a>. No, don&rsquo;t just look at the homepage. Look at every post.

<p>Since my niece was born on this day three years ago today, the new year celebrations have been quite unfamiliar for us. The whole world celebrates along with us as she grows a year old, every year. Or so we have convinced her and her parents. This year is no different, albeit a tad muted. But still, the folks all-around plan to celebrate.</p>
<p>Knowing how all my plans for 2020 were mercilessly crushed by the pandemic, I had no expectations from 2021. I knew it was going to be more of the same dreadful cycle of panic, despair, and hope. At the same time, I also wished I and all my dear ones sail through, see the end of the year.</p>
<p>As I sit here today, looking at the year gone by, all I can do is smile. It began with a phase as dark as my family had ever seen. But it brought us all close, gave us the courage to stay strong. We got back on our feet, stronger. We learned to live with the virus, masked whenever outside. Vaccinating ourselves. Slowly, gradually, we wandered, unhesitant, outside our homes. Each one of us established our own new rules, routines, and traditions around travel.</p>
<p>We met our friends, got nostalgic for the days that we had left behind. We got hungry, got drunk and laughed our hearts out. I witness my office welcome my colleagues, the floors, and pantries reverberating with grumbles again.</p>
<p>I am fortunate I could do all of that. And a lot more. That I watch my crazy friends share their plans for celebrations with booze and snacks. That I would watch the skies light up with fireworks one more time. I am fortunate that I am about to get ready and join my family to celebrate my niece growing older by another year.</p>
<p>And if you are reading this, know that, in one way or the other, you are too. Just look back and find out why.</p>
<p>Resilience. And <em>kismet</em>. The two words I would remember 2021 by. Wish you a happy new year, you all!</p>

			 <p>It has been the third day in a row today that I decided to sleep early, get back to routine and failed. I just can’t stop myself from doing what I am doing at my system. Until last week, I used to lay down onto my bed with my Kindle and was sound sleep at the same time every time. That hasn’t been the case for this part few days.</p>
<p>I know what I need to do. I can’t make myself do it. Sure, I have my reasons why I am going late to bed. Nonetheless, I don’t like that a bit.</p>
<p>Sleep routine is a flaky thing — disturb it ever so slightly, and it absolutely falls apart. And takes down the whole next day with it.</p>

			 <p>I decided against <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2021/12/29/an-inner-monologue.html">replacing my theme</a> with something entirely new. I have too many custom components baked in currently that <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2021/09/09/interesting-but-i.html">I don’t have time</a> to replicate afresh. Plus, all the feedback from folks helped me convince myself that what I have is good enough.</p>
<p>But, I have refreshed a few aspects in the existing theme. As advised by Khalid, I started with a typeface and replaced it with a serif one. It looks a lot bolder to me. A few clean-ups around accent colours. And a lot of moving stuff around.</p>
<p>What I have, thus, is something that looks different, yet is the same. The journey is incomplete yet, there are many ugly corners that need clean-up. But I will get to those as time permits.</p>

			 <p>An inner monologue around my site’s theme to follow. I have grown bored by looking at my current theme. Not that I don&rsquo;t like it, it just needs a reset. This has been how the site looks for a couple of years now. It looks so bland. Not playful. Not <em>personal</em>. There is no character.</p>
<p>Over the year, I have added so much stuff to the theme. It does not, at all, resemble what I started with. It feels hacky all around. I have realised I can’t create anything polished, so I prefer not to build something totally custom. I prefer anything that comes ready-made. But that’s tricky as these are still early days for theming with Micro.blog. I like a couple, but neither is perfect. Shall I start with one and personalise in limit? Do I want to take the project up?</p>
<p>I know, I know. “It is the words that matter and not what’s around.” &amp; “Make the content beautiful, not the container” &amp; blah blah.</p>
<p>I get it. That’s the writer in me speaking. But <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2021/08/16/i-am-a.html">the developer in me</a> is craving for change. Can I hold him back?</p>

Simple, yet so poignant. I wish I could live my life being aware of this somewhere at the back of mind. It’s not the most efficient way to get the results every time. Being cognisant however that halting is an option always helps.</p>
<p>Our society does not look at “giving up” respectfully. Especially if one does so without being successful. But cashing out early, accepting the failure, is always a sensible option.</p>
<p>Giving up early is problematic. But hanging on just to delay the inevitable is foolish.</p>

			 <p>I love emails, sending and receiving them. In today’s world of social timelines where you shout into a void and expect an echo back, the medium of email feels a lot more personal. Drafting a long email to a friend today reminded me of the time when I wrote letters to my family, a few pages long. When we carefully selected and penned the words to convey the emotions we were living through. Physical letters were replaced by their digital form, the email, but the manner we communicated didn’t change.</p>
<p>With email, there’s no urgency, no pressure of read receipts and associated expectations for response. And when the response does arrive, there’s a feeling of connectedness. Instant messages, those words we spurt in burst, don’t exude that sense of affinity. A well-thought email does; it makes you mindful of the fact that someone cares.</p>
<p>One is a letter, another is messaging. It’s unfortunate that we have forgotten how to draft the former. I wish I knew more people who shared my liking for this medium.</p>

			 <p>I <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2021/12/10/after-a-welcome.html">recently cribbed</a> about how my smartphone was becoming the pesky little distractor again. I was planning to go back into a shell, keeping the device away from me for longer durations. However, I realised I may change the way and try being mindful this time.</p>
<p>I was hit by this thought during my guided meditation session today, when I came across this insightful observation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In trying to bend our will to that which is helpful, we strengthen our ego. In letting go of the things that are unhelpful, we free ourselves of our ego. Same intention. Different outcome.</p>
<p>We depend on our willpower to control our situation. We achieve the results but don’t train our minds. As a result, we harden our habits and behaviour. What if we change our approach. What if we acknowledge the unhealthy thought. But rather than becoming more rigid, we become softer. Rather than rejecting, resisting, we let go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting. I tend to depend on my willpower to not fall for the poor habits. That hasn’t worked well for me — I avoid the habits for some time, but soon am back to natural poor state. My problems with my smartphone are an example of this behaviour. So, why not accept that my device is a bugger? Be mindful of the fact that my subconscious reaches out for the device frequently. And when it does, acknowledge it and let it go.</p>
<p>Be mindful of the attraction, but not be burdened by willing self into resistance. Remind self of the negative outcome and detach. Can I train my mind to not fall for the attraction but ignore it naturally?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One approach is rigid, based on will, based on control. Other approach is based on awareness. Recognising the thoughts that are helpful and engaging with them. Recognising the thoughts that are unhelpful and letting them go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no idea if this would work for me. Who do I trust more, my willpower or my ability to be mindful? I have seen my willpower falter. Maybe I should give mindfulness a try this time. That’s what I have decided to do.</p>

			 <p>I published <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2021/12/13/sydney-didnt-welcome.html">the first (planned) issue of the newsletter</a> via Micro.blog today about my first evening in Sydney. I’d scheduled the post &amp; it worked as expected. Sure, I want to improve the styling of the emails. But it’s good to post at a single place. All feedback welcome!</p>

			 <p>I love Pringles <em>crisps</em>. But the way they stack up, I could never eat them in a bunch — I feel guilty to eat more. As if I am emptying the can sooner and denying others of this wonderful cooked Potato. Fascinating how the container impacts your behaviour. Equally fascinating is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pringles#History">the history of this brand of snacks</a>. For example, the attempt was “to develop a new kind of potato chips to address consumer complaints about broken, greasy, and stale chips, as well as air in the bags”.</p>
<p>Well, chips haven’t changed much. And they didn’t even want to — as if they wanted to make the greasiness their identity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The product was originally known as Pringles Newfangled Potato Chips, but other snack manufacturers objected, saying Pringles failed to meet the definition of a potato &ldquo;chip&rdquo; since they were made from a potato-based dough rather than being sliced from potatoes like &ldquo;real&rdquo; potato chips.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the technicality aside (yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_paraboloid">the shape of the crisp</a> has a name), they just don’t taste like chips. They are different. And yet, “no one can eat just one”.</p>

			 <p>After a welcome phase of independence from my smartphone, I am back to fidgeting unnecessarily with the device. I keep it close to me when I shouldn’t. Notifications have started pestering me again. They hack my focus away. I know the reason, I have given up on my resolve to not hand over the control. It didn’t happen instantaneously. It happened gradually, over time. Now I feel the burning sensation like a slowly boiling frog.</p>
<p>There was a time when I used to go to any extends to stay away from the device. Keep it in the next room. No apps. No notifications. <em>Never</em> next to the bed. YouTube disabled. And on and on. Eventually, every time I picked it, a bulb lighted in my brain reminding me to not surrender.</p>
<p>And the pesky device conquered those defences one by one, without me realising. It started with a few apps. Then their notifications. Then a need to watch and share a YouTube video from the device. Before I realised, I was wishing good night to my phone lying in the bed.</p>
<p>Today, I was on my computer, the powerful personal computer which can cater to all my commands. But I reached out, as if out of habit, to the smartphone just to peek at those apps, the web versions of which I had just visited. I knew I was sick again.</p>
<p>My smartphone has become the most personal thing I own, but also the one I need to frequently stay away the farthest from.</p>

			 <p>As much as I love Ghost as a blogging platform, I hate maintaining an additional platform. I needed to keep it on because it provided a wonderful way to deliver newsletters as an extension to a regular blog. Another reason I used it was the editor — it is hands-down the best web editor interface out there. But, I never draft my newsletter posts directly in the web interface anymore. I use Ulysses for all forms of writing, and <em>I love it</em>.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2021/12/07/an-easy-upgrade.html">Micro.blog supporting the email newsletters</a>, I can <em>again</em> bring all my writing to a single place.

			 <p>Assuming Manton is <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/12/04/putting-the-final.html">about to announce</a> some way of emailing posts or digest of post to the subscribers of Micro.blog hosted blogs, here’s how I wish it works. Email is just another cross-posting option. I know it’s tricky, and it will not work that way given Micro.blog, as timeline, also supports feeds from external blogging hosts. But here’s how I hope it works for it to be useful for me.</p>
<p>The writer selects a category (or a group of categories) for emailing. The posts she publishes under those categories are emailed to the subscribers. Subscribers decide whether they want an email for every post or for a digest of the posts (on a defined schedule — daily, weekly).</p>
<p>This would be a good start, everything else can come later. I have no idea if this is even a feature Manton is working on. But he says it’s “totally unique”. So, I am hoping it works very different from typical newsletter services.</p>

			 <p>I am back to using Mach3 by Gillette. Having tried everything, this razor still gives me the most comfortable shave. I don’t love money-hungry tactics of Gillette, but am glad they made this model.</p>
<p>There was a time when I used single blade safety razors. When Gillette launched the dual-blade razors. I thought <em>it’s double the blades, this has to be better</em>. It wasn’t. Later, I could finally <em>afford</em> Mac3, and I used it for the longest period of time. There was no need to shift, it suited me.</p>
<p>Then the craze for Indie, hip brands with products targeting “bros” engulfed India too. Search for a razor on Amazon and you will be bombarded with a slew of funnily named brands selling grooming products for mens. All claimed quality and affordability. Most targeted Gillette. Feeling burdened with guilt of not supporting newer brands, I switched. I started using a 5 blade razor from one such brand. And then kept hopping for a couple of years. Razor shopping soon became a hobby, and then slowly turned into a nightmare.</p>
<p>Eventually, I gave up and went back to Gillette. First to their pricey 5-blade razors and finally to Mach3. I realised something after this period. A razor with more blades doesn’t always mean better shave. <em>More doesn’t always mean better.</em></p>
<p>So in short, I am done feeling guilty for using a product from a brand that’s hated a lot. It works for me, so I use it.</p>

Doesn’t matter how much we try, we can never master time. It reminds you throughout the book that you don’t <em>have</em> time, but time is what you <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>I have lost interest for WordPress, it has become a behemoth. There are too many features that a blogger would need.

			 <p>Every time the grinds of the daily life take toll over me, I travel to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabaleshwar">a place close by</a> with my family and friends. The last weekend was another such occasion.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I love this place not because it is a perfect family getaway (that it is), but because it is easy to travel to, and so there is not too much planning needed. Most trips get burdensome by the sheer pain of planning so much, so ahead of time. I enjoy the travels where that’s not the case, especially when I have no interest to be a typical tourist and go spot hunting.</p>
<p>The purpose of one’s visit is what matters at the end. If it is to find out everything of interest in a place, sure, go sign up for a hectic few days. Even I do that at times. But, why do that when irrespective of how much you roam around, you can never cover all the interesting places, anyway? The tourists flocking around an attraction kills it for me. It is just a place of business. I prefer the turn en route where no one halts. Or the point which hasn’t got any fancy name yet.</p>
<p>Anyway, I know every nook and corner of this resort I stayed in. My family and I have visited every spot of interest in the place, and so can selectively just visit those that <em>affect us</em>. We did just that this time, too. Maybe, I am different. I am glad that my family is just like me. Crazy different “tourists” that travel <em>for</em> the experience, not <em>with</em> a checklist!</p>
<p>Here are a couple of more pictures from the relaxing trip.</p>

			 <p>While on my morning walk today, I came across a kid who was cycling around our gated community. I see him every day, alone, free — every time I see him, I know he’s enjoying his cycling. Today at a turn, I saw him sitting on the ground, his tumbled cycle next to him. I could see a lady with headphones and a couple busy with their chatters pass by him. The kid was staring down, scratching his knee, focused within.</p>
<p>I felt he wasn’t looking at anything particular, but rather was sad. Maybe he did look at a few people, with expectations, as they passed him by earlier, wishing someone to help him pick his cycle up. Maybe he had his expectations from humanity broken.</p>
<p>Anyway, as I came close to him, I asked him he was fine. All it took was my first word, and he was up on his feet, trying to pick his cycle. Once he gave me his permission to touch his cycle, I helped him get it up on its wheels. He adjusted his tiny spectacles over his nose with his wrist, mumbled a few words and paddled along. I soon saw him chasing pigeons with his cycle, the birds not flying away but hopping around. It looked as if the friends often played this game. In my opinion, his tumble today was a test that we adults failed.</p>
<p>What have we become as a Soceity that we prefer to remain plugged in to our digital worlds, that we don’t even acknowledge a saddened kid who simply needs a nudge to get back to enjoying the realities of life?</p>

			 <p>I feel I have been struggling to find quiet time to read and write recently. I can blame it on many things, but I know within that I am to blame for this feeling. When I get time, I waste it. I convince myself that I need to relax first to get in the groove before I can write or read. I have been relaxing for a few weeks now, and it has only made me more tired.</p>
<p>This leaves me frustrated. Lazy consumption of other’s work is meaningless if it does not trigger any thought. I do that the most these days. I read, but I do not think. I write, but they are shallow thoughts. When do I spend time to churn a few ideas? To word them into something profound? You should write what feels right, I understand. But if it is only the deserts you chomp on, you won’t feel satiated after a point.</p>
<p>I need action, both to my mind and my body. Isn’t it curious that long phases of inactiveness can slowly wear them down? Both readily slide back to their lazy defaults. I need to be strong to push back and to make them move their asses.</p>
<p>Without that, what I have is a dull mind and a couch-clinging body.</p>

			 <p>Now that <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com/2021/11/19/113813.html?title=markdownInDrummer">Drummer supports Markdown</a>, I find it&rsquo;s a nice change overall. There are times when I invariably want the power of Markdown while writing some long posts. It&rsquo;s good that Drummer has that option now. I also like how Dave is implementing it &ndash; it&rsquo;s just a new node type. More I think about that, it feels very similar to WordPress' block-editor, but much better and simple. Even with this though, here&rsquo;s how I summarize my thought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not want to unnecessarily hamper the simplicity of posting with Drummer. That lack of complexity is this system&rsquo;s USP.</p>

<p>I finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780446670111">Einstein&rsquo;s Dreams</a> by Alan Lightman today. This is a wonderful collection of thought experiments around our perception of time. The summary of the book says it&rsquo;s a collage of stories &ndash; but there aren&rsquo;t stories. With each &ldquo;story&rdquo;, the author <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8933.Alan_Lightman">Alan Lightman</a> instils a fascinating possibility for the concept of time being something uniquely different. What if everyone settles on their view of time? What if it is always in the past? Or always in the future? Or with just a day of life? It&rsquo;s a thought-provoking list.</p>
<p>All these 30 dreams are poetic vignettes that paint the varied interpretations of time. They evoke emotions through vivid narration of people&rsquo;s lives in such a world and their surroundings. I paused after each chapter, pondering over the impact existence of such realities could have.</p>
<p>At the surface, sure, these are just fictional stories. But dig deep, and you may be able to draw a parallel with realities of our world. With our perception of time. This is a beautifully written, short but profound read! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 📚</p>

			 <p>I finished listening to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37786022-storyworthy">Storyworthy by Matthew Dicks</a> and I instantly wanted to purchase the eBook version of the book too. This is one of those few books that are best read as both audio and text version. The audio brings out Matthew’s expertise as a storyteller — you realise how powerful the medium of storytelling is. However, <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com/2021/10/26/104336.html?title=audiobooksAndEbooks">as I had recently complained</a>, it doesn’t give me enough chance to make notes from. Or to go back to those key sections and read them again.</p>
<p>I am not a storyteller by profession. I don’t get on a stage to narrate a story from my life to a group of strangers. Rather, I can’t even do that if I wanted to — the introvert in me shudders even thinking about it. But I do like to tell stories to the people I am comfortable with. To my family, my friends, my colleagues. And what Matthew attempts to narrate in this book is how to do that better.</p>
<p>But it’s not the “how to tell better stories” part that I found helpful. It is how to find those story-worthy moments from your life that had me excited. Matthew has a very natural, effortless way of conveying the methodical ways to identify, prepare and tell your stories easily. You would expect that, he is a teacher first, after all.</p>
<p>At the same time, he is also a writer and a renowned storyteller, though. So, listening to him tell his stories and use them as a tool to teach the process behind was fascinating. He has mastered the art over his many shows, and he lays out everything he has learnt through his experience for his readers to benefit from. He holds back nothing.</p>
<p>I have made so many notes, and I will make a many more when I <em>read</em> this book a second time. One thing, I have got homework for life now. And I don’t complain.</p>
<p>You should read this book even if, like me, you have no intention ever to tell your stories to strangers. Because, as Matthew says, there come moments in our life when we do tell our stories. So, instead of being terrible at it, we can attempt to do slightly better. Maybe we will not bore a few people the next time we ramble along in front of them. A must-read for me. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t remember the last book before <a href="https://sive.rs/h">How to Live</a> by Derek Sivers that made me contemplate so many times while reading. The moment I was done with the last page, I had my diary out to capture my understanding from each of the 27 answers to that one principal question, <em>how should I live</em>.</p>
<p>As Derek says in the subtitle of the book, they are all conflicting answers. But the conclusion is not weird at all — for one, Derek is a masterful and a deep thinker. Each short chapter has most knowledge presented in the least number of words possible. Wisdom to words ratio is pretty high with this gem of a book.</p>
<p>At the surface, the book is pretty straightforward to read. Short chapters. Short, easy sentences. But, dig deep, and it is one of the most difficult books to fathom. It will force you to question what you have believed throughout your life, and it’s that questioning that will leave your mind unclouded.</p>
<p>It’s easy to write long, elaborate prose. But it takes time to shorten it, and I am glad Derek took that time. In his words, it took him four years, often writing 16 hours a day, to condense it down from the first draft of 1300 pages to 115.</p>
<p>What results is one of the most powerful and important books ever written. Take time and read it slowly. ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p>

			 <p>I enjoy writing posts in Drummer. One of the <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com/2021/10/21/163615.html?title=BenefitsofWritingwithDrummer">many reasons</a> for that is I can see all my posts in the same editing space. It is so easy to scroll through all your posts and find reference to just that one old post.</p>
<p>One thing that missing, though, was there was no easy way to get the <code>url</code> for that post right in Drummer. So, I got scripting. I have <a href="https://gist.github.com/am1t/c1a1d37af7cd33aedc9e1263888a70e0">created a script</a> which does just that. Select any node, run the script, and it will present the URL for that post in a dialog box. Here’s how you enable it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy the below Drummer script and paste it in your special <code>opml</code> file for <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml">Scripts menu</a> (File ⇾ Special files ⇾ Scripts menu…)</li>
<li>You will see a new entry in Scripts menu</li>
<li>Select any node, even the headline (a titled post), and select the newly added script menu item</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get the URL for the selected node.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I recently <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2021/10/12/of-course-i.html">started blogging with Drummer</a>, a new Outliner made public by Dave Winer. It has been a wonderful experience. I don’t know what it is about a single outline as a base for your blog, but it feels natural. I have been enjoying writing and playing around with <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com">my Drummer blog</a>. However, it is not easy to fathom the simplicity of the whole system just through words — only trying it out will make you appreciate the ease. I wanted to capture what it is and how to quickly get started with it for myself and others to follow.</p>
<p>Drummer documentation captures most of this information. But for someone, like me, who’s new to the concept of outliner, the whole stuff can be pretty overwhelming. So, here I capture what I learned and liked so that it helps other newbies like me.</p>
<h2 id="whats-an-outliner">What’s an Outliner?</h2>
<p>An outliner is basically an editor that can edit an outline. What is an outline, you ask? Well, outline is text items represented in a hierarchy, with each item having a parent (typically a title) or multiple sub-items (typically related points). There’s a lot more to know, but I am more focused on drawing a parallel with regular blogging terminologies.</p>
<p>You can think of a first parent item as a title of your post. Each sub-item that follows is like a new paragraph. You can further divide the items into sub-items, that’s grouping related points into a subtitle for example. The only difference is instead of it being represented as a header and list of paragraphs, it is a tree-structure of points, closely related and unrelated.</p>
<p>If a post doesn’t have any child, it’s a titleless post, a micro-post — something like a tweet.</p>
<p>Dave Winer is the strongest proponent of using the outlines as the base for the blogs, he uses them for his blog, <a href="http://scripting.com">Scripting News</a>. The basic hierarchical structure of an outline, makes using outliner for blogging powerful. Both the types of posts, long-form and micro, sit well together. After all, it’s just one long list of text items one after another. Whether they have a sub-item or not define how they get represented. Or that’s how Dave likes them represented.</p>
<p>Drummer is one such outliner that benefits from the years of Dave’s experience. He has understood all the nitty-gritty of blogging through this form. So, once you overcome the initial struggle of unknown, the experience is pretty smooth.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-a-blogging-cms">Is it a Blogging CMS?</h2>
<p>Not really, Drummer is just a web application that can edit outlines. These outlines are typically represented as an <code>OPML</code> file. Basically, all you do with Drummer is edit <code>OPML</code> files of different forms. It wraps a few special <code>OPML</code> files — mainly <code>blog.opml</code> — to give them specific meaning while using them as base for blogging.</p>
<p>But, all we do is edit these <code>OPML</code> files then, what builds the blog?</p>
<p>Well, the software that runs Dave’s blog does that job. It is called <a href="https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog">Old School</a> (because Dave believes this is the old school way of blogging) and is hosted by Dave. In a way, Old School is the blogging CMS and not Drummer.</p>
<p>So, from my understanding, the way the thing connect is as below.</p>
<ol>
<li>You sign in with your Twitter account and that creates the necessary backend — basically a S3 store for your OPML files — based on your Twitter username.</li>
<li>You create, view, edit the <code>OPML</code> files using Drummer. The special files like <code>blog.opml</code> and <code>about.opml</code> hold special meaning for Old School. (<strong>Update:</strong> In fact, <code>about.opml</code> is just used for representation. You can name it anything.) So, you update them and through a command in Drummer (Build my blog), you communicate to Old School server to refresh your blog.</li>
<li>Old School receives the communication and based on provided inputs, it identifies the files to use for building the blog. It reads the <code>OPML</code> files from the backend store for the files and converts them to static files that get served as your blog.</li>
<li>Old School also serves you blog at the <code>http://oldschool.scripting.com/&lt;your-user-name&gt;</code> URL. So in a way, you don’t need to host any additional software.</li>
</ol>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="how-do-i-get-started">How do I get started?</h2>
<p>Dave has a got a handy documentation in place that you can follow. I will point to the relevant parts in the documentation so that you can follow along and get started.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Main blog:</strong> Follow the <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628692121000">getting started guide</a> to get a blog up and running with Drummer. In short, create a <code>blog.opml</code> outline file. Make the outline public. And finally, build the blog using <code>Tools &gt; Build my blog...</code>. This should open a new tab with your blog rendered with Old School. You can customise your title and description of your blog and a few head-level attributes.</li>
<li><strong>Title and Description:</strong> Modify/add the head-level attributes <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> and rebuild your blog.</li>
<li><strong>Header Image:</strong> Add a head-level attribute <code>urlHeaderImage</code> pointing to the header image of your choice and rebuild your blog.</li>
<li><strong>Copyright:</strong> Add a head-level attribute <code>copyright</code> with the text you want to appear in the footer and rebuild your blog.</li>
<li><strong>About Page:</strong> If you want to create a new tab in your blog for <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1633177951000">your About page</a>, create a new <code>about.opml</code> outline file using Drummer, make the outline public, add a head-level attribute <code>urlAboutOpml</code> pointing to this public outline and build your blog again. (<strong>Update:</strong> In fact, <code>about.opml</code> is just used for representation. You can name it anything, as long as you configure the value for <code>urlAboutOpml</code> accordingly.)</li>
<li><strong>Link Blog:</strong> If the concept of linkblog excites you, you <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1633177803000">can use another software</a> by Dave, <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a>. Just add a new head-level attribute <code>urlLinkblogJson</code> pointing to your linkblog JSON file, which would look something like <code>http://radio3.io/users/&lt;your-user-name&gt;/linkblog.json</code>.</li>
<li><strong>TimeZone:</strong> To make sure the dates are rendered correctly on your blog, add a head-level attribute <code>timeZoneOffset</code> for the place where you would be blogging from. The value should be the offset from UTC — for example, <code>+5:30</code> for India or <code>-4</code> for New York.</li>
<li><strong>Creating Post:</strong> Head over to your <code>blog.opml</code> file in Drummer and click on the <strong>+</strong> icon (for New Note), write what you want to write and rebuild your blog. Your post should be up.</li>
<li><strong>Adding Links:</strong> Select the text to which you want to add a link, click on the “Link” icon (the second icon from top in the icon bar that sits on the left of the editing area) and insert the URL.</li>
<li><strong>Adding Images:</strong> This one’s slightly tricky. First, have your image hosted on some place where it would be accessible publicly. Get the URL to your image. While on the item you want to associate the image with, click on the “Edit attributes” icon (the third icon from top in the icon bar that sits on the left of the editing area). Now you can either create an inline image (with attribute <code>inlineImage</code>), right-margin image (with attribute <code>image</code>), title image (with attribute <code>metaImage</code>). I wish this work was simpler.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, you should have a well-configured blog up and running. Keep Drummer interface open in tab and keep adding entries. This method of updating your blog will soon grow on you.</p>
<h2 id="what-else-can-i-customise">What else can I customise?</h2>
<p>Even though you have all the basics covered till now, there is still a lot that you can and should do. But I would recommend get comfortable working Drummer and check for yourself if the workflow fits your routine and liking. If it doesn’t, these additional configurations are just a distraction.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you find out that you are enjoying this system of blogging, here are links to a few additional configurations that you can perform.</p>
<ul>
<li>Customise the styling using the custom templates <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628776805000">1</a>, <a href="http://ol.amitgawande.com/2021/10/13/170912.html?title=customTemplateWithDrummer">2</a></li>
<li>Build your blog <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628861390000">with one-click</a> using dedicated icon</li>
<li>Using Custom Domain for your blog. <a href="%20%20https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/#Using%20a%20custom%20domain%20with%20Drummer">PagePark</a>, <a href="https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/#Using%20a%20custom%20domain%20with%20Drummer">NGINX</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1629212543000">Create a Glossary</a> — a text replacement/substitution/expansion list</li>
<li><a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628781021000">Embed Tweet</a>. <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628781065000">Embed YouTube video</a>. <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628781273000">Emoji Short Codes</a>.</li>
<li>Enabling <a href="http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2021/10/15/203642.html?title=https">HTTPS for Drummer Blog</a> (evolving)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-few-additional-notes">A Few Additional Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li>There’s a Mac app (electron based) called <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml">Electric Drummer</a> that can act as an outliner. However, you should avoid using it for blogging if you intend to blog from multiple systems. Changes made through the app can overwrite ones as done on the web Drummer. So thread carefully.</li>
<li>Drummer is evolving. Dave is working hard to make sure all serious reported issues are resolved. Early adopters are trying out a hundred things independently. If that sounds fun, the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues">Drummer support issues page</a> is the place to go.</li>
<li>You can stay-to-date with all things Drummer by following <a href="http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/">this official blog</a>.</li>
<li>How does Drummer cost zero? <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/12.html#a114128">Dave answers</a>.</li>
<li>Why is Drummer, and other software from Dave, so tightly coupled with Twitter? <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/13/140500.html?title=whyWeUseTwitterIdentity">Dave answers</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>—</p>
<p>I intend to use Drummer as a place where I form my thoughts over the time. The ease of the updating process makes posting unformed thoughts a breeze. So, in a way, this space represents the most raw me. You can follow this me as he experiments with <a href="https://ol.amitgawande.com">my Drummer blog</a>. And of course, there’s an <a href="http://ol.amitgawande.com/rss.xml">RSS feed</a>.</p>

			 <p>I spent a wonderful evening with close friends yesterday whom I met after a long period, some after more than 10 years. It’s remarkable how time can’t slacken some threads, lost possibly in the dull grinds of the life. You pick these threads from where you left them. As you remember the memories of yesteryears, you can laugh at them — or be affected by the updates from people that are not around you at this moment.</p>
<p>You know your bond with a few folks is strong when they can lend the present moment innate warmth. You feel a deep kinship, regardless of how much time has passed since you last met them. Yesterday evening was one such occasion, when we tickled many old memories and made a few new ones.</p>

			 <p>Why’s the colour of everything marked unisex so bland? Who decided that mens don’t like any colours other than black or grey or silver? Or who decided that women will only like pink or purple? Why can’t I go on to a street carrying any non-black coloured umbrella and not get stares that judge me?</p>
<p>Some might say it’s trivial, yet I find this behaviour extremely frustrating. We claim we are making progress on multiple levels, yet we continue to stick our age-old presumptions of choices among sexes. And you know what, I have a theory why the choices of colours specifically are advertised in a way they are.</p>
<p>Professional places are bland — colours aren’t professional. Life and playfulness is colourful. So, who do we see as a professional? Well, of course, men. And who’s all about play? Right? <em>Right?</em></p>
<p>Do you want to test this hypothesis? Here are Google Image searches for “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=man+with+umbrella">man with umbrella</a>” — how many blacks do you see there? Now, here’s the results' page for “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=woman+with+umbrella">woman with umbrella</a>”. Same question, how many blacks do you see there? Plus, what other commonality do you see among the images that are on the page? What’s the look that men are flaunting? And what about women? The industry is infuriating. Sigh!</p>

			 <p>I have heard many good things about Derek Siver’s new book “<a href="https://sive.rs/h">How To Live</a>” from a few people I trust. So, it was instinctive of me to purchase the book the moment I saw Derek announce it is launched. I had missed purchasing this when Derek shared a preview link — no idea why.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am excited to read this, both as a reader and as a writer.</p>

			 <p>Why’s there a fascination among the devs to <em>reinvent</em> the old tech that isn’t broken? Maybe the reason that the tech has stayed the same isn’t because no one attempted to change it. Can you fathom the possibility that the tech might be fine, as it is, to most common folks? Or perhaps it might not be one of those things that most give a hoot about? Yeah?</p>
<p>The two prime examples I see many developers take a go at are browsers and email. Please, both work fine as they are. Don’t try to reinvent them. They have reached a state in which they are open and standard enough already. Most people know the functionality they can expect while using it.</p>
<p>Stop reinventing it. Improve it, no doubt. Make it faster, simpler. Cleaner. But don’t <em>change</em> the definition of what that tech represents. Don’t mar the traits that make the tech great in the first place, universal accessibility.</p>
<p>Don’t attach a lot of muck around the fundamentals of the accepted tech and call it “2.0”. I will suggest call it “1.0” of whatever the heck you want to name it.</p>

			 <p>Kids are free, untouched by the necessities of the life. The concept of “necessary” doesn’t register itself with them.</p>
<p>For a kid, everything is necessary and, at the same time, nothing is. Is it necessary to eat? Sure, if he is hungry. Otherwise, it isn’t.</p>
<p>A kid does nothing because <em>it</em> is necessary to do it. He does it because <em>he</em> wants to do it.</p>
<p>In that sense, a kid always emphasises inwards, focuses on what is important to himself. As we grow, we forgot what matters. We emphasise what’s external.</p>
<p>The societal pressures. The fear of missing out. A kid knows none. <em>I like this</em> is all he cares about.</p>
<p>Listen to the kid in you, he sits closest to your heart. And if you can’t hear him, life’s going to a difficult journey, my friend. Be quick and wake up that kid within you.</p>

<p>I am certain it isn&rsquo;t for dummies neither does it claims to be so anywhere. It is for folks in a hurry, sure. I can&rsquo;t remember the last non-fiction book that read so easy for me. This feat is even more praiseworthy, given Neil deGrasse Tyson attempts to touch upon some of the most complicated and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->buzz-wordy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> topics from the past 13 billion of existence of this universe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them. In other words, after the laws of physics, everything else is opinion,&rdquo; says Tyson. I have rarely heard someone be so calm, yet extremely badass at the same time.</p>

<p>Seth Godin <a href="https://seths.blog/2021/08/the-inevitable-decline-of-fully-open-platforms/">talking about</a> how open platforms are always in risk of becoming spammy and losing the trust of the users. I entirely agree — it’s a path that most platforms, open and closed, follow.</p>
<p>They enjoy the carefree attention from the excited early adopters who associate with the core values of the platform creators. But as the platform grows, it attracts users which would neither share the excitement nor the patience of the early adopters. They get noisy — they want to use the platform like their old one they are comfortable with. They <em>need</em> features that they are used to, not what the platform provides.</p>
<p>So, eventually, the tension that Seth refers to above gains prominence.</p>

I had <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2017/09/01/160500.html">published another in 2017</a>. Both the posts talk about a similar observation, about the constant fight between the coder and a writer in me. It reads in such a similar manner. The choice of words, the structure, the flow. It should be pretty apparent to anyone who reads it that both the posts come from the mind. From the same author.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, when I wrote the recent post, I had no clue that I had written about the same topic earlier some time. In a way, then, the adage that “there’s no original work being written, but just rewrites” is not that far off.</p>

<p>Google, well, decides to live in a fantasy world where there can exist no perfect messaging app. They get close to finding that right solution and throw it all away.</p>
<p>I had hopes from Microsoft. But for some reason they seem not to be interested in consumer space. Skype is ugly, its too bloated and the experience is terrible. It is not easy for families to join from.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, amidst all the mess, remains the only solution that does the required to any extend. It’s a terrible experience, but at least it works.</p>

<p>That app has a special place in my mind. Just like Google Reader.</p>

			 <p>I came across <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/donelist">this suggestion from Oliver Burkeman</a> a few time in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if you worked on the basis that you began each day at zero balance, so that everything you accomplished – every task you got done, every tiny thing you did to address the world&rsquo;s troubles, or the needs of your household – put you ever further into the black?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, the idea is to keep a done list rather than a to-do list. I am absolutely certain that it benefits one&rsquo;s morale. I know that because I have been maintaining a form of done list &ndash; just that my method is different. For me, the two lists are complementary. I use a to-do list as a way to free my mind of the burden to remember things I need to do.</p>
<p>I do not set a target, an end date, for any of the tasks on the to-do list. So, they are not burdensome to me as my day begins. I look at the list, prioritize and just plan it through the day, if possible. A bullet journal helps me here - and also acts as a done-list. More the crosses on a page, more is the satisfaction.</p>

<p>I finished reading  <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781400064281">Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die</a> by Chip Heath. I wanted to love this book - the premise is brilliant. But it reads like a textbook, and that&rsquo;s no way to make a message stick with your readers. For that matter, that doesn&rsquo;t even look to be the author&rsquo;s intention.</p>
<p>To start with, the book lacks a clear, central idea that every chapter circles back to - it&rsquo;s all over the place. It digs into the history to find and describe every event, research or anecdote where a difficult message was conveyed effectively. Once it does that, the author summaries his understanding of why that worked.</p>
<p>First, the author nonchalantly tells you what the learning is &ndash; &ldquo;Which message do you think works best? Of course, second&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m sorry, but let the reader come to that conclusion. Don&rsquo;t beat him on the head till he gives up and agrees in frustration.</p>
<p>Second, each time the reasons that the message was effectively conveyed in each story are too varied &ndash; it references almost every phycological/managerial techniques - Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy and five whys and on &amp; on.</p>
<p>Finally, suggestions like be simple/concrete, don&rsquo;t bury the lead, capture attention etc are easier said that done. They are a set of skill that all understand they should have, but not every person has in equal doses. Please, your suggestion cannot be &ldquo;become a master public speaker or leader or designer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sigh, it was frustrating to read through this book. Ironically, it fails to follow the message it wishes to convey - talk about one message, be simple and concise. It would have stuck with me then. 📚</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These methods of archiving are either imperfect, impractical, or both—and besides, even if I went through with them, chances are that decades from now, I’d just end up with a monster text file or a long-obsolete hard drive that would be a pain to sync up with some future listening platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I lost my music collection some 7 years back and I never attempted to build a personal music library since then. I have accepted the fact that the benefits of streaming services (mainly around discovery) are more valuable to me than my quest for a personal collection of my favorite songs. Unfortunate, but practical.</p>

			 <p>I am wary of using any Apple services as my default - they make it very difficult to use them outside of their ecosystem. I do not use only Apple devices. There was a time when I did. And then things slowly changed.</p>
<p>I use Windows at work. I use Android and iOS. I use iPad. Apple services rarely work well across all the platforms. <em>Just access then on web</em> is not an answer am comfortable with.</p>
<p>So as much as I dislike it, I am slowly using more and more services from Google and Microsoft. Surprisingly, Microsoft does well to fill the void between Android and iOS platforms with apps that work well on both platforms backed by Microsoft services.</p>
<p>I find it crazy that neither Google nor Apple are keen to address this key problem.</p>

			 <p>OnePlus completely messed up my upgrade plans with its product launches this year.</p>
<p>I have been pleased with my OnePlus 7, it has worked brilliantly for the past two years. For that matter, the phone continues to work well for me. It hasn&rsquo;t slowed down. Battery still lasts me throughout the day. I just wish for better cameras now.</p>
<p>I had made my mind that my next phone was going to be the pro variant of next OnePlus. But somehow the company has managed to screw up its most valuable brand.</p>
<p>First, they priced the devices far too high this year. In itself, it&rsquo;s OK if you can match the offerings of the other flagship brands - mainly Apple and Samsung - beyond the device. OnePlus still has some work to do to reach that state.</p>
<p>Then, after unnecessary hype, they launched a product which has been <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/search/query?q=oneplus&amp;wm=false">marred by coverage</a> that they could very well have avoided. They mindlessly under-spec&rsquo;d the non-pro variant of the device. The pro variant is facing the outcome of overpromising and then deliver just on expected lines.</p>
<p>I could still decide to ignore the negative coverage and go ahead with the Pro variant. The reviews haven&rsquo;t been too bad, and I know what I can expect from a OnePlus device now. But I wish the company did not make the decision so difficult for me. I had just started warming up to the Android platform and its benefits.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time">Make Time: How to Focus on What Matters Every Day</a> today. I cannot apply all the suggestions that the authors have to offer. But it&rsquo;s a fascinating list of a few easy to follow tactics, presented in a no-nonsense manner. The authors stay to the point; they don&rsquo;t ramble along as many authors of the self-help books tend to do.</p>
<p>I did find a few of the suggestions pretty useful and have already incorporated a couple. I can clearly see the benefit. What helped is that the authors worked in an industry and in roles that I can closely associate with. So, I could relate to many of the problems they talked about and was keen to hear what changes worked for them.</p>
<p>If you are at a full-time job and are struggling to get the right balance between work and life, this book would have a few strategies that you might find useful. 📚</p>

			 <p>I have been reading many books from Christie recently. Every time I get into a reading lull, I pick up a Poirot mystery and start reading. I was facing one such lull and Dame Agatha was to the rescue again. Her books always help me get back to reading more.</p>
<p>Anyway, after I read another of her wonderfully crafted mysteries &ndash; <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215492.Lord_Edgware_Dies">Lord Edgware Dies</a> &ndash; I wondered why are these books not generally adapted to TV series and films. Most of her books are perfect. Yet, we hardly see any adaptations. Is it due to licensing?</p>
<p>Anyway, the one attempt I had seen recently was the disappointing <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/murder_on_the_orient_express_2017">Murder on the Orient Express</a> from 2017. It was unnecessarily stylized, the adaptations need to let the story take over. The complex simplicity is the most important virtue of the Christie&rsquo;s stories. Then there is the old, yet long-running, TV series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094525/">Poirot</a> &ndash; again, enjoyable in parts but tries too hard. That said, I have liked whatever I have managed to see (mostly on YouTube).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much scope for something in the middle, not too stylized and yet, a modern adaptation. Preferably in the form of a film or a TV mini-series. I did come across one such adaptation, the 2015 three episode television <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Then_There_Were_None_(TV_series)">mini-series of And Then There Were None</a>. IMDB Plus has made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nh56fQe-zk">all the episodes available on YouTube</a>. I enjoyed this particular form. I felt it worked.</p>
<p>So sad that there isn&rsquo;t much readily available.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so frustrating to see the state hardly change. A call to <em>tell the makers of the service why you cannot use their service</em> is rarely answered. Sure, new social networks are launched, but they have the same underlying problems. They create unnecessary flutter and eventually die down. Why not create buzz for something that&rsquo;s not aiming simply for the acquisition?</p>

			 <p>My daughter has been reading short storybooks since she was 5. She likes to read &ndash; she would find a comfortable corner for herself and start reading her books. I was a bit cautious introducing her to a full-length novel, though. I didn&rsquo;t want to dampen her interest in reading by the usual wordiness of the novels.</p>
<p>But recently, she asked me for some big books &ndash; &ldquo;I am bored with these small stories,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<em>I know them by heart now.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, I did give her a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27558257-magic-of-the-lost-temple">couple of</a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6310.Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory">&ldquo;big&rdquo; books</a> last week, and she hardly goes anywhere without her book since then. She carries a pencil and an eraser, underlines words she doesn&rsquo;t understand well, bookmarks pages. Ah, I&rsquo;m so happy to see her so engrossed while reading. I wish I had started reading sooner; I&rsquo;m delighted to see my daughter has.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Oh, recently I have seen another habit of hers. She likes to copy small stories into her notebook, then read them in her handwriting and out loud in her voice. Yay!</p>
<p>I wish she keeps her interest in reading intact as she grows and would assist her in whichever way possible. To start with though, I need to choose the right books.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16366.Endless_Night">Endless Night by Agatha Christie</a> and am not at all impressed. This review might contain spoilers, but I can&rsquo;t help I have to rant.</p>
<p>Nah, I am not letting the ending influence the overall rating for the book again. It is easy to get wowed by the intelligent ending and rate this book highly. But it wasn&rsquo;t a good read for me.</p>
<p>Right from the start, I didn&rsquo;t trust the narrator. I guess I&rsquo;ve been fooled by many first-person narrations for my liking. Michael is a poor narrator - not sure if it was intentional on Christie&rsquo;s part. None of his actions, his reactions made sense to me, further heightening my suspicions about what I was being told by him. So the twist towards the end fell flat - it was as if I already knew deep down and was just waiting for it to be revealed.</p>
<p>Oh, and I was waiting a lot of time throughout the book. 2/3rds in and there is hardly anything that takes place. To me, the love story between Mike and Ellie was not interesting. The way it played out was dull. It got tiring at one point to read Mike <em>tell</em> what was happening. The suspense around Gipsy&rsquo;s Acre wasn&rsquo;t built at all. It was supposed to be a &ldquo;gothic story with gypsy&rsquo;s warnings&rdquo; - wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>This may have been a brilliant psychological thriller for its time. But a lot has happened since 1967 and too many have been inspired by the style of surpriseful narration from this mystery master for this style to create the necessary impression anymore. This read was so unlike any other from Agatha Christie and this time it is not in positive sense.</p>

			 <p>I have a pretty common first name (or given name as it is called at some places). It&rsquo;s so common that even the movie characters with my name have rarely had any significant part to play.

But I was wrong with my assumption &ndash; boy there are so many Amit Gawande&rsquo;s out there on Facebook, the &ldquo;universal phonebook&rdquo;. <em>Yo namesake morons, why are you still using that app?</em></p>
<p>The names from European countries always fascinate me <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Every name sounds so unique. And has such a complex tone to it &ndash; it&rsquo;s new every time I hear it. And if I think I&rsquo;ve already heard it, they adorn the spelling with an extra &ldquo;z&rdquo;. Fantastic!</p>
<p>Having a common first name sucks. Having it end with an equally common surname sucks more. Good luck getting high up the search results list <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. I dread creating my account on any new service that is launched. I rarely get a username with just my first name &ndash; there is already a developer building that bloody service. With surname? Nah. With the first letter of surname? Nah. With a number or underscore in there? Yep, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that&rsquo;s what<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you get<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>That also the reason why I respect <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the service<!-- raw HTML omitted --> where I could get that username with just my first name. Uhm!</p>
<p>Of course, if your aim in life is just to get lost in the crowd, be not know or just be, have a common name. But who wants that? <em>Right? RIGHT?</em></p>

<p>This one had a pretty interesting storyline with lots of twists and red herring peppered across the chapters. Having said that, I wish the writing in the middle third was a lot more crisp. It gets too simplistic, slips into a narrative style of <em>telling</em> what&rsquo;s playing out. I would have lost the patience, but it was the rapid pacing of the plot that kept me going. Also it has a few subplots and characters that should have been edited out - it becomes tiresome to follow towards the end.</p>
<p>With all said, this is a promising debut nonetheless by Raman with a welcome, quick read with an Indian setting.</p>

			 <p>I was fascinated to learn about the so called town under one roof - Whittier. It has to be one of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/heres-what-its-like-to-visit-whittier-alaska-the-town-under-one-roof/slidelist/51542206.cms">the most isolated places</a> <em>which people call home</em>. I have so many questions about how the residents of this town <em>make</em> this place a home, how the isolation, the sameness affects them. It mustn&rsquo;t be easy.</p>
<p>I was mesmerized by this how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLnEHiIMohM">Michael Stevens describes</a> what the town must represent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The earth around Whittier is not always a friendly place. But so long as people call it home, Whittier stands as a magnificent gesture of defiance. Of human engineering. And the strength of inertia, of our desire to stay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more I think about it, maybe the life of us city dwellers is no less isolated than the residents of Whittier. Sure, they are stuck in one same building, surrounded on all sides by rocks. But so are we - if not physically, mentally we have caged ourselves.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve got a few minor (?) feature requests for Micro.blog hosting based on my limited experience with the service. I think these features will further heighten and simplify the experience.</p>
<ol>
<li>I wish the edit buttons were available on the posts in the timeline, for example, right next to the remove option.  The availability of the remove option makes me believe the context is already available. Also, I understand an option to edit the original posts from blogs not hosted by Micro.blog might be tricky, but I hope Manton finds some simple solution, as he usually does.</li>
<li>I believe the edit for the replies is far simpler in comparison and should really avoid all the hoops one has to go through today, just for minor fixes.</li>
<li>Just the way, the whole site can be archived to GitHub automatically, I wish the custom theme can be too. It would help to track all the changes being made to the site design. Without the option, I need to manually set up and check-in the changes to the repository. And given how easy it is to update the custom theme from the browser, it just feels natural to allow backing up the theme as a git repository.</li>
<li>Currently, the spell checks and Grammarly plugin does not work in the post drafting <code>textarea</code>. I am not yet sure why, but it makes the posts very prone to errors.</li>
<li>This is way down the list (literally), but I wish the drafts are auto-saved while composing longer posts. I do not want to lose a draft just because I closed a window by mistake.</li>
</ol>
<p>Possibly these items are already on Manton&rsquo;s backlog list but just aren&rsquo;t prioritized. In which case, here&rsquo;s an added vote for these features.</p>

			 <p>With the way IPL has played out this year, I&rsquo;m sure the mood in many teams room is a tad dreary. Many performances picked up late causing reshuffle of the points table towards the later half. Though only Mumbai Indians have been consistent, I hope we get a new champion.</p>

			 <p>I came across this <a href="https://www.baty.net/2017/wordpress-is-a-typewriter/">opinion from Jack Baty</a> about static sites and I completely agree with him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[P]ublishing a static site is like sending a document to a printer. I have to make sure everything is connected, that there’s paper in the machine, and then wait for the job to finish before seeing the output. If something needs editing, and something always needs editing, the whole process starts over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a time when I enjoyed building my site with Hugo, but I never got comfortable with the writing flow then. Once I got tired and moved away, I&rsquo;d made up my mind that I won&rsquo;t ever sign up for a static site for my blog again. I firmly believe that blogs aren&rsquo;t the right candidates for static site generators.</p>
<p>Blogging platforms need to be light, free - something that static site generators, with the way they are setup, can never be. Jack&rsquo;s got just the right metaphor to express my thoughts. Writing <em>does</em> feel like priting a document with static sites.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I really enjoyed Aaron Sorkin&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_trial_of_the_chicago_7">The Trial of the Chicago 7</a> - it was an absorbing account of an event I didn&rsquo;t have much information about. I usually like the well-made courtroom dramas and this one was no different. And I also usually <em>love</em> Sorkin&rsquo;s method of telling stories and, again, this one was no different.</p>
<p>Though debatable, Sorkin is a master of narrating true stories, keeping you glued to the screen as he unravels more details about the story. He has also mastered his signature style to blend varying and often opposing, narratives and perspectives without letting the drama drag any moment. Even though I didn&rsquo;t know much about the event, I was completely involved and moved at many moments.</p>
<p>Also, as I was watching the trial play out, I thought Sorkin must have taken a lot of liberty in presenting the facts &ndash; especially the actions of Judge Hoffman. <em>No human can be such an asshole</em>, I thought. So the first thing I did was to check how closely were the event and the trial presented. I was surprised to find that most of <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2020/10/trial-chicago-seven-aaron-sorkin-accuracy-netflix.html">the key moments shown were true</a> &ndash; even the judge&rsquo;s behaviour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As unbelievable as it seems, Judge Hoffman, born in 1895, really did act with the malice shown in the film, dismissing objections from the defense before they were made and arbitrarily excluding evidence, witnesses, and even jurors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Horrible!</p>

			 <p>Another introduction where I am involved, as in I listen, happened today. These introductions haunt me, always. Names are exchanged and so is the purpose for visit and some pleasantries. We talk, we laugh, we share. Then the meeting, or the visit, ends. Everything is well and good. That is until we meet the next time. The other person smiles, starts talking. And all I am thinking, of course with a smile on my face, is what the bloody hell is your name again!? As it turns out, the last time we met, it was the name part that I conveniently side-stepped while registering the introduction in memory.</p>
<p>And this occurs with me way too often. Initial interaction happens with the introduction, then I forget the name. At first I just don&rsquo;t take the trouble to know the name thinking may be we just won&rsquo;t meet that often after all.  But the interaction continues. It increases often; we meet more. We talk more. We become acquaintances. We are on the verge of becoming friends. And all I am still thinking of is how the hell should I get this person mouth his name again. Asking for name is absolutely not an option now because I am already in a friend or a known person zone. The bridge has been crossed. So all I do is wait for him or some one else speak the said person&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>And I do realize this is a very assholistic behavior on my part. So this time I decide this behavior of mine has to end. And I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->query the web<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You know what, this is way too common a phenomenon. So common that there are zillions of &ldquo;n ways to remember names&rdquo; self-helf articles across the web. Ways suggested stretch from plain childish to utter foolish.</p>
<p>For example, break the name into parts and remember the parts. Yeah.. a fool-proof way. Only if I could remember to break the name first and remember the parts next. Or associate the name with something. So if you are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ramesh<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I will remember you as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mesh<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. What bull crap. How awkward would it be to think of the made association every time you meet, say <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Vikas or Hardik.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Nope. Not gonna work. Or make the name dance in front of eyes. Or what not. Complete non-sense.</p>
<p>Only thing that made sense to me was to speak the name out aloud. More times, the better. Well that is one thing I can do. That is one thing I am going to do rather. So next time you meet me and introduce yourself, please bear with me if I go on chanting your name in every statement that follows. And so will I if I see you doing the same.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Inferno<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dan Brown<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Going in to the chapter 1 of Inferno, I didn&rsquo;t have too high expectations. I was looking for a breezy page-turner with some anecdotes on sculptures, people, places intermingled with the story. However I was disappointed to see Dan Brown fail to deliver even that.</p>
<p>Anecdotes are way too many and completely irrelevant to the story. Many a times, the novel reads as Brown&rsquo;s travelogue of places during his research, just there to increase the page count. I remember ignoring many paragraphs describing some sculpture or a building or a painting. Uninteresting. Plain boring. Do research Mr. Brown; just don&rsquo;t force everything into a novel.</p>
<p>And there are so many discernible and ludicrous attempts at being relevant to the current tech-aware audience. All the references to iPads, iPhones, ebooks etc. fall flat, cringeworthy.</p>
<p>Finally to the story, what is expected is a mystery to be solved by Professor Langdon through the clues sprinkled in historic symbols. I feel the novel fails there too. Codes and clues are way too simple, straight-forward. Many don&rsquo;t even lead something significant; they are just there to bring Langdon in picture. Inferno could well have been a sci-fi mystery novel instead of a Robert Langdon one. Disappointed.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kane and Abel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jeffrey Archer<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>My rating: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4 of 5 stars<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>First two chapters down and I knew am in for an epic saga. The book had me right from the stories of the two protagonists being christened.</p>
<p>This was one of the finest examples of how the characters are built. Every single one, even the supporting ones, was well shaped. With that done in the backdrop of the historical events, they felt real. To see how each one of the events impacted the characters had a smile on my face. I was emotionally with them in their rise to success, rooting for one at times, while the other at others. Their stories might feel cliched, but I felt them. And then they met, right around the middle.</p>
<p>I felt the second half was a bit weak. The events became forced every time the characters had to meet. Kane and Abel, as individuals, had me intrigued. But Kane and Abel together? Not much. The rivalry felt contrived, childish. Agreed, I was interested to know what unfolded next. But it played out just the way I predicted. Interested, and then disappointed not to be proved wrong.</p>
<p>And I have to mention that the romantic parts were the weakest. Such lifeless, boring mentions of jumbled adult words. There for just no reason. Good they didn&rsquo;t last long, I cringed every time.</p>
<p>Having said all, I did enjoy the novel, an entertaining read. It had me interested in Kane and Abel till the end. And that&rsquo;s where it succeeded.</p>

<p>Puzzled, the airport executives undertook a more careful, on-site analysis. They found that it took passengers a minute to walk from their arrival gates to baggage claim and seven more minutes to get their bags. Roughly 88 percent of their time, in other words, was spent standing around waiting for their bags.</p>
<p>So the airport decided on a new approach: instead of reducing wait times, it moved the arrival gates away from the main terminal and routed bags to the outermost carousel. Passengers now had to walk six times longer to get their bags. Complaints dropped to near zero.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>There is some great theory there. Man I love human tendency to fool oneself into not hating something.</p>

<p>There Google scientists created one of the largest neural networks for machine learning by connecting 16,000 computer processors, which they turned loose on the Internet to learn on its own.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Credit where it is due, Google has to be lauded for encouraging the open research on topics so varied. There is so much potential with computing power and data at Google.</p>
<p>At cost of being cynical (a bit), I felt this would be so so useful (?) to Google with all the data that it has with it. And equally frightening to the users watching. Obviously Google is looking at that, no? And then I read this.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And bingo!</p>
<p>On a side note, NYT had to ruin it by changing the headline to “How many computers to identify a cat? 16000”. Underplays the success that this is.</p>

			 <p>… I won’t be surprised if BJP tags this loss as the failure of UPA government. Someone, mostly Gadkari, might go so far to claim that there is a big conspiracy behind the loss. UPA planned and executed the loss just to divert “aam aadmi’s” attention away from the zillions of unearthing scams.</p>
<p>UPA on the other hand will appoint a committee to look into the loss and give out the steps to be followed, “Committee will come up with the report which will go to PAC that will come to parliament where it will be discussed over and, if any irregularities found, will be open for discussion on action to be taken, followed by the actual action to be taken, given it is decided that another committee need not be formed to investigate the report submitted by the first committee.”</p>
<p>Diggy Singh would suddenly wake up and blurt out “Right-wing Hindu organisation RSS has to be behind this. I have evidence and can prove if I am asked to.” No one will ask him to stop spreading his bloody verbal  dysentery and he will happily go back to sleep.</p>
<p>Manish Tiwari, if asked for comment or if isn’t either, will go on and on with his heavy words artillery and pose another hundred questions at the end of which the initial question will remain unanswered.</p>
<p>Well cricket fans will burn few effigies and wait for the next tour/series/gully challenge trophy where India will play again as favorites.</p>
<p>BCCI will plan another tour (2 tests, 3 ODIs, 2 T20s) against Zimbabwe accepting their offer to pay the money won through win against Bangladesh in return.</p>
<p>New breed cricketers will continue their wait for IPL and play the international matches as practice sessions for IPL.</p>

			 <p>Another day, when things did not go as planned. Things worked out well, almost, but did not go to plan. Nothing happened as I thought it should, but I did not complain because it did not affect me negatively. I consoled my mind “all is well”.</p>
<p>Though it did not end the way it should have. I knew something needs to change. And the change is brought. Vague, but truth. Isn’t that how the truth is most often?</p>

			 <p>Change is important. Change is inevitable. But if not, it has to be forced. Change is one thing I plan to undergo every time there is nothing happening around.</p>
<p>Change the way I commute to office. Change the route I use. Change the time I travel. Change the schedule at office. Change the schedule at home. Change the services I use. Change the products I use. I.e. Change everything that’s changeable.</p>
<p>Change something. Change at least one thing. Because that cascades down one’s life to change everything. And this change is important. It freshens one up. It pushes one out of his comfort zone. Rather it just doesn’t allow him to enter a comfort zone; a zone of mechanical activeness.</p>

			 <p>It was second incident in last 2 weeks when I had to select a mobile number for myself. Now this activity may sound simple and non-important. But I always find it an extremely confusing experience.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Think about it. In front of you are the numbers “available” for you to select as your contact number. Now first thing you have to make sure is the number should be at least easy enough to remember yourself so you do not have to open your contact list every time someone asks for your number.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now I always find one which is easy enough to remember myself. But it so happens that the way I say the number is always different from how the person who listens to it utters.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To elaborate, I speak the number this way 4 2345 85 15. (Spaces are the pauses I take.) So simple right. Now this is how the other person repeats it 423 458 515. I am like what the hell. It takes me few seconds to realise both of them are the same.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So the aim is to, if possible, select a number which is easy to remember/recognise, whatever way one utters it. And I very rarely find one.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That’s not all. Lets move back to the initial situation. As I said, in front of you are the numbers “available” for you to select. Available. For you. Only these numbers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So basically these are the numbers which no one, who has selected his contact number earlier, found easy enough to remember. And I have to select one from them. I could, till date, never prevent this thought from entering my mind.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the end, I always end up selecting some number which neither I, nor someone else could fathom at the same time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>PS: Just received a compliment of my number being awesomely simple. So mission accomplished the second time.</p>

			 <p>There is one concept in this confusing world which I absolutely hate. Something called “Timezone”. Who, in their right mind, will decide that from today onwards, we will attach a 3 or 4 letter combination at the end of time and make it a hell of an experience to understand what time it exactly is.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Think about it. How simple would the life have been if the time was same for everyone, 2am is 2am. Irrespective of whether you are in USA or Germany or Australia or India. But no, some smarty pants didn’t like it simple. And in came the senseless words like PST and EST and AEST and IST and what not.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->They did not stop at that. They brought something else called “Daylight Saving Time”. I mean haven’t you made the concept ‘time’ itself enough confusing sucker that now you add another two heavy words before that?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Look at what it does in Australia. Daylight savings is put in place so that afternoons are brightest and mornings are lesser. They move the time further by an hour. So 5pm AEST is now 6pm AEST. I still can’t accept that there was no sensible guy present who crawled at them shouting dudes you are screwing the evenings.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now it does not get dark till 8pm. Yeah bugger 8pm is the time when you can say it is evening. And as a nice middle class Indian kid I am taught to sleep at 10:00pm. So basically I sleep when the evening has just dawned. Screw you Mr. Daylight Saver.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moreover I never understand why the eff was this philosophy put in place at the first place. Not like it is saving hell lot of light or something. Irrespective of this daylight saving, light will remain the same between dawn and dusk. Why add 1 hour rather than simply calling it a day when there is light, not when it is 5am.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now to the outcome of all these twisted minds. Today when some dumbo mentions just some random time, say 2pm, you have to first query is it his time or yours? Lucky you if he is not a dumbo and says yours. But as I have called him a dumbo, he has to say it is his 2pm.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So you have to first think what country he is at. Then think what season/month it is at that place. Then think if it is sunny enough there for introducing daylight savings? Then if it is, find out how many hours you need to add to make sure you know when you need to call him exactly. Thank you, you SOAB.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now don’t be too smart yourself and bring in technologies like google and world clocks and all. Thats not the point.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The point is wouldn’t the world be a little less messy and irritating a place to spend lifetime of yours at, had you not have to worry about as simple a question as “what time is it”?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->PS: I believe there was a reason for bringing all these concepts through. But I also believe there has to be a simpler solution to this worldly problem. I have few thoughts but need to put them in place. Topic for another post soon.</p>

			 <p>Cake was being cut. Everybody stood around the “oh-am-one-more-year-old” guy and all of them were like “cmon-cut-that-cake-now-you-moron”. I stood there hoping that the cursed words do not leave some jackass’ mouth. And they did, against my wish..</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ldquo;Happy B’day to you… happy b’day to you..&lt;blah blah.. blah blah..&gt;&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now 80% percent did hum along the first “Happy B’day to you”. The number, however, dropped exponentially after that. The last “Happy B’day to you” was wished just by a single dumbo. Big time embarrassment I tell you.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>See I am not being cynical here. I am equally happy that this person neared his death by one more year. But the problem is no one sings that song with the feelings it was actually meant to have. Plus the guy for whom the song is being sung is equally embarrassed as those who sing that song. So question arises why sing it at all.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Moreover I always felt whoever sung that song for the first time had something anti-asian boiling in his mind. Why the hell will he compose the third line the way he did then?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Confused? Well you haven’t sung, on top of your voice, “Happy b’day dear Harmoninderpal or Au or Venkataramana” then. I have and let me tell you, it is very effort taking. Need an indication of how effort taking and difficult it is? Well try and make <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nisha Kothari<!-- raw HTML omitted --> act.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So the point am trying to make is stop singing this song. The melody was picked up from some song sung by two kindergarten school teachers in some late 1800’s and it does not suit this age now. Go read details <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Stop being moronic and make all the people involved, cake cutters and cake eaters, embarrassed. Birthday celebrations would be lesser pathetic this way.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>PS: This song singing always reminds of the way we used to hum the “maine pyar tumhise kiya hain..” song during antakshari sessions in front of the girls, which were the ‘things’ we used to interact with just during such sessions back then. Embarrassing, way embarrassing!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>PPS: The key to the “since 1912” part in title is in that link I shared for this moronic song’s history. Go grab a bite.</p>

			 <p>Since I arrived in Sydney, this question has been discussed and fought and betted over so many times among we friends. I mean the moment a clearcut-non-firangi girl is spotted, the next question that pops out is “Is she Indian?”.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The reason is simple. Everyone wants to be on top of his face reading skills. ‘I see them and I identify them’ is what most would want to boast about. No specific take away expected, just a self-satisfaction. And anyone and everyone is ready to bet a coffee or a lunch or a dinner for proving his reign over the so-called skill.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now gone are the days when it was assumed that if someone bets, he must be right. So no one agrees with other, rather he too bets along. Thus these bets always end up being unverified “my-word-to-his” bets.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But that no way reduces the fun in such bets. The theories each side has to defend his view are just innovative, patentable always. Every single aspect, the way she talks, walks, stands, puts on makeup or does hair, is used as basis. You see basics have to be strong every time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However today was different. Another such case was spotted and a bet initiated. This time however both were determined to prove he is right. And decided they will go enquire and sort this out once and for all.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now imagine a situation, when a couple of guys with a bearded attire, resembling a “just-woke-up-hungry-ready-to-pounce” looks, walk to a simple unknown girl and query “Are you Indian?”. Both have the “I-would-win” hope filled looks in their eyes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What can a girl respond in such situation other than a straight “no”. I guess she would negate anything these guys say or ask including “Are you a girl?”. Well that didn’t solve the bet. In came the defence, “The way she said no straight away? She has to be Indian”.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So for me the bet remained unresolved though I commended their courage to carry this attire with such confidence in front of an unknown unidentified girl. The question still remained, “Is she Indian?”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>PS: Girls from china, japan, taiwan, malaysia etc are out of discussion here. I don’t want to sound any way racist, but I will just say we all <!-- raw HTML omitted -->name them under one category<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and move along. They would be having there own internal discussion about their origins the moment they spot one.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>PPS: Such discussions happen even in India when the skill move to a state level, i,e read a face and guess the state.</p>

			 <p>The beasts called elevators end up pissing me off every single time. I had rambled about these dumb asses earlier <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Go grab a bite.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you have read that post, you will know that the ramblings mentioned earlier were particularly about those ill-chipped lifts of that underdeveloped guest house. But now I am convinced these shameless creatures are programmed to torture their inmates.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I mean think about it. What are the decisions these lifeless steel rooms have to make.. (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Inspiration<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>First decision is pretty simple. We make that decision for you, you bugger. You see those glowing numbers on the number pads we keep on pressing one after other? Yeah that is where we want to go. As quick as possible.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Second decision has a whole lot of mechanics behind it. I mean there are some shafts and then there are some holes on some vertical tapes and then there is some counting involved. I would surely like to go in details, but I don’t want to. So I won’t. Visit that inspiration link you see above.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However the part that puzzles me the most is the strategy because that’s when these supposed-to-be angels stop being ones and enter the devil’s land. Now these buggers have to strategise where to go, when to go and how to go. And I absolutely feel that they are not wired to do so. I mean how else can you explain the simplest of the things these dudes screw up.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>How many times have you waited for an elevator to scroll right from 50 meters below basement up to the 14th floor when his other buddy is resting right at the 15th floor? Do they have some gentlemen’s agreement where one simply says “Can’t you see sucker I have just finished carrying 6 fat asses up and down thrice between just 2 floors. I am tired now and you can for sure handle these dumbos”.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>How many times have you jailed yourself in a jam packed elevator as it drools itself down the shaft stopping and opening at each floor. If you are outside, those seemingly endless few seconds you spend when you apply all your permutation skills to see if you can possibly fit in any of the available gaps inside before giving up are just killing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are many other plights of these long travels between floors. But you see the point is the where, when and how part has to be strategised properly.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I will pen down the requirements for you. An elevator, for minimum, has to</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>These are just a few suggestions that can make this floor travel not a sucking experience after all.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>PS: On an unrelated note, why the hell does every single elevator has to have mirrors? Who wrote this unwritten law first? It just gives me one more chance for not letting the elevator know where I want to go and follow a journey to a floor undesired with this lifeless but life sucking beast.</p>

			 <p>Prologue: I have been working on quite a lot of posts recently but could not finish them and bring them to any bloggable format. So finally decided I should repost some old post. Here goes one such post.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yesterday i had quite a random dream. Random indeed it was. For the most part of it i was pretty happy about what i was experiencing. And suddenly i went blank. I would say the dream went blank. Making me befuddled. Completely perplexed. Full of queries, queries for myself to answer. But before i get into the dream itself, let me blabber my views on dreams in general.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dreams are angels. Yes, they have the power to make you experience the bests and worsts of your life at the same time. Indeed we experience the dreams, not just see them. How else can you explain your turning, jumping, twisting, crawling, grawling in the sleep. We are experiencing the event, the dream. I myself have woken up thanking god for turning whatever i experienced into a dream. And then there are those times when i just put myself to sleep again, just to experience what remained incomplete, unexperienced.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Further, the dreams are mutable portkeys. I feel i change lives in dreams. Butterfly effect you can say. But there one can decide if he wants to change his life. Here i don’t. It all depends on my other self, the dreaming threaded me. If he wants me there, i go. Otherwise i just lay here, wake up and continue.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Details. Two threads, if dreaming together, show how the life each is experiencing. We exchange both the positives and negatives. Yes, if you notice, each dream comprises of both goods and bads. We experience some scenes of that life, both happened and yet to happen. Yucks and Wows. If both agree to switch, we switch.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now you see this concept explains a lot of usualities. Take Deja Vu. Yes indeed it is that ‘yet-to-happen’ scene of the life. We experienced it in the dream before we made the shift. Those jerky wake ups. May be the other self just slapped me for spending such sucking life. Or may be i did it to him for his sucking life. Roaming with unknowns. Yes, you don’t afterall expect two me’s having the same set of friends. Those long nights can be the result of just a mismatch between timings of two threads. Same goes for the short nights.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I will stop. Remove your thinking caps and plunge into the dreamland with the view. You might find quite a few interesting answers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyways back to my dream i dreamed yesterday. I dreamed i was a singer, i was singing well. (Ok, i never said the other me has to be “me”ish. He can indeed me quite contradictory to who i am right?) Audience were happy. I saw my struggle. I saw my first assignment. I was watching myself happy. I watched all the happy me’s. Nothing bad. No yucks. And suddenly it was blank. I don’t remember something like this happening earlier. The dreams changed. The places changed. I woke up suddenly. But it never happened that the dream turned blank, with me facing eternity full of whiteness.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Puzzled, I lay there, closed eyed and open minded, waiting for something to happen. But all in vain. Blank. Whiteness everywhere. Finally i woke up and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tottered my way along<!-- raw HTML omitted --> … With mind full of questions. Unanswered question.</p>

			 <p>Tomorrow I am going to travel through the time to the future me. It’s been long that I was planning for one such tour. However just for the need of the future currency, I had to postpone my travel to tomorrow.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In a moment, my friend will return from his visit. I have asked him to smuggle some future currency back to the past. To maintain the time conundrum, I will believe that, as of today, I do not know if he does bring it in. (However the fact remains that I have made the travel tomorrow. So this should clarify the doubts over whether he did. He did. Successfully. Believe me!)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Anyway there was some small calculation mistake while carrying the digit forward, which I normally do, that made me end up a day behind where I was supposed to end at, i.e. tomorrow. Now I do not want to disturb the normalities in here, the past world that is. So I will prefer hiding in this panic room and simply pen down my experiences of this drive.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The first and foremost observation, technology has spoiled the human race in there man. People only speak in command prompt queries. A sentence is no longer than 3 words, the longest (and oldest) being “I am sorry”. (And even there, people hardly mean it!)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Every single software is run by Google and hardware designed by Apple. There is an antique building called “Microsoft Live Centre”. I heard it has hanged in the messy green screen of death that displays a Matrixsque live feed of random numbers. Some say it has gone offline from the day it’s services were tagged “Live”. (By the way, don’t tell anyone. but there were still rumours about the apple tablet and google phone.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However fun was when I met my future me. The way he was behaving I still feel, as <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Zaphod Beeblebrox<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> would say, “if I ever met myself again, I will hit myself so hard I won’t know what’s hit me.”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>By the way I wanted to tweet this there and then itself. But that future me just laughed at me when I said it takes 140 characters for us to share what we are doing. He mentioned even the novels are 20-30 characters long in there. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->crypto-tex-pander<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fitted in each person’s eyes just completes the novel. Idiots I tell you.</p>

<p>Sat for lunch and there there was another surprise. Those idiots there hardly eat any food. They just gobble down the pills for all the necessary vitamins, minerals and whatever necessary for the body. Floored I was to see they even have the pills for the junk food. These future mens are idiots. Extreme idiots.</p>

<p>Oops!! Need to hide. Someone is crawling towards this dark damp corner. Will blab out the remaining idiocracies of the future. Trust me. There are many. Did I tell you what they have a UCC, a Universe Conservation Committee, a group fighting the Universal Enpansion? Well they do. Blab you later. Ciao!</p>

			 <p>Just finished watching “The Negotiator”. A tense drama between two negotiators that was . Well at least for three-fourth of the movie. After which I think the director fell prey for the behaviour which I am seeing a lot recently. However I have no intention here to post a review about the movie.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Actually these days I have lost belief that reviews actually hold any credibility. Not just do I find them monetarily inspired, but they are also dependent on many external factors. This makes it practically impossible for two viewers to watch a movie with same frame of mind and same expectations.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Well not to forget the reviews themselves rig their own viewpoint on the moviegoers. So a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Taran Adarsh<!-- raw HTML omitted --> might make each Yash Raj Film an extreme must watch while <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Masand<!-- raw HTML omitted --> makes the same one the extreme bore of all time. Two thumps down he would scream. However what the movie ends up being is not any of those.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Not just is this case true for the actual critics whose bread and butter is film reviewing. Even friends that unwelcomely review a movie for me, make it difficult for me to watch any. One likes any movie he watches, another says “ah Bollywood sucks”.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So hardly is it possible for me to decide which movie to watch based on anyone’s comments. Ironically the most of the movies that I have loved recently are the ones where I had no clue about their plot or performances. So no reviews for me I say.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Anyway back to the pit that most of the directors fall in. I call it the “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->lets-make-it-goody-goody<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot; pit. See when you have made a strong impression on audience by throwing at them what they least expected, you don’t take an unwanted <!-- raw HTML omitted -->faltu<!-- raw HTML omitted --> turn saying “Hehe buddy, there I fooled you.”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One most cliche scene I would like to mention. In a movie with 2 heroes, one kills other at the most unthinkable stage. Only is it revealed momentarily after that both were together in this and no one’s killed. That was part of the bigger plan. Villain is caught and yippie, everything is goody-goody.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Well, screw you Mr. Goody G. Goody. You could have made the movie hell lot better by killing that god damn hero, and making this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gaddar<!-- raw HTML omitted --> friend fly away with villain and all the money. Why is there a mental block to show “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->achhe ki jeet aur bure ki haar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot; (good wins bad leans)? Well not that this is how the real world behaves, is it?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Anyway even extreme wonderful movies like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Departed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> could not dodge this pit. Only thing I can say is it takes guts to end movie with not so “goody-goody” a situation. I remember one movie which managed to do that. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Mist<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I still fell saddened when I remember the ending there. Hats off to you Mr. Frank Darabont the director. You had managed to give a most unthinkable horror an horror movie can give its audience. Extreme unthinkable.</p>

			 <p>He gets up in the morning and sees sun rising at him through the small slit, left open at the window by curtains. It is that soothing early morning which he has always savored. He crawls out of his bed and takes a warm shower. He gets all tidied up with a desire to embrace the pleasing spring morning. He puts his foot outside and starts his walk towards the office.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hardly does he walk hundred meters, dark clouds start gathering the sky. He looks at the sun and loses him among the clouds.  The spring morning is ruined by the darkness of the clouds hovering above. They roar and kill the sweet chirping noise of the birds and burst into a heavy uncalled and untimely rain suddenly.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now the situation above is not just a one off incident.  It is not the roaring clouds or the rain that bothers me. It is the untimely fashion one faces them. Any living person can personify the “he” described above.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Have many times will I lure days in and out just for a moist rainy morning only to end up to be greeted by scorching heat?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->How many times will I leave the house to spend a pleasant summer weekend at the beach with family or friends only to end up sipping sodas in a closed car peeking at the pouring rain?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why should I always carry the sunscreen lotion and the umbrella with me irrespective of which season it is?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As an Indian, I was blessed with distinguished 3 seasons. But these days everything has changed. Winters aren’t chilly. Summers have intermittent burst of clouds. Rainy seasons have hardly 30 days of rain. I won’t be exaggerating if I say that summers have more rains now than actual rainy seasons.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don’t know if this is actually a result of Global Warming phenomenon. I don’t know if this is really a effect of greenhouse gases. There are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->facts and figures<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which say they are. Then there are those who say this is just a cyclic effect. This does happen in centuries where climate behavior repeats itself.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For me what matters is what I see and I can guarantee something is for sure not normal. I am tired of watching farmers committing suicides because the climate does not behave as it should. I am tired of watching crops getting ruined by the lack or or sudden pouring of rains. I am tired of watching people die because of all the floods and droughts, storms and tsunami. I am really tired.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->effects<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of, if it exists, global warming are pretty saddening.  I had decided I won’t take the risk of ruining what has been a pretty wonderful place to live. I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->will do whatever<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I can for that and have already started that by thinking about it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After all I don’t want to end up telling my grandchildren, “Once there were seasons and climate changed with them”. And I surely don’t want any one to end like this.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You know that time when you just back out of a thing which might have saved you some bucks? It happens to me a lot, but this particular week gave me a double blow.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->First incident was when i did not back out when i should, though debatable, have. I trolled along the darling harbor idling my time out just because i did not have any other place to go. Out of no dire need, i felt this itch to go to the public telephone booth and, well, do nothing.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I picked up the handset and there began my efforts to place a call. I don’t know why but this bud was heavily reluctant to let me do so. I gave up, placed the dial back and put my hand to get the coin back. In the open mouthed telephone lied another $2 coin with my $1 coin.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fuzzy that my mind always is, there began a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mahabharat <!-- raw HTML omitted -->between my ethical and non-ethical brain cells. Should i or should not pick this $2 up which does not belong to me? I don’t remember for how long i stayed near the booth but last thing i remember i had extra $2 in my pocket. Debatable if i should have picked the coin, but i did.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fast forwarding 2 hours later. My idling location shifted to a mall where after about an hour i decided i have crossed my idling quota for the week.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I came out with my iPod plugged in and whistled along the road towards train station and somehow felt everything was pretty bright around me. I knew i had a train in another 15 mins which i should not miss as there was no other train for another 90minutes. My eyes burnt and my subconscious mind was aching for something. And there it dawn on me why everything was indeed bright.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next thing i remember i was running towards the mall to find my goggles worth way more than $2 i had picked up earlier. Whole time during my run to the mall i was thinking was that $2 really worth all this pain of losing costly goggles and missing train.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Final blow, however, was about to come. I reached the mall, found a sensible looking pretty lady and asked if they have found any goggles. She looked more optimistic than what I was. She ambled inside putting me on hold. After some time, she came out and said something which ignited my fuzzy brain cells again.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->She said they have found one goggles, but they were ladies and if I think mine were, well, ladies goggles, she will get them from the security. Now I did not want to make complete fool of myself in front to pretty looking and sounding girl by saying I wear ladies goggles. But i did not want to not make any try too.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I thought for sometime what to do and then putting my manly pride ahead, I remember I mumbled something and came out. Whole time afterwards, i was soothing myself by thinking this.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A visit to a supermarket is not something uncommon for me. Rather it is one thing which i like doing the most. Crawling between those numerous branches full of variety of products, i just lose myself glancing at each one’s properties… beep .. engineer’s blooper .. i should have said “each one’s labels”.</p>
<p>However, the visits are always satisfying and refreshing for me. And this is the first reason i find myself roaming in these lanes quite often.</p>
<p>Another reason for these frequent ferries is my lack of interest in creating the grocery lists. I have tried jotting them few times, but i so get lost within the products catalog that the chit doozes in my pockets.</p>
<p>At times i spend hours just ambling around the nooks and corners of a supermarket. A sensible mind might think what would one do for so long in a place so crowded, so noisy, so meaningless and so mean. But thats what i like about this place. I get my space in here with no one remotely worried about what i want. And that’s when i start getting choosy about each and everything i would buy out of this space.</p>
<p>First thing i need to do is put a limit on time i would spend in there. Once that is sorted out, it is all about marking my spots to ski along. Vegetables and fruits fall out of my interest and a hustling visit settles down the formality.</p>
<p>What follows is a child-like admiration for the variety of products manufactured, packaged, transported, marketed and sold at such colorful a place. A cheerful mouthfreshner sits in front of the saddened and ashamed toilet cleaner. Colorful chocolates sit next to the colorless eggs. And there i know its time to get lost. Get choosy.</p>
<p>And choosy i get. Tens of minutes are spent in front of each product looking for what fits better for my needs. I know sometimes i have spent too much time and worried i get thinking the cameras might caught me goofing around at the same position and i might be busted as potential terrorist. But what the hell  .. risk is worth it.</p>
<p>And then there are those times when i don’t get choosy thinking i know what i want and i have got what i want. And this is what i buy.</p>

<p>And this is what the description read (which i happen to read when i rinsed my mouth with this dude)</p>

			 <p>These days i am going through some wonderful experiences. Major chunk for this: I have the routine in Bangalore broken. I was fed up with the same life style. Same road. Same bus. Same timings. Same place. Same updates. Same people. And even same dogs!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Life at Australia has given me that chance to break the shackles with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->usuality<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The life has changed and so have people, places around me. I am not a pleasure freak. The only thing I ask for is the change. For that matter I do not even mind spending my days at a village as long as I get a break from usual casualties of life.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Casualties they are. Each moment each day life throws loads and loads of experiences at you. Some are feather soft. Providing you with the feel-good comfort in its zone. And then there are those emotion laden heavy experiences trying to crush you under it’s weight. Casualties to your mind is what they can leave behind. And casualties is what they leave behind.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So the break was indeed welcome. It has indeed been welcome. For the better part of this change is the feeling of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->differentness<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But this same “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->differentness<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot; is what pops up in between; a small compartment in mind still calls out for those same buses. Those same roads. Those same people. And those same dogs. In between some times a thought does crawl in the mind; a thought calling out for those &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->usualities<!-- raw HTML omitted -->”. Calling out loud for the sameness in the life.</p>

			 <p>I had earlier prated at facebook about how things never go wrong but they usually are wrong. This post is more about the incident that made me babble that out.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This particular incident is not a one off experience. It happens with me most of the time. I have started believing the quote, that one gets what he gets only when the time is right, far strongly than ever before.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So right from the morning today, i was hopelessly beating my head against numerous things interconnected. Code not getting configured, tools not running properly, system slowing down like hell … and what not. In simple terms, all the things that could possibly go wrong were going wrong.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tried my best to bring things back on track. Even tried the ever successful way out of chanting random rants in the loo. But nothing seamed to work. Day went by with me fighting the villainous time. And suddenly right on the verge of me giving up, something happened and everything got sorted out.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I felt like yash raj was scripting a movie with me, the helpless protagonist waiting for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->non-hero-non-villain types <!-- raw HTML omitted -->neutral time to sort things out, a la Amrish puri in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DDLJ<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Here ditto Yash Raj’s script, how the solution appears does not matter.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Many times the all time hidden <!-- raw HTML omitted -->problem creators<!-- raw HTML omitted --> suddenly loom out of nothingness. Or at times the same components which were adamant on not working get a mind change and start working. You sit there dumbfound trying to grasp what happened.

			 <p>Another day spent with hardly any interesting updates in life. Truly speaking many things happen.

			 <p>The title does sound, atleast for me, a bit self-boasting one. I dunno about others for whom &lsquo;being mysterious&rsquo; may quite well turn out to be &lsquo;yuck&rsquo;ish. (I know even my use of words sometimes is mysterious. You would surely have, if you have roamed round this blogosphere enough, come across many.)   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Anyway mysteries has always kept on the edge of my seat. I have cherished even the worst of the mystery movies ever made. I even have a darn respect (!!!) for the makers of few of the movies, whose reason for existence itself was a mystery. Same goes for books or for TV shows. But more than anything else, what turn me on are the mysterious real life experiences. I have spend lots of my network bandwidth digging through the news stories about however foolish but mysterious incidences that happen around us. And it was this interest of mine that led to the existence of another blog of mine. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Realm of Mysteries<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Along the journey there, I will keep on jotting few mysteries i, over the net, bump into. The stories may not be fully inclusive of all details as I have no intention to &lsquo;wikipedia&rsquo;ize the blog. Though they surely will provide required links for fully understanding them.</p>

<p>But before moving straight to the answer, let me take you through the line of thoughts my mutable mind followed along. A plain look at the title and it made me think &lsquo;Damn!! How on earth did they find that? Were they running around, scissors in hand, chopping each and every frog they cross, looking for their bloody bellies (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->pun intended<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) for any abnormalities in them? And what did they think of as an answer they would provided to all those normal, but with a robbed sac like belly, frogs? Would a &ldquo;Hey sorry mate! We are searching for your deviant buddy. By the way, do contact a doc soon.&rdquo; do? Nah it won&rsquo;t. How can they be so irresponsible towards the nature. They indeed are answerable to the frog fraternity.&rsquo; Now i don&rsquo;t think this path is too abnormal. Any sensible one would have thought on the same lines. I felt mighty of myself for being so empathetic and felt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that this needed to be blogged<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But that feeling wasn&rsquo;t there to last for long.</p>
<p>As i strolled through the story, the reality came into picture. The answer for &ldquo;what was it that they have&rdquo; earlier arose. It takes loads of  patience, time and prolonged interest for hitting something so uninteresting and so &ldquo;evolutionarily unique&rdquo;, as they call it, head-on. How else can you explain the fact that when the friends of this enlightened scientists were busy lurking  behind the materialistic pleasures, his majesty was busy searching for this mighty frog community, one of whose member he saw when he was 30 years younger. It required a mind full of unsatisfiable quests and determination not to find solution. How else would you explain the fact that once he did find one of them, he continued his quest to find 8 of their kinds and tore their lungless tummies apart before going &ldquo;EUREKA&rdquo;. I thought this answer that i mined was &lsquo;pen&rsquo;able and again felt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that this needed to be blogged<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I wish this was enough. But they went on to explain how their closest relatives had lungs and what that really means. Finally they didn&rsquo;t even forget to connect this with manly attempts to ruin the mother earth and a need to stop doing the same. Also a call at the end to protect earth from  facing this &ldquo;huge impact&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now all this was enough to make me feel <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that this needed to be blogged<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And hence this attempt. Anyways now their&rsquo;s some other line my thoughts are following. It is after i saw few similar titles that read &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Man charged with theft left his son<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;,  &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Robber left name on job application<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; and &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Suspect took cab to and from the bank he robbed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;. Let me know your line of thought. I will post mine soon. Think&hellip; Think&hellip; Think&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>All of the above, though being pretty random, just couldn&rsquo;t motivate me. But as i was bluntly looking at my blog today, few striking facts about my previous post held my attention. First, my post was on Feb 14th, Mr.Valentine&rsquo;s &lsquo;some&rsquo;day. And topic was &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Earn Security, but at a price&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ldquo;. Though quite unintentional, but see what great sense it makes. Its this rosy day, that if you enjoy, you have to lose your liberty (control myself?? forget&hellip; ), equality (how dare one asks to be equal with the almighty partner), justice (when i know i have to agree that the person in front has to be right, whats the point asking for justice), freedom (what freedom can a criminal expect when he sentenced life imprisonment for himself). You do this and you sure will earn security, security for commitment. Just make sure you do burn your entirety.</p>

<p>Answer: When the chunk of metal that serves as the official international standard for the kilogram, under triple lock-and-key in France since 1889, inexplicably sheds a little weight.Very little, though.

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I always come up with a statement &ldquo;Sachin is not a Match Winner&rdquo;. And if you try to go to the depth of the statement, you will find that the people mainly complain about following issues:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) He never sails india to victory.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) He is never there till the end.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3) He never strikes in a crucial stage.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4) He never plays well in finals.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->5) He plays only on the Batsmen Friendly Indian Pitches<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->6) He is not like Lara, Steve Waugh or Bevan.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Before we start looking at each issue, lets try to answer a couple of questions first:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) Who is a Match Winner?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) Can a single person win the matches for a country?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ok so lets move to the first question. So is &ldquo;Match Winner&rdquo; the one who stays till the end? If that&rsquo;s the case then Srinath and Kumble were the match winners in the 3rd match of Titan Cup played against Australia on 21st October 1996. But still the man of the match award was given to the Sachin. Because he was holding one end of the indian innings when the greats like Dravid, Ganguly and Azar were making their way to pavalion. He was sailing India home with a great victory but for a good ball which he just happened to misjudge. This was the innings that created a base for the &ldquo;rare&rdquo; nice flicks from the two Bangaloreans and made them to take India to a fantastic win and they get full credit for doing it with perfection.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now lets consider a Test Match. Take the 2nd test of the Border-Gavaskar trophy played against Australia on 26-30 December 1999. The first innings of Australia saw 405 runs. Thanks to great innings by Slater, Langer, Gilchrist and even some fine knocks by Fleming and Lee down the order. India&rsquo;s 1st innings score was 238 which had a fine inning of 116 from the Little Master. He was the 9th man to get out. Then Australia scored 208 runs before declaring their second innings. In the responce, India just managed to score 195 runs again having an inning of 52 from Tendulkar. But then he could not sail india to victory at last. Still the man of the match was given to him. Can we imply from this test that Sachin was not a match winner as he didn&rsquo;t won the test for india? No we can&rsquo;t!!!!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But then you again can&rsquo;t say that Sachin was the match winner in the First match we discussed. No he wasn&rsquo;t. On the contrary, no one can be a match winner in a team game like Cricket. You cannot neglect the support he got from Jadeja and Mongia that helped him to to take india on the verge of a win and then the nice flicks from Srinath and Kumble that sailed India to victory. You cannot forget even a small contribution of 30 odd runs in Cricket because that, with a partnership, counts big. Even in case of the test discussed, same thing would have happened if sachin would have got some support from his fellow teammates. The fault was not Sachin&rsquo;s — it was just that India could not find a Fleming/Lee who could score some runs down the order in the first innings.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->People may query &ldquo;why are you just considering these two innings?&rdquo; Or may be something like &ldquo;You are getting biased&rdquo;. But then I am not discussing the greatness of Sachin. I am just trying to judge the statement about match winner concept which I totally disbelieve exists. I think these facts are good enough to prove that the fist two issues can be discarded when you say he is not the match winner and very well answer the two questions we developed.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So lets move to 3rd and 4th issues. I think these don&rsquo;t need to be discussed seperately as they are too similar. No situation can be more crucial than the final of a series. Here i will just like to ask one simple question. How many of these finals would india have reached but for Sachin? Does it not take some fine performances to win the matches which take us to the final? C&rsquo;mon man. After all he is an human being who too has got limits. Nobody in the world can be perfect and neither is Sachin. But the mere fact that he doesn&rsquo;t play in finals unlike few others (not Indians offcourse because i guess no indians play well in finals) doesn&rsquo;t reduce his briliance.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Or it can again not imply/disprove that he is not a match winner.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The fifth query can be considered in two parts. 1) On Batsmen friendly pitches: Ok then i think this is a part of the game. Sachin is a batsmen and every batsmen is considered to play well on batsmen friendly pitches. But it will be wrong to say that he plays only on batsmen friendly tracks. Because he do have a few innings under his belt to disprove this statement including the ones at bulawayo and johannesburg against Zim and SA. Lets move to second part.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2)On Indian pithces: This statement will be best judged by few statistics which I will soon come up with.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lets move to the last and the most important comment. He is obviously not like Waugh, Lara, Inzi. He is far ahead of Waugh and Inzi and in case of Lara, I will just say its better not to judge one greats performance in the vision of the others. But I can say one thing. Sachin may not be a Steve Waugh but then he does not have a Warne, Gillespie or Lee who could win a match by hitting the last few runs after he scores a century. Lara and Waugh both had great teams to back their efforts, not just a few good players like what Sachin has. Tendulkar has shone as the lone gladiator for India.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I think everybody should stop worrying about who is a batter match winner and enjoy the game of all the greats. One thing is for sure. Today, when Sachin goes out to bat, he has over a billion people praying for him. So, whether he is a MATCH-WINNER or not, who cares: he is a HEART-WINNER. Today&rsquo;s great moments are tommorow&rsquo;s sweet memories. Though Dravid might be &ldquo;the great WALL of India&rdquo;, if you look beyond the wall you can see a monument, an &ldquo;Unconquerable Everest&rdquo;, in Sachin Tendulkar.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the end, I would just like to put a plain request to all those who debate on this topic. Just leave the man, who has given 14 years of his life to his passion, alone and don&rsquo;t put him under a microscope. This will sure help you enjoy the numerous innings he had played and the numerous he is yet to play. I CONGRATS THE LITTLE MASTER for all the fine innings he has played and wish him all the best for his remaining carrier. So bowlers beware. SACHIN AALA RE!!!!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
