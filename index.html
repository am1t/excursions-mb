		<a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2024/02/11/update-on-nosyndication.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-02-11 22:21:32 &#43;0530">Feb 11, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Exactly <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2024/01/11/i-will-no.html">a month ago</a>, I decided to stop syndicating my posts to any social networks. What have I learnt in this month?</p>
<p>The interactions on my posts have significantly gone down. Every post had some replies earlier. No surprise, most were on Micro.blog. A few were on Mastodon. Both have naturally gone down to zero. I have received a few emails (and fewer comments through Commento). I responded to each of them, which is something I cannot say about the earlier replies I received on the timelines. My genuine lack of interest in checking my mentions and responding to them was why I had stopped syndication.</p>
<p>How about traffic (<em>yuck!</em>)? I have no clue. Though I have analytics enabled with <a href="https://tinylytics.app/">Tinylytics</a>, I don&rsquo;t follow the numbers. I don&rsquo;t know what the numbers were earlier and how they have been impacted. There is also a possibility that most follow my blog through RSS. Whatever the case, I don&rsquo;t know, and I don&rsquo;t have any interest in finding out.</p>
<p>The most noticeable impact has been on my writing &ndash; I have stopped writing for a timeline.</p>
<p>Earlier, I subconsciously filtered all my posts through the lens of how they would look on a timeline. Or to the folks who tend to reply to my posts frequently. <em>Is this too long? Too short? Does this interest all? Or some? Or anyone at all?</em>  My mind was always crowded with such unnecessary doubts. I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/05/24/193000.html">observed this behaviour first</a> a couple of years ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing publicly, with the voice of your readers chirping at the back of your mind, is ineffective. You write for interaction ‚Äì that&rsquo;s futile. Most social media posts belong to this category. You are reined back by the voice ‚Äî you write for someone else. The response you expect from them, your readers, provides you the lead. You write not what you like, you write what you think your reader likes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I even mentioned people through their social media handles in my posts. Futile, I agree. But the whole experience felt unnecessarily limiting, and I lacked the control to not let it feel.</p>
<p>What does all of this mean for my no-syndication experiment? As of now, nothing has changed. I like this unshackled feeling while I write. As if no one&rsquo;s watching and weighing up my every word.</p>
<p>How about taking my writing to the readers? I am yet to find an organic way to do that. Automatic <em>and passive</em> syndication is not that.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday, I was sitting with my iPad Mini on the sunny balcony, with my sister&rsquo;s iPhone and my Galaxy S24 Ultra next to me. Barely able to read on my iPad, I picked up my phone and was reminded how I had fallen absolutely in love with this device. Especially the two aspects. The stunning screen. The monstrous battery life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I have seen <strong>a better screen</strong> than what this has. All reviews have called it out. But you must experience it to appreciate the brilliance of what Samsung has achieved. The text is crisp; the colours pop out. Plus, the lack of reflection is mindblowing. I don&rsquo;t think I can go back to any other device now that doesn&rsquo;t have the technical wizardry that Samsung has packaged here. It&rsquo;s perfectly visible even in the harshest sunlight without losing clarity or colour.</p>
<p>I am surprised no one built such a screen earlier. This is much more important than the high refresh rate or crazy resolutions. Here&rsquo;s a snapshot from <a href="https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s24-ultra/">the official product page</a>.Ôªø</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>ÔªøThe second one is also a no-brainer with its trade-off &ndash; <strong>the battery life</strong>. Since moving to smartphones in 2009 with the iPhone 3GS, I haven&rsquo;t had any phone with a battery life longer than a day. But then I also stubbornly preferred phones with smaller dimensions. I never liked the likes of Notes and Plueses and Pros and Maxes. So, my decision to shift to a large phone this time was clouded by my fear of discomfort.</p>
<p>All my fears were washed away right on the second day when my phone wasn&rsquo;t screaming at me to be plugged in. My last phone, the Galaxy S22, was the slickest of all the devices I have ever owned. But it was frustrating to put it to charging every evening. From that to now, when I am easily going through two full days without charging my phone, it is a drastic (and welcome) change. <em>Even three days once</em>. This might be a benefit that all large phones share. But with everything this device packs, it has to be the best amongst the best.</p>
<p>Even without the natural benefit of a larger screen to read and write better, I would always select a larger phone from now on just for the battery life it lends.</p>
<p>In addition, there are miscellaneous benefits of Samsung&rsquo;s versions of Android phones for me. They have been nailing the physical design of the phones for the past few years. Without all the gloss, they look and feel premium in hand. Everyone who has held this device has commended the richness of its feel.</p>
<p>One UI feels slick, elevating the overall Android experience a notch higher. It&rsquo;s inherently Google but distinctly Samsung at the same time. All the small touches they add across the platform are well thought through. The ones that I have found the most used are <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00083201/">Modes and Routines</a>. It helps set your phone for different phases of the day. I can customize all aspects, the most important being which apps I access during a particular mode. For example, in Life mode, I have set it so that I can&rsquo;t use any apps from my work even if I wanted to. Neither do I get notifications from them. Ôªø</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>ÔªøSamsung has woven a lot of such small additions into the platform. S Pen works nicely. The side Panel stays hidden, yet it is extremely useful. Dex is <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2023/01/11/android-has-a.html">an absolute stunner</a>. And the list goes on.</p>
<p>This post has gone on for much longer than I initially expected. And I haven&rsquo;t even talked about the cameras. With Galaxy S24 Ultra, Samsung has indeed mastered the smartphone.</p>

			 <p>Maya <a href="https://maya.land/monologues/2023/12/26/laptop-of-the-magi-apple-antitrust.html">narrates an annoying annectode</a> involving iMessages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By buying my mother a gift, I have now made it so that her contacts with iPhones, who all have her email saved, will ‚Äì by default ‚Äì send her messages that she cannot access on her phone, and they won‚Äôt know that they‚Äôre doing this when trying to text her. This seems terrible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <em>is</em> terrible. I recall I had gone through a similar frenzy when I had switched from my iPhone to Android. Getting back my messages from the clutches of iMessages was so painful. I had to go through this again when I bought my iMac and <em>Apple decided</em> I want messages with my email. It&rsquo;s frustrating to see the limits Apple goes to to decide on its user&rsquo;s behalf what&rsquo;s best for them. I really resonate with this thought from Maya (emphasis mine).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If they‚Äôd just built their own thing in a separate app that needed both sides <em>to explicitly opt-in</em> to use in their communication, I wouldn‚Äôt be writing this!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amen! Only saving grace is there are not many in my family or friends circle who use iPhone.</p>

			 <p>At the start of every year, I read posts from people where they set goals for themselves. I love the theme, but setting goals or resolutions doesn&rsquo;t work well. I am not a stickler for goal tracking.</p>
<p>Recently, I read a couple of posts where people put out a list of <em>their hopes</em> for the year. <a href="https://mei.bearblog.dev/24-hopes-for-2024/">Latest from mei</a>. This inspired me to pen one for myself. I thought I might struggle to create such a list when I started writing this. It was surprisingly simple when I put them in buckets - self, health, relationships and interests. So, here we go!</p>
<ol>
<li>Write more than I did in 2023 - target 365 posts</li>
<li>Read one book in a month - target 12 books</li>
<li>Publish one short story</li>
<li>Find a medium that helps me be social on the web</li>
<li>Find a place for music in my life again</li>
<li>Make a journal entry at least once a week</li>
<li>Keep <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/#stories">stories</a> on my website updated with one new photo every week</li>
<li>Go on a date with my wife once a month</li>
<li>Go on a play date with my daughter once a month</li>
<li>Family dinner with my wife and daughter once a month</li>
<li>Take one picture of my daughter and one of me &amp; my wife every week</li>
<li>Meet my two friends circle once a month</li>
<li>Inspire interest in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@curiousbee">Curious Bee</a> to create again</li>
<li>Find and connect with people whose ideas resonate with me</li>
<li>Improve physical fitness by walking 5 days a week</li>
<li>Improve mental fitness by meditating 5 days a week</li>
<li>Do Pranayama and Surya Namaskar at least 2 times a week</li>
<li>Take care of my face</li>
<li>Achieve better work-life balance, <em>minimize life during work</em></li>
<li>Learn to cook roti</li>
<li>Visit a cafe alone once a month</li>
<li>Speak up my mind, even if it disappoints others</li>
<li>Learn to use the calendar to structure day and week</li>
<li>Learn to use my smartphone better for reading and writing</li>
</ol>
<p>I accept it&rsquo;s slightly late to publish such a list. But I have already been working on a few of these. Plus, it&rsquo;s better late than never.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t posted anything since I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2024/01/28/i-am-leaning.html">last wondered</a> &ldquo;why I even write anymore in public&rdquo;. This question still crowds my mind. But I read what other folks write, which, in turn, makes me want to do that. So, I am <em>not</em> going to stop writing on my blog anytime soon.</p>
<p>What do I write about? Well, about nothing and everything. That has been my mantra.</p>
<p>I usually do not have a set template for my posts. I start writing, and the thoughts pour themselves out. The only thing I have to do is sit down at my desk and start hammering on my keyboard.</p>
<p>Recently, I read some excellent posts on blogging versus social media. The first is Robb Knight talking about how <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/the-web-is-fantastic/">the web is fantastic</a>. This feeling resonated with my current state of mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blogs and RSS never died. Some of us just took a little break from it while we all shitposted on Twitter for likes, retweets, and validation. While we wrote long, unfindable threads instead of blog posts. I&rsquo;m as guilty of this as anyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s been some time now since I posted to any social network. <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2024/01/11/i-will-no.html">20 days to be exact</a>. It&rsquo;s freeing to not worry about how my posts look on different timelines or how people react to them. I write on <em>and for</em> my blog. I have also accepted that I won&rsquo;t get any reaction on even my most thoughtful posts.</p>
<p>I have yet to find a frictionless way to respond to a post I read. <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2024/01/21/i-wish-every.html">I want that</a>.</p>
<p>The second post is <a href="https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/blogging-is-where-its-at-again/">Chris McLeod vouching for the resurgence of blogging</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[S]tumbling into such a trove of active blogs has enthused me about blogging as a medium again. It&rsquo;s sparked a thought that through a combination of increased blogging activity, declining platforms, and increasing adoption of open standards to glue everything together, that maybe ‚Äî just maybe ‚Äî we can swing the web back towards the blog again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I share Chris&rsquo;s optimism &ndash; posting micro thoughts on social media led to the discovery of many good bloggers. I maintain my apprehensions about micro posts on the blog &ndash; <em>I cannot write and post them</em>. But I am okay with others doing it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I continue to read blogs through RSS. I continue to write on my blog. All&rsquo;s well.</p>

			 <p>I am leaning towards a theory as I stay away from all the social timelines these days. There are more writers on the web today than there are readers. More words are written and published by diverse voices on the internet than there are people following them. Responding to them.</p>
<p>Writing on the web feels more like shouting into the void. Words tend to get lost.</p>
<p>Why else would I find some gems of the posts every day that are not recommended by anyone? Or on any forum. On social timelines, most people superficially react to such posts. But very few are getting involved in deeper conversations. What&rsquo;s worse is forget appreciation; such posts aren&rsquo;t acknowledged either. On the other hand, superficial reactions are more straightforward and often have an ulterior and selfish motive.</p>
<p>I am afraid the methods of organic discovery of good individual blogs and blog posts are failing us. They worked a decade or so back. They don&rsquo;t anymore. There are just too many good writers out there. With setting up platforms for blogging becoming a lot simpler, the number will only rise.</p>
<p>The thought makes me wonder why I even write anymore in public. Why do I add to the noise that the web is turning (<em>or has already turned</em>) into now?</p>
<p>In a cacophony of deafening chatter, even a symphony is noise if not acknowledged.</p>

			 <p>I have been feeling like shit for the last few days. Even more so today. I think I have lost all the control over my ability to decide what I do these days. I just go with the flow for the whole day, doing what is in front of me.</p>
<p>The thing about feeling like shit is the fact that you are feeling like shit makes you feel shittier. <em>A vicious cycle</em>.</p>
<p>Sure, these are in no way the worst days. But there&rsquo;s an unknown burden always lurking around. Burden of not doing things as planned. Or the burden of not having a plan at all. I want to put a routine into my life. But my sustained inability to do so is becoming burdensome now.</p>
<p>And yet, I don&rsquo;t gauge the days by its productivity. Why should I? I don&rsquo;t want to stitch a hyper-productive routine for myself. So, the lack of achievement in a day doesn&rsquo;t bother me. I keep things simple &ndash; as long as I read some, write some and spend quality family time, I should be happy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s painful when this <em>uncomplicated</em> happiness doesn&rsquo;t feel enough.</p>
<p>I do all the simple things without overcomplicating the problem. But I am unable to stop myself from doing the inessential. Open the same news websites again and again. Scroll meaninglessly. Read something vain. Watch something hollow. Build checklists of tasks. Mindlessly tick them off.</p>
<p>Meaningless. One word for the feeling. <em>Mindless</em>. The another.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to achieve a lot in a day. But I would love it to be meaningful. I want to do things consciously. Not do just those that are in front of me. Or are easy. Because easy leans towards absurd. Easy keeps me oblivious. Easy is hollow.</p>
<p>Easy makes me feel like shit.</p>

			 <p>A long time ago, I had bookmarked an article on the story behind the new search engine Neeva. I came across that article again today only to find that the search engine is no longer publically available. Is there any point of reading it anymore? Yet I did.</p>
<p>Reading the article now made me realize most often, the reasons that the makers of a technology give for its existence and their plans for its long term survival is all just hubris.</p>

			 <p>I received yesterday the Galaxy 24 Ultra that <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2024/01/20/when-i-upgraded.html">I had preordered</a>. A quick opinion after a day&rsquo;s use &ndash; I am mighty impressed. Stunning display. Monstrous battery. And a brilliant camera &ndash; I have taken a few shots in low light and portraits, and boy, am I impressed. This is the basic feature set that matters to me.</p>
<p>With a place now for <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/#stories">my snaps on my website</a>, I am going to have so much fun taking pictures with this set of cameras.</p>
<p>Coming from a smaller screen size of Galaxy S22, I was very worried that I might not like the massive size jump. But I think <em>I am going to love this size</em>. It has a lot of space for all the elements on the screen. One that also renders a lot of crisp words &ndash; I am now on the lookout for more to read.</p>
<p>The overall experience feels buttery smooth. The feel in the hand is light, yet premium. Plus, did I say that I love the larger screen on the phone!?</p>

			 <p>I wish every blog post had a footer with easy ways to respond, preferably via email. The early days of blogging were simple, with a plain comments section. All one had to do was add details about themselves and comment. Spam ruined the simplicity, and accounts were required to be created just to add a comment.</p>
<p>I yearn for those simpler days. I recently added a way to comment below my posts, powered by <a href="https://commento.io/">Commento</a>. The simplicity of this system does have a price associated with it. But I want to keep that option around since I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2024/01/11/i-will-no.html">stopped syndicating</a> posts to the social timelines.</p>
<p>Plus, the readers can always respond via email. I am relieved to see responses received through both of these mediums.</p>
<p>At the same time, it pains me when I open a blog post looking for a way to respond, and I can&rsquo;t find any. Even if there is one, it is generally via some social network, which I am not keen to participate in. Please have a link to respond via email. Someday, you will receive a thoughtful response that will warm your heart.</p>

			 <p>When I upgraded to Galaxy S22 a couple of years back, I wrote this about my initial impressions about the device.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love the design of this phone, plus the feel in the hand. It&rsquo;s compact yet powerful. I also like what Samsung has done with Android. This is possibly the best compact smartphone out there. Not just with Android.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a couple of years with a compact phone, I have decided to jump to the other extreme. I have preordered the Galaxy S24 Ultra. I want to use a monstrous phone now. Though the compact phone was brilliant for general use, two issues have troubled me a lot.</p>
<p>The first is battery life. It barely lasted a whole day for me. If I use it heavily, I would need to juice it up towards the evening. With a bigger phone comes a bigger battery. I require a phone that lasts at least a day now.</p>
<p>The second is the smaller screen wasn&rsquo;t the best to read and write. Especially later. I felt constrained and generally preferred to read on my iPad and write on my iMac or laptop. I hope both changes with a larger screen.</p>
<p>I knew back then that Galaxy Ultra was the device I wanted next. I will have one next week.</p>

			 <p>Friday evening began promising and then just fizzled out. I had planned many tasks but couldn&rsquo;t get through to the majority. One big reason is that <em>I am shit tired</em>. My time at work is hectic. Worse, it is chaotic. So, each day leaves me mentally exhausted. Today was no different.</p>
<p>Not that I work long hours. Just the daily grind of finding clarity amidst the chaos, finding the right answers and the way forward sips the energy and drive from the non-office hours. Friday&rsquo;s are worse because there&rsquo;s the unspoken promise of recuperating through the imminent weekend. So, I simply give up on all the plans and sway along with my wandering mind.</p>
<p>Today was no different, as I signed the day off. With the hope that tomorrow, I regain the drive and cover for the time I lost.</p>

			 <p>I watched the <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech/">Rabbit R1</a> keynote for the first time, and I have to say it&rsquo;s an exciting device. What surprised me the most was the price! How can any AI-based device be launched at this price range? And that&rsquo;s when I looked at the specs. Behind all the funky-looking exterior, it&rsquo;s underpowered inside. Also, tells me most of the functionality happens in the cloud.</p>
<p>The makers have smartly called out that this does not replace your smartphone. It&rsquo;s a companion device. And that&rsquo;s where I have my doubts about R1. It might sell brilliantly at the beginning, which it already is, according to the reports. But I am afraid it will lie forgotten in the drawers for many.</p>
<p>An exciting, cute tech nonetheless. The question is, are we ready for an AI-only device?</p>

			 <p>I have uninstalled all the filler apps from my smartphone. There&rsquo;s no social network or news or video app. Yet I reach out for the device if it is around me. I won&rsquo;t do anything there. Open emails to find nothing new. Open some random website. Or worse just check if there are any notifications. This is pitiful. I need a filler activity that&rsquo;s better than swiping randomly on my smartphone.</p>
<p>A filler activity is the one I would do when I am not fully focused on something. While I sit in meetings where I am just a listener. While I wait for my food. While I start while my tea is brewing. Unfortunately, my smartphone continues to occupy such periods currently.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>For the past few years, Micro.blog has hosted this blog. Every year, I revisit that decision to verify if it still is the best choice for me. I did that last year. And I did the year before. Every time, I have decided to stick to this wonderful platform. Unlike earlier, when I made such decisions by listing pros and cons, the last two times I made it based on my experience of using the other services over a year.</p>
<p>I have recently read a lot of people revisiting their choices of platforms and thought I should share about my experiments. I had shared my views once <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/02/15/why-microblog-works.html">in 2022</a>. This post is for the experiments since then.</p>
<p>Before that, here&rsquo;s a quick note on how I give myself time to arrive at this decision. <em>I have never changed my primary platform</em>. I sign up for an annual plan with a service, set it on a custom sub-domain and use it for a full year. Sure, it&rsquo;s a costly option. But as the subscription ends, I have no doubts about my decision. Neither do I have any urge to switch platforms every time I see it discussed. Anyway, onto my experiments.</p>
<p>In 2022, I was fascinated by what Ghost promised as a platform. It was well-reviewed, polished and highly recommended. It suited the long-form style of writing I wanted to do more of. It had a built-in newsletter. I wanted all of that. The question was, can it become my primary blogging platform. A year of continuous usage convinced me it wasn&rsquo;t. Though I liked what it offered, it didn&rsquo;t fit my style of writing. I am very informal in what I write. Sometimes, it is heartfelt life stories. Other times, it&rsquo;s meaningless updates. More often, it&rsquo;s the latter. Ghost isn&rsquo;t a right fit for such posts.</p>
<p>For starters, it continues to need a title. And images. It wants me to play around with the metadata of the post. Before I can publish a post, all the bells and whistles distract me and I start to question if my words are worth all this polish. That&rsquo;s not the feeling I want when I am about to click publish. It limits what I can do with the styling. Even the paid plan has a very limited selection of themes. Plus even with all these limitations, it is pricey. I do not earn from my blog &ndash; so $9 per month paid annually isn&rsquo;t cheap.</p>
<p>Last year I picked up Write.as to experiment with. Unlike Ghost, its plans are simple &ndash; so I again signed up for an annual plan which unlocks all the paid features. Most importantly custom domain. I set it up as a place for my quick, unformed thoughts. It supports both short and long posts well. Plus it has got hands-down <em>the best editor to write posts in</em>. I could never write quick, short posts &ndash; it was that good.</p>
<p>But there are significant downsides that I cannot brush aside. Adding images to posts isn&rsquo;t easy &ndash; need to go to a separate place to do that. The published posts look clean, but soulless. The options for styling are extremely limited. An ability to extend the capabilities is almost non-existent. The selection of good themes is negligible. The biggest problem of all is the publishing workflow, especially writing drafts, which is very frustrating. Drafts are posts published anonymously. But publishing them back to the main blog isn&rsquo;t intuitive. The published dates get all messed up.</p>
<p>Also, I am not sure if the platform is in active development. Over the past year, I hardly saw anything change. I don&rsquo;t want to spend time on a platform that&rsquo;s ignored.</p>
<p>On both occasions, I cancelled my plan at the end of the subscription period and moved all the posts to Micro.blog. With redirects set automatically, it was as if the posts were always published here. I respect <a href="https://www.manton.org/">Manton</a> for being always supportive and for actively discouraging lock-in by simplifying moving in to or out of Micro.blog.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I had written last time while talking about why Micro.blog works for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]t suits well for both the micro and long-form posts. It has apps for all platforms that I primarily use Mac and Android. Quick notes are best made with the apps, especially so from smartphone. For posts that are long, titled, <del>Ulysses</del> iA Writer works perfectly well for me. No other CMS can ever work as well as a native application.</p>
<p>The platform is built on Hugo. And I love Hugo. (&hellip;) Building extensions in your templates is so easy, and I have gotten comfortable with it. Manton has added just enough around Hugo to make it even more useful ‚Äî the APIs, the apps, the social aspects, the open plug-in and theming systems and, the most valuable, its community.</p>
<p>Do I use all of them [smart features]? Of course, not. But the fact that one plan provides me so much over and above the basic blogging functionality is priceless for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of this has changed even now. I also haven&rsquo;t observed the stability issues that I see people complain about recently. May be I have just been lucky.</p>
<p>No surprise then, that Micro.blog continues to be my blogging platform of choice.</p>

			 <p>I will no longer syndicate my posts to any social network timelines, that includes Micro.blog. This is the last post that gets syndicated. I will follow all my friends only via RSS and interact through emails or native comments. If you are keen to know what I am up to, you can <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/feed/">follow the RSS feed</a>.</p>
<p>For some time now, I haven&rsquo;t been active on any social timelines. I simply <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2024/01/09/i-am-losing.html">can&rsquo;t keep up</a>. It doesn&rsquo;t serve the purpose if I don&rsquo;t contribute to the network and interact. At times, days go by before I respond to the mentions I receive and worse, I hardly ever reply to others' posts. Being passively around the timeline only adds to the subconscious burden.</p>
<p>I also want to minimise distractions with my presence on the internet to lend myself more chances to build the right routines. Anything and everything that causes even a hint of friction has to be out. Given my general lack of patience for the hustle of social networks, they had to be out the door first.</p>
<p>I want to simplify everything. The tools I use. What I read. The way I write. <em>Simple</em>, that&rsquo;s my word for the year.</p>

			 <p>I <a href="https://amitg.blog/self-discipline-is-a-paradox">have been thinking</a> a lot recently about self-discipline and doing things I love. I want to understand why I need self-discipline to make myself do things that I love. There can be two reasons for this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an inherent dichotomy between the things that I love and the things I want to believe I love. Maybe I don&rsquo;t <em>love</em> love journaling. Or meditating. But I want to believe I do. Hence, I need to fit these into my routine, or I just won&rsquo;t do it. On the other hand, I do love reading blogs and non-fiction. Or mysteries. So, I don&rsquo;t need a routine to make myself follow people&rsquo;s feeds. Or read books. If this is the case, how can I separate things that I love from those I want to believe I love?</p>
<p>Another reason might be that the things I love aren&rsquo;t easy for me to do. I haven&rsquo;t mastered how to meditate. Or to journal. They don&rsquo;t come naturally to me and hence, even a feeble friction &ndash; late nights or a busy work schedule or an unplanned travel &ndash; derails all my attempts to do any of these regularly. I need self-discipline to force myself to do such activities regularly (and patiently) as only through repetition will I master them. Only then would they start coming naturally to me.</p>
<p>I am yet to be convinced of the real reason. Maybe it is both; maybe neither. Whatever the case, I continue to force a routine on myself for I know of no other path to self-discipline.</p>

			 <p>I watched three movies over the weekend. I don&rsquo;t usually do this, but after <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2024/01/03/the-last-few.html">a hectic week at work</a>, I had to give myself some relief. Two of the three movies were absolutely (and surprisingly) brilliant. Another one was just a mindless filler.</p>
<p>The first was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23849204/">12th Fail</a>. Such an inspiring story told in a simple, no-nonsense manner. In today&rsquo;s phase of over-produced, over-dramatic, loud action movies, the plain narration was a treat. There was no ear-splitting background music and no unnecessary slow-motion effects. The life the movie was based on already had enough drama that it didn&rsquo;t need any additional <em>masala</em>. Plus the music from Shantanu Moitra was mesmerising, especially the track <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3ywlNiy0UNpjqI1pGckbf2?si=4d672d59979a41ce">Bolo Na</a> that plays in the film. A beautiful, uplifting movie that can be watched with family, something that&rsquo;s rare these days!</p>
<p>Next, we watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6495056/">Migration</a> &ndash; an unplanned rush to the theatre with the only intention to spend quality family time. And we did. A light, colourful movie with moments of hearty laughs. Of course, with a bucket of popcorn and coke. I always feel refreshed when my daughter has a wonderful time in a movie theatre. Watching her guffaw at the silliest of the jokes brings a big smile to my face. Today was no different.</p>
<p>With this much of the weekend spent on entertainment, I still had time for myself, for writing and lots of reading. I must be doing something right. I have a theory, but I am not ready to share it yet.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;Self-discipline is overrated. I should do what makes me feel good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just doing what makes me feel good makes me lazy. I need self-discipline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are the two extremes I hop between. I would love to be in the middle somewhere. Self-disciplined enough not to be lazy, yet allow myself space to do what I love. Is attaining such a balance a myth? And what <em>do</em> I love? What <em>does</em> make me feel good?</p>
<p>Is it anything that&rsquo;s frictionless or passive, like watching TV or clicking through YouTube recommendations? Or is it something that lends me a hollow feeling of achievement? Like reading random &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; posts that I have no interest in? It must be neither. It is both.</p>
<p>Irrespective of which extreme I find myself at, I subconsciously judge how I spend my free time. It can&rsquo;t be healthy. But I haven&rsquo;t yet mastered the way not to be self-judgemental.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I want to achieve. Be self-disciplined. To do things that keep me void of any guilt. But shouldn&rsquo;t those be the things that make me feel good? As a result, won&rsquo;t self-discipline make me lazy?</p>

			 <p>The last few days have been extremely hectic at the office for me. I want to get hold of things, but there just are too many threads to look after. I need some system of sorts &ndash; I know prioritizing and time-bounding the tasks has helped me in the past. Plus I have come across so many useful systems for getting more done.</p>
<p>But I, of course, still need a system that works for me. I am starting small &ndash; stitch a list of tasks, merge a few to shorten it, and finally get them lined up to be ticked off. My only concern at this point is I am adding a lot more tasks to the list than I am getting off of it.</p>
<p>My hope was things would settle down in a couple of days. I am afraid it&rsquo;s not going to correct on its own. Tells me something is inherently wrong with how I am managing stuff.</p>

			 <p>I came across this prompt a while back, which I had no opinion on. I wanted to attempt to elaborate my thoughts on it now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone looked at how you spent your time over the last year, would what they see as your priorities match what you see as your priorities?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I had set health and focus as my priority for the year. Even after starting the year well, I didn&rsquo;t spend enough time on any of those. What&rsquo;s worse is that towards the end of the year, I was numb enough not to attempt doing any of them.</p>
<p>The results are here to show. I am distracted. I am not in the best of my shape.</p>
<p>Is it time to set them as a priority again, then? Nope. It is time to discover why my attempts were derailed later last year.</p>

			 <p>I published less number of posts in 2023 (183) than in 2022 (346). Why did I write almost 50% fewer posts?</p>
<p>I gave up on the system that worked for me earlier. I didn&rsquo;t stick to any for long. I forced myself to write daily. But then I also let myself slack for a day. Before I knew it, I was missing repeatedly. I wrote daily. Then I didn&rsquo;t for months.</p>
<p>Does it matter that I wrote fewer posts? What if I wrote longer posts? Isn&rsquo;t more number of words better? Shouldn&rsquo;t I find out if I did?</p>
<p>It is, and it isn&rsquo;t. My <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/07/28/on-thinking-in.html">love for long-form writing</a> isn&rsquo;t hidden. I enjoy longer posts more. But if they come at the cost of not writing for a long stretch, I am not okay with that. I don&rsquo;t write research-heavy essays. I don&rsquo;t write in structured form. Writing regularly helps me distil my thoughts. I work a long post while I write, publish and discuss a thought through multiple micro-posts.</p>
<p>A downside is my tendency to publish micro-posts only as they are effortless. Even with these, I hold myself back as I do not want to post too many posts in a day. I realised this in 2023, and I reduced publishing micro-posts. And eventually, I stopped publishing any posts. I overthink, admitted.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t vacillate between these two extremes any more. There has to be a middle ground. I am okay with writing less but want to do it regularly. Give thoughts a chance to churn to generate the best ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extraordinary results are a matter of repeating ordinary actions over a long period of time. Start with ordinary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote from this week&rsquo;s issue of Mark Manson&rsquo;s newsletter came timely as I was already contemplating this in the context of my #writing. So. in that context, here&rsquo;s my plan of action for my writing in 2024.</p>
<ul>
<li>Write less in each sitting. Publish more posts.</li>
<li>No number of posts in a day is too many.</li>
<li>Miss a day, sure. But not two.</li>
<li>Any words are acceptable for a post. Even one. Write <em>and publish</em> that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would love to look back at my writing journey towards the end of 2024 and see at least 366 posts published.</p>

			 <p>Back from a week-long vacation, the first thought I had when I logged into my system after a couple of days rest was <em>I must have missed so much</em>. I wasn&rsquo;t wrong, of course. My feed reader and timelines were full of unread posts. I did what any sane mind <em>should</em> do - I marked all items as read and started fresh.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very unlike me. I tend to skim through the list and keep things to catch up on later and discard everything else. I simply discarded everything this time. I have learned from the past. I rarely catch up. The list stares back at me the psychological pressure rising with each day until I eventually mark everything as read.</p>
<p>I pre-empted that this time.</p>
<p>One entry missing from the list to handle this time was my email inbox. Surprisingly, HEY has that covered brilliantly. Nothing that&rsquo;s not of interest reaches my inbox anymore. After a period of indecision on the utility of HEY, I am hooked to the service now that it has solved my email problem.</p>

<p>Start with titleless posts as the base, making them first-class citizens. Stitch the design around that. And then add support for titles. People latched on to the microblogging phenomenon of Twitter and Facebook because they made posting interfaces frictionless. A simple textbox floated at the top of the timeline for quick thoughts to be posted.</p>

			 <p>After deliberating over whether to offer membership for my online creations, I decided to set up a <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/amitgawande">single One a Month tier</a>. The decision to set up a membership of any form was triggered by the recent realisation that led me to pull down Scribe- the realisation that my side projects cost me dear. Every month, the prices add up, and I eventually run out of motivation to keep going.</p>
<p>However, the step to keep it simple and affordable for people considering support is inspired by a <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/@/page/FzQB8gwtyZXZ2yq3">recent post by Manu</a> where he proposed changing the defaults on pricing the support.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 1$ part means you can set it up and forget about it because it&rsquo;s a low enough amount that won&rsquo;t make too much of a difference for the majority of people who are considering supporting online creators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a period now, I have had a Buy Me a Coffee page so that others can support my hobby projects. Many have, and I could not be more grateful. I have now rolled out a simple membership to cover the projects that <strong>need hosting and, hence, carry a monthly bill</strong>. The likes of Scribe. And Micro.threads.</p>
<p>With one membership, there are no complicated tiers. And no special rewards, either. Frankly, I could limit the number of members to ten as that&rsquo;s all I need to support my ongoing side projects. But I am keeping things simple for now.</p>
<p>However, in today&rsquo;s tumultuous world, one full of uncertainty, to expect anything in return <em>for my hobby projects</em> would be unfair on my part. No obligation, hence, on anyone whatsoever.</p>

			 <p>The recent discussions around social media platforms tire me. BlueSky. Threads. Mastodon. And whatnot. They are all the same. Trying to cash in on the lost interest in Twitter.

<p>When I joined Twitter, I cared zilch about how I should use it. Or <em>how I shouldn&rsquo;t</em>. That was a different me then. Now, I think a lot about how and how much I should use social networks.</p>
<p>I hold myself back out of fear. Fear of uncertainty. Fear of complexity. Fear of promises.</p>
<p>The fear won&rsquo;t let me get hooked to any social networks anymore. Syndicating posts from my blog is not going to do that either.</p>

<p>I believe Ulysses' overall better experience, both writing and publishing, attracted me to the app. I subconsciously moved away from iA Writer, never to return. Time to change that. iA Writer was the first writing app that I fell in love with. It&rsquo;s no surprise, then, that it continues to impress.</p>

			 <p>Every morning for the past few days, I plan to sit and jot down my thoughts sometime during the day. As the evening dawns and I sign off from my work without #writing anything, the weight of unpublished thoughts pulls me down. I console myself that there&rsquo;s still night to come. I would be surrounded by silence and calmness. No distractions with everyone deep asleep. The <em>perfect conditions for me to write</em>.</p>
<p>Even though, I <a href="https://amitg.blog/its-only-been-two-weeks-since-i-have-written-a-post-every-night-and-i-already">know very well</a> that waiting for such perfect conditions is futile. The fact that I haven&rsquo;t written anything these past few days proves the point again. I can never expect to get into the flow of writing if I wait for the conditions to be exactly right.</p>
<p>Seth Godin has succinctly captured this thought in his book The Practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do the work, whether we feel like it or not, and then, without warning, flow can arise. Flow is a symptom of the work we&rsquo;re doing, not the cause of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I write when I sit down and write. Not when I am <a href="https://amitg.blog/thinking-about-writing">thinking about writing</a>. I have identified a process that works for me. I need to stick to it.</p>
<p>But should I write even if I don&rsquo;t feel like writing? Hadn&rsquo;t I read someone recommend never to write when I am tired? What if I am tired right now? You know what? The lazy in me loves to listen to others when it suits him. I need to shut him down. I need not overcomplicate things.</p>
<p>I love writing. I need to write. If it means, at times, I need to force myself to stare at a blank editor with a blinking cursor, so be it. Word will flow.</p>
<p>Plus it stops me from feeling like shit.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2023/11/27/on-routines.html">On Routines</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2023/11/27/on-routines.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-11-27 23:22:30 &#43;0530">Nov 27, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As much as I love my routines, I have recently struggled to keep one. Although there are some that I regularly follow, I lack a daily routine of any sort, whether in the mornings, evenings or through the day.</p>
<p>I know the routines are essential, mainly to free up some mental space for the creative work. It <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-you-do-every-day-matters-the-power-of-routines-178592">makes sense</a> that &ldquo;regular work processes allows workers to spend less cognitive energy on recurring tasks, which can support focus and creativity for more complex tasks.&rdquo; I then find it surprising that I have a complicated relationship with my routines.</p>
<p>I wake up, sleep at fixed times, and have a chain of habits associated with the time after and before. But nothing else sticks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a time blocked for focused work. Or for my hobby projects like writing. I then wind down every day feeling frustrated not having achieved what I thought I would at the start of the day.</p>
<p>While ruminating over these struggles in my journal, I stumbled upon a realization. I cannot follow a daily routine because I lack a work-life balance. But unlike the pre-pandemic period, it is tilted much towards #life. Because I am always working from home, I surround myself with distractions while working.</p>
<p>My family, my pet and their stories. The apps on my iPad and my books. My home. All pry for my attention. And I am not strong enough to fight any of that for long.</p>
<p>When I visited the office, I had a clear separation of what I did and worked on while at the office. At home, that separation is difficult to attain. It&rsquo;s funny that this separation of space was considered important during the pandemic&rsquo;s early days. The only difference is that for others, it was not to get drained by work and leave some time for life. It is not to let my home life muddle in my work life.</p>
<p>This has had a predominant effect on my writing. I tell myself I can do it anytime, so I don&rsquo;t do it at <em>any time</em>. Why do I need a creative block marked in my calendar when I can read, write and think any time I want?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, given how lazy and prone to procrastinate I am, I do.</p>

			 <p>I witnessed a minor accident today that brought back memories of a similar yet contrasting incident I was part of a few years ago. A car brushed a motorbike parked at the roadside today, and the man sitting on the bike had a tumble. He cursed. The car stopped. The driver alighted. Sensing nothing as alarming, they laughed at the situation&rsquo;s futility in a somewhat anticlimactic moment.</p>
<p>What I faced all those years back was far from ordinary, though.</p>
<p>On a late morning that day, I was driving my regular route to the office. There is a section with many overpasses, and they always get busy during peak office hours. A safe driver, I had held my lane and stayed there. I don&rsquo;t usually drive fast, and I wasn&rsquo;t even that day.</p>
<p>And out of nowhere, a forward jerk and a crashing sound warned me something had bumped into my car from behind. I peeked into the rare view mirror and saw a man in the middle of the road, a motorcycle lying a few meters away. People crowded around him, some picking him up and others doing the same to his bike.</p>
<p>Like a good samaritan and fearing the worst, I parked my car to the side and strode, worried into the crowd that had ballooned to almost fifty.</p>
<p>A scruffy guy in his early twenties was standing at the centre, multiple people checking him for injuries. I was relieved to see him standing, moving, shaking himself off the dirt. At least my worst fears were unfounded.</p>
<p>And then, out of the crowd came a question that jolted me, <em>&ldquo;Kisne thoka isko?&rdquo; - who hit him?</em> Right away, I knew things could soon get worse than anticipated. I was rushing for answers, justifications, and truths for the bulging crowd on why I wasn&rsquo;t at fault.</p>
<p>Someone touched my shoulder and said, &ldquo;In bhaisaab ka gaadi hain&rdquo;. <em>It is this man&rsquo;s car.</em></p>
<p>I knew my justifications wouldn&rsquo;t work with this crowd. They wouldn&rsquo;t even give me a chance to tell the truth. A guy walked towards the sweating me. I fumbled, searching for the right first word. But before I could utter anything, I heard a voice. &ldquo;<em>Mera galti tha</em>. It was my mistake. I was driving fast, lost control of the bike and crashed into the back of this person&rsquo;s car. It wasn&rsquo;t his mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard a few audible sighs. The voice of a man who has just been in an accident and his admission of the mistake made the crowd lose all interest.</p>
<p>As the gathering started to dwindle, I breathed a sigh of relief. I walked to the guy and asked him if he was okay. I offered to take him to the hospital if he was hurt. He declined. Though scuffed at a lot of places, he was okay overall.</p>
<p>Strangely, a few people left were getting restless again and hurling enquiries at the guy. I felt a hand on my shoulder. A man in his fifties leaned and whispered, &ldquo;<em>Saheb tumhi nigha ata</em>. You should leave now, sir. You shouldn&rsquo;t have stopped at all. Things could have gotten so out of hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though I was stunned at that moment by the heartlessness of this stranger&rsquo;s advice, deep down, I knew his remark had some merit.</p>
<p>In a world constantly on the verge of annoyance and hostility, was staying back when I knew everything was fine a mistake? I didn&rsquo;t have the courage that day to find the answer. After all, #life had to happen.</p>

<p>It has never been my experience with iCloud - sync takes ages in the always-connected cloud world of today. Especially when I compare it with Dropbox and Google Cloud, the services that I use.</p>
<p>I am a big, big fan of Dropbox. The service has got the perfect balance of functionality and performance. <em>Everything just works</em>.</p>

			 <p>I have always disliked the apps that provide you with a 15-minute summary of the books, usually non-fiction books. Such services are reviewed well and people seem to be paying for them. For example, <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/">Blinkist</a>. Here&rsquo;s whom this service claims to be built for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for curious people who love to learn, busy people who don‚Äôt have time to read, and even people who aren‚Äôt into reading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get this. What&rsquo;s the fun in listening to a 15-minute summary of books? Even podcasts, they claim?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to not be into reading books. One isn&rsquo;t really missing anything if they don&rsquo;t read books &ndash; the information will find its way to reach them. Why, then, the farce of reading books through summaries?</p>
<p>With the rise of ChatGPT and likes, services now don&rsquo;t even want people to read articles on the web. For example, <a href="https://resources.arc.net/en/articles/8399405-arc-max">the latest update for Arc browser</a>¬†launched a new feature called 5-second preview where one can &ldquo;<em>press Shift and hover over any link to generate a summary of the webpage, without a single click</em>&rdquo;. This is not good as it can potentially kill people&rsquo;s (already dwindling) interest in visiting other websites.</p>
<p>Why are we so against any form of reading in the original voice?</p>

			 <p>Every day that I don&rsquo;t write makes writing again more difficult. I don&rsquo;t because I convince myself what I write next needs to be significant. <em>I don&rsquo;t have anything meaningful to talk about</em>. Why does it need to be meaningful? And meaningful for whom?</p>
<p>The most meaningful thing I do is live my life. Isn&rsquo;t everything happening to me, around me, of the most importance? Why won&rsquo;t, then, #writing about it be meaningful? It is to me and that&rsquo;s all that should matter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t write for readers to find meaning in what I have written. I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/10/08/why-do-i.html">write</a> to calm myself down. I write to focus.</p>
<p>No surprise then that every time I stop writing, I am more unsettled. The <em>restlessness</em> is not the cause of my block. It&rsquo;s the effect.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t know how to be social. I can&rsquo;t use the social media tools. I am a user of many. I don&rsquo;t use any. Or to be fair, I don&rsquo;t know how to use them. I would passively scroll through the timeline and yet not respond to any of the posts. Not that I don&rsquo;t want to. However, I don&rsquo;t know what to say. Or how to say it.</p>
<p>I feel awkward interacting with people I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s who an introvert is.</p>
<p>Even in real life, I take time to comfortably open up with others. I am that silent, awkward guy hanging around in a group. Not knowing who and how to talk to someone.</p>
<p>No wonder then I feel the same discomfort in the digital space. What troubles me is I just end up wasting time not using these tools in the manner they are supposed to be used. I don&rsquo;t benefit in any way by using the services.</p>
<p>So why am I even on these social media sites then?</p>

			 <p>Having gotten tired this evening of sitting idly at home, I decided to step out and roam aimlessly around my neighbourhood. Only when I got on the road did I wonder which turn I should take.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any goal in mind &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t, as I usually do, want to visit a cafe to read or write. Neither had I planned to meet someone. I just wanted to be out and surround myself with strangers.</p>
<p>There was a thought that I was pondering over from the book &ldquo;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43621841-the-little-book-of-stoicism">The Little Book of Stoicism</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A situation does not make us unhappy. Our judgements in the form of thoughts, opinions and interpretations make you unhappy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a profound thought. The very fact that I was tired of the commonness in a moment doesn&rsquo;t make me unhappy. When I let it eat me within, make me idle around the home aimlessly, stare at my smartphone as my fingers swipe on the screen &ndash; it is then that I am unhappy.</p>
<p>I decided I didn&rsquo;t want to let that happen. I want to give myself more chances of being out there. Give my #life a chance to not be monotonous. To observe something new. Find a new place. A new cafe on the block. A new road being paved. A buzzing park. Anything. Do something.</p>
<p>Just thirty minutes of roaming around today made me avoid the pain of doing nothing.</p>
<p>On my way back, I saw a man struggling to pull his motorcycle out of a parking lot. A wheel was stuck in a pothole and he could move it neither ahead nor behind. The helplessness on his face was palpable.</p>
<p>I stopped and asked him if he needed any help. Shocked at first and embarrassed later, he eventually gave in and accepted my offer. We managed to pull his motorcycle out from the pothole and him out of the troubling situation that he was in.</p>
<p>I walked home happily &ndash; I like to think he wasn&rsquo;t too unhappy either with the situation he had found himself in. A win-win for all involved I would say.</p>

<p>I control what I subscribe to. I am not a completionist, so I often mark all as read. I unsubscribe aggressively. Plus, like Om, I keep Newsletters far away from emails and use Feedbin.</p>

			 <p>I like rating things, though I don&rsquo;t do it often. I used to follow the standard star rating &ndash; rating stuff one of five stars. At times, I even went into the scale of half.</p>
<p>I slowly realized that it is not a good scale for how my mind works. It&rsquo;s too much work and the trouble of finding an accurate star that captures how I feel was enough to deter me from reviewing at all.</p>
<p>I am changing how I rate things now to a different scale &ndash; either I like it or don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s simpler and no longer a mental hurdle.</p>
<p>How about a third option in between when I neither like nor dislike something? A &ldquo;meh&rdquo; maybe? Well, that&rsquo;s why the second scale is not &ldquo;dislike&rdquo;. It says <em>I did not like it</em>.</p>
<p>If it is not a confident yes, it&rsquo;s a no. A two-scale rating covers that range.</p>

And as the scientists erupted in joy clapping and high-fiving each other on the screen, <em>so did the people around me</em>. It was a wonderful, wonderful moment to be part of.</p>
<p>Congratulations ISRO! üáÆüá≥</p>

			 <p>My daughter was writing in her journal today and casually asked me why she does not see me writing in my journal anymore. She was referring to a physical journal that she would see me writing in frequently a while back. I didn&rsquo;t have an easy answer for her, to be frank.</p>
<p>I said first that I write in my digital journal now &ndash; after all, I do have a Day One subscription, and it prompts me every day to make an entry. Do I always make one? Well, rarely. I haven&rsquo;t updated my journal <em>with anything meaningful</em> for quite some time now. Journaling isn&rsquo;t part of my routine anymore. So, I have slowly stopped doing it.</p>
<p>I was regular when I had made it my morning habit. The routine changed and so died my habit.</p>
<p>Leaving me in that deep thought, my daughter went on to scribble happily in her journal. Once she was done, she said, &ldquo;I love how I feel when I capture everything on my mind in these pages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even I want that now.</p>

			 <p>When I created <a href="https://scribe.amitg.net/">Scribe</a>, the idea was to make it work fully client-side &ndash; everything works from my browser. I intended to keep myself in check, to build only the simple, must-have features. It is good that I took that decision; otherwise, I would go down a rabbit hole supporting everything I want to. A lot is missing currently, I know. I have also heard a lot that others suggested.</p>
<p>But to be frank, I don&rsquo;t know where to start. I can&rsquo;t support many of the requests without a server-side component &ndash; for example, handling images. What&rsquo;s that one feature that is the most glaring miss? I have been using the editor for over a week without issue, other than a few styling fixes.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I am open to feature requests (and even pull requests) though. So, if there&rsquo;s a feature you want to see supported, do <a href="https://github.com/am1t/scribe/issues/new">create a new issue</a>.</p>

			 <p>I had <a href="https://amitg.blog/always-visible">recently quipped here</a> that we might see an increasing number of posts suggesting to other people what and how to blog. Here&rsquo;s what I said then.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Twitter and Facebook dropping in popularity, I expect blogging to attract a few new users as an outlet for their voice. And I also expect the pundits to pollute the internet again with their suggestions on the best ways to blog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, I went on to suggest what people should do while blogging. The irony, much?</p>
<p>My intention wasn&rsquo;t to do so, though. Instead, I wanted people to not worry about any of that stuff, especially while they are getting started blogging. Over the years, I have written about anything and everything. Hot sarcastic takes. Fiction. Technology. Personal essays. I wrote them all.</p>
<p>Many people suggest that one should stick to a specific area if they want more people to read what they write. It&rsquo;s better if that area is niche. Well, nothing kills a writer&rsquo;s motivation faster than the voice at the back of the mind continuously questioning if they should write what they are writing in the first place. If anyone will read them. That writer will bear that voice a few times but then realize it&rsquo;s too much trouble. And soon stop writing.</p>
<p>So, long back, I decided I wouldn&rsquo;t judge what I write or where I publish it. Nothing matters as long as I want it to be published. That includes who reads it. Or if anyone does at all.</p>
<p>I have accepted now that the only thing I control is the words. Everything else is external, outside of my control. So why worry about that?</p>

			 <p>Even though it is a holiday today, I decided to trudge outside the home. Alone, and unplanned. Just with a backpack, my laptop and my phone. For many, this might be very common. But it&rsquo;s not for me. I usually idle around at home. I might read or watch something. On rare moments, write too. But I would never leave the home unplanned.</p>
<p>Sure, I do very commonly go outside with my family. Or friends. But it usually is a planned trip to a mall, a restaurant or a resort. For dining, hanging out or just relaxing. But I rarely do any of those alone &ndash; <em>the me time</em>.</p>
<p>There was a time when I could get such time right at home. I could box myself in the study room and cut every distraction out. Be alone, get bored. That&rsquo;s the best way I know to focus on everything that I love to do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get the needed focus at home anymore. There&rsquo;s calm, and I spend quality family time. But I do that without any self-goal as such. The minutes and hours go by. Yet, I hardly get anything¬†done¬†that matters. Something that makes me feel good within.</p>
<p>You know that feeling when you are happy, yet something feels missing?</p>
<p>I realized this recently when I was away with my family on a weekend stay at a wellness resort. It was a much-needed break away from the hustle and bustle. I decided to carry nothing with me. No books. No iPad. No diary. I locked my phone in a drawer the moment we reached. My daughter, the extrovert she is, quickly found few friends and got busy playing. My wife had planned a few therapies and was away for a few hours. So, even though we went together as a family, there was a period when I was alone with nothing to do and no one to talk to.</p>
<p>And I absolutely loved every second of it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It reminded me of when this boredom was very common for me. I suddenly craved such a period of loneliness and the ideas that left me with. So, it was time to correct a few things at home.</p>
<p>My wife had recognized this uneasiness in me. Don&rsquo;t the soulmates usually do? She had been suggesting many things to pull me out of the lull. <em>Why don&rsquo;t you go out alone? Why don&rsquo;t you meet your friends? Why don&rsquo;t you go down and walk?</em></p>
<p>I ignored all those suggestions. Aren&rsquo;t we always told to spend as much time as possible with family? So, I always wanted to stay around the people I love the most.</p>
<p>But in doing that, I alienated the one person I should never have. <em>Myself</em>.</p>
<p>Today, I corrected it, and I intend to make it more common. Allow me to get bored through lack of anything to do. Or of anyone to talk to. So that I can listen to my mind and do what it wants me to do the most.</p>
<p>If these 500 words are anything to go by, I might feel at peace with my mind again.</p>

<p>This is a focused writing space with¬†an editor that <em>completely works on the client side</em>. What I write is auto-saved locally. I can save the same to Micro.blog as a draft to be edited later there. Or I can post it to go live on my blog. There is a word/character counter and dark mode. And it also works on mobile.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not the first post I have published with Scribe &ndash; I have been using this for the past couple of days, fixing all the issues, big and small. Now, you can also try it out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing else to explain. Just get writing and sign in to Micro.blog, if you like it.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t read a more frustrating book than <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53139064-the-eighth-detective">The Eighth Detective</a> by Alex Pavesi. It has a smart premise. Pavesi was aiming to attempt something pretty unique. But then I feel he got distracted by the lure of surprising readers. The twists and turns were too many to keep the book coherent. There are no characters to connect with. No story that captures your attention. The seven stories narrated by the lead character are silly. The twists are sillier. And are one too many. It was frustrating to see a clever premise wasted through controlled writing.</p>
<p>At the same time, I haven&rsquo;t heard many better narration performances than by Emilia Fox. She is extremely natural while voice acting in both stories and dialogues. I could visualize every character distinctly just through her voice.</p>
<p>The last time I was this impressed by someone&rsquo;s narration was when I listened to <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/04/17/i-cant-remember.html">Ray Porter narrate Project Hail Mary</a>. Absolutely fantastic!</p>

			 <p>Early mornings always play a significant role in my routine. I love the vibe all around during the dawn. The calmness. The silence. The hustle and bustle of morning service boys with their newspapers and milk packets.</p>
<p>The surroundings wake up around me, and I love to be the spectator.</p>
<p>Nature looks to be shrugging off the dormancy from the night before. Birds get busy early. Chirping. Waking each other up. Or already playing? Who can say? Trees sway lethargically with a smile, like a sane grandmother in a busy home. The breeze caresses me like a loving mother &ndash; I can almost fall asleep again.</p>
<p>Never a night owl, I couldn&rsquo;t stay awake beyond a reasonable time, even during my hostel days. Those were the days when staying up all night was normal. A sign of a happy student even. While my friends used to blast off into the night with their choice of rock music, I lay on my bed in deep slumber. Frequently, my friends and I had breakfast together &ndash; the only difference was that they were depleted on their way to bed, and I was chirpy post my deep sleep.</p>
<p>In the recent past, my morning routine has been hectic, not allowing me to live the calmness I so adore. Today I paused for a moment and stood looking out at the wakening surrounding.</p>
<p>A moment of life around. Of nothingness within. Of memories galore.</p>

			 <p>I keep my writing simple while conveying my thoughts. It is the most effective way that I know. I learnt this from all the people I enjoy reading online. But Derek Sivers has been the most significant influence.</p>
<p>There was a time when I liked to ornament my writing with unnecessary words. A lot of context. Too many adjectives. Metaphors.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do that anymore as it is unwarranted for my kind of #writing. I don&rsquo;t want to pen the most beautiful piece of prose. Or be creative with the use and selection of words. I write to convey my ideas and that needs just clarity. <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/i-am-not-a-writer">Manu says this</a> while sharing why he feels he is not a writer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What matters here is not the writing, is the communication. Is the exchange of ideas, and the sharing of experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I relate to this thought. As long as what I want to say is unambiguous, and is understood without trouble by the reader, my goal behind <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/10/08/why-do-i.html">why I write</a> is met. The length of the post or my vernacular does not matter.</p>
<p>I want my writing to sound as I do while I speak. <em>And I don&rsquo;t articulate. I talk.</em></p>

			 <p>Threads reminded me of why I eventually fell off the Twitter timeline. It&rsquo;s the same people talking about the same stuff they always do. The early adopters, the famous bloggers, and podcasters. The social media celebrities. They have a bubble of their own. They talk amongst themselves as you listen. You are not part of any community &ndash; you are watching a show.</p>
<p>Then there are the posts that are written mainly to go viral. The memes. The questions. The jokes. And the jokers. The social media diarrhoea.</p>
<p>These threads (pun unintended) garner the most engagement, which makes the algorithmic timeline bubble them to the top. Now, these are all I see. And I don&rsquo;t enjoy either of them.</p>
<p>The diversity of both the posts and the people is also why I love the timeline on Micro.blog. It&rsquo;s never the same people or the same type of posts that crowd the place. And if they do, I know how to correct that.</p>

			 <p>Recently, I have seen many people get nostalgic about Google Reader. The argument is that if Google Reader hadn&rsquo;t died, the internet wouldn&rsquo;t have been in the dire state it is today. As if the demise of Google Reader caused the rise of proprietary timelines of Twitter and Facebook. Unfortunately, it was the other way around.</p>
<p>Plus, Google Reader was a flawed, terribly designed, niche product only used by a handful of tech-savvy people. I say this even though I was a big fan of the product. It could never have survived in the form it was in.</p>
<p>Sure, web browsing does feel horrible today, as Tim Sweeney of Epic <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1674860397617111059">tweeted</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The internet feels increasingly broken. News sites are paywalled or account walled, Reddit is nag walled, Google search spams ads and SEO to the point of uselessness, and now Twitter is account walled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with all of it. But I don&rsquo;t think Google Reader could have addressed any of it. RSS, for sure, cannot. It&rsquo;s just a standard to simplify consumption. The problem lies at the source.</p>

			 <p>I am frustrated with my recent tendency to choose the easy option whenever an opportunity arrives. Watch rather than read. Read rather than write. Get tired doing both. And then sleep. I am doing this way too often these days. I have <a href="https://log.amitg.net/?date=2023-06-30#p1">made this my routine</a>. I am aware this behaviour isn&rsquo;t good. But I still do this.</p>
<p>Passively scroll through the news. Or YouTube shorts. And when I feel bad about my choice, I skim through my RSS feeds. Or newsletters. I attempt to fool my mind that I am reading the good stuff, following a good routine. I very well know that I am fooling no one. Especially not my mind. It continues to feel shit.</p>
<p>There was a time when I would take steps to correct the habits of bad choices. Move away from my smartphone. Uninstall apps. Or disable notifications. Track. Measure. Force me towards, or give me more opportunities to make better choices.</p>
<p>What pains me is I have stopped doing any of that, either. Every wasted day ends with a promise that I will start following a good routine from tomorrow. For that matter, routine of some sort, as I lack any at this point.</p>
<p>Weeks have gone by, but that tomorrow hasn&rsquo;t arrived yet. I am afraid it never will if I don&rsquo;t take measures promptly. Being aware is useless if I don&rsquo;t act.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to write for the last few days. Or has it been months? I have no idea any more. I did quip now and then. But to me, that does not count. Life kept me busy, and my inclination to think dries up whenever that happens. If I ain&rsquo;t thinking, writing I am not.</p>
<p>I hate this behaviour of mine. Why must I be in a routine to find time or energy to write? It isn&rsquo;t as if the words dry out. I just can&rsquo;t put them out.</p>
<p>A possible answer is that <em>I love my comfort zone</em>. Anything out of the ordinary and I shut my brain down. I can&rsquo;t think. I can&rsquo;t do anything that I routinely do. Or so I convince myself. I enter a shell waiting for things to get back to normal. Waiting for me to find my comfort zone again. And then, and only then, do I begin living again.</p>
<p>Until then, I find cheap getaways. Scroll through YouTube. Or news. Rewatching already watched shows. <em>Feel tired</em>. Sleep a lot.</p>
<p>Such a menacing beast this comfort zone is. It makes me feel comfortable with and in control of my life. Yet soon, the same control shackles me down to the routine. The lack of stress the routine brings suffocates me. Stagnates me. Am I then even alive any more?</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been watching Seinfeld&rsquo;s reruns recently, and one device has always puzzled me. The phone machine. It is a critical element in almost every episode and plays a central part in a few. And yet I have never owned such a device.</p>
<p>A landline was itself a luxury while I was growing up. Very few homes in the neighbourhood had them. Even we got it pretty late. I remember when we eventually did, our house became a switchboard, and we were the telephone operators‚Äîconnecting folks all over to ones in our neighbourhood.</p>
<p>We received calls at home and took the messages. Sometimes, my parents held the line while I, being the only kid in the house, ran to the neighbour&rsquo;s home to invite them to receive the phone call.</p>
<p>It was all fun, to be frank. It felt good to hear the stories after the phone call. No one left away without sharing what the call was all about. A few wanted to add more context to what we unintentionally heard on one heard by narrating what was said on the other. It all felt customary.</p>
<p>We never had an answering machine. There was no way to leave a message for us while we were away. So instead, I was the answering machine for others while <em>they</em> were away.</p>
<p>Also, I am not sure I would be comfortable using such machines. I could never convey the message on the spot in short. All I would say is, &ldquo;Call me back&rdquo;. What else can one say without rambling on and on?</p>
<p>So when I see these machines screw up the main characters' lives in the shows like Seinfeld and Friends, I only chuckle. You know, I have been an answering machine, and we tend to screw up.</p>

			 <p>Writing should not be boring. If that happens to me, it means that I am doing it forcefully or that I do it out of habit. Yet, in either case, I won&rsquo;t stop writing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t write because I <em>have to</em>. I write because I <em>have something to say</em>. That&rsquo;s why I cannot write on a schedule. Sure, I can sit in front of the screen and wait for the words to turn up. They generally do, which is why I have been a blogger for around 15 years. But I cannot force them to.</p>
<p>There are times when I write every day, multiple times a day. And then weeks go by, and I hardly publish anything.</p>
<p>This reminds me of a curious thought from James Clear. While talking about achieving mastery, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">he says</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mastery requires practice. But the more you practice something, the more boring and routine it becomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It makes me wonder - can creativity be routine and boring? I hope not. Maybe that&rsquo;s the reason one can never master an art form. They are always learning. The same applies to writing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t intend to master writing. All I want is to share my thoughts through words.</p>

			 <p>While working on <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2023/04/21/a-blog-no.html">my blog&rsquo;s recent redesign</a>, I decided not to display the date/time as part of the post. Sure, I am not the only one who does that.</p>
<p>Although debatable, I find that detail useless for my type of writing, and I was ridding the interface of every element that wasn&rsquo;t essential. I don&rsquo;t write posts which are relevant only to a particular period. I am not writing news articles that will go stale. Plus, if there&rsquo;s an article that forms the context for a post, I explicitly link to that.</p>
<p>So why does it matter when the words are written? I stand by and am even proud of every post I have written. Short or long. On the contrary, I don&rsquo;t want the age of the post to impact what it says. It&rsquo;s still me saying that. Just younger. It is the same reason I <a href="https://amitg.blog/what-do-i-call-the-entries-that-i-write-here">don&rsquo;t correct</a> my old posts.</p>
<p>I have also seen people put a disclaimer on old posts saying it may not reflect one&rsquo;s current views. Colin <a href="https://colinwalker.blog/blog/?date=2023-03-19#p1">puts such a disclaimer</a> on his older posts and writes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just because I may not think a certain way, however, doesn&rsquo;t mean that I can&rsquo;t be proud of what I have previously written ‚Äî some of it is among my best writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with Colin. But for the same reason, I don&rsquo;t want to put any such disclaimer. Isn&rsquo;t it obvious that one&rsquo;s perspective towards things changes over time? Why call it out, then?</p>
<p>I accept that not showing the date is extreme. After all, I still include the date in the source and RSS feeds. But removing a detail is the best way to determine if it is essential. And currently, I am all for a reset.</p>

			 <p>A few months back, I responded to Om Malik&rsquo;s thoughts on the importance of stream of posts on one&rsquo;s blog. Here&rsquo;s what <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2023/01/31/does-the-stream.html">I proposed</a> we bloggers should do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recommend stuff to the reader on our platform, our blogs. On our home pages. And around our posts. But instead of letting AI decide, let&rsquo;s curate these recommendations manually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have since wanted to update my website, my primary home on the web, to do away with the standard design principle for a blog. Why does every home page have to look a certain way? Pages after pages of reverse chronological lists of posts.</p>
<p>I recently quipped that blogs have made the web boring. That every blog looks the same. All themes are more or less the same. A slight layout change here. A margin or padding there. Varied columns. But all look the same to me. You know that you are reading a blog.</p>
<p>I wanted to stop doing that. I want to curate the experience for the readers. Worst case, for the one reader that&rsquo;s me. So, I have been working on laying out the structure for this space afresh<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A home page recommends a selection of posts. No page&rsquo;s a reverse chronological list. Even if a reader visits one that&rsquo;s supposed to be, for example, <a href="https://amitgawande.com/archive">archive</a>, they won&rsquo;t see a list. Every page allows a search and an option to visit a random post. A prominent nav bar allows navigation around every post. There are a lot of other minor touches sprinkled across.</p>
<p>Plus <em>there are colours</em>. Minimal doesn&rsquo;t mean black and white. Minimal can have personality. It does now.</p>
<p>Satisfied after playing around and iterating with the changes for a couple of days, I applied the layout to the site today. Once I did, I wondered if this space was a typical blog any more. As per Wikipedia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A blog is an informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not a diary. No reverse chronological order. And yet I don&rsquo;t care. To me, a blog is what a blogger wants it to be. And I am done with the stream of posts. So here&rsquo;s to a bold new start.</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I do maintain and actively publish at a traditional blog and the nav bar points to that. Irony much?&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <p>I have a fascinating relationship with Mondays. There&rsquo;s some charm to the first day of the week as if it dawns with a responsibility to set things right. With a new zeal not to carry the mistakes from the week gone by.</p>
<p>To follow the routine. To focus on the work. To get back to life.</p>
<p>With responsibility comes pressure. The pressure of all the things undone in the last week and pushed to the next. Pushed out with the hope that the first day of the following week would be different. Better. It never is.</p>
<p>I usually want to get back to all the right habits on Mondays. Why do so on any other day? In the middle of a week? Right? I remember we, friends, once had a running joke where we would answer any suggestion of starting something healthy with &ldquo;let&rsquo;s start on Monday&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Gym? <em>Let&rsquo;s start on Monday.</em> Stop eating junk food? <em>Let&rsquo;s start on Monday.</em> Read more? &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This habit of waiting for Monday to start something different, something good, has stuck with me. Funny how bad habits die hard.</p>

			 <p>I generally find it easy to write about meta topics around my writing process. Or platforms. Among the people I read online, the behaviour is common. At the same time, I&rsquo;m not too fond of these meta posts. All I am doing is convincing myself why the choice of a platform is the right one. No one cares about them.</p>
<p>Will I ever run out of places where I can write at? I won&rsquo;t. Can I ever have enough of them? Never. Should I write about all of them? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>Holding oneself back from writing about a particular topic is antithetical to the spirit of blogging, where no topic is beyond the bounds.</p>
<p>But writing about every experiment lends me a false sense of achievement. I write because I want to think better. I write because I want to improve my writing skill. Writing mindlessly about my experiments doesn&rsquo;t help me with either of those. Hence I don&rsquo;t write meta posts any longer.</p>
<p>Or so I think. Ironically, this itself is a meta post.</p>

			 <p>I came across this brilliant quote from Leslie Lamport ‚Äî &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re thinking without writing, you only think you&rsquo;re thinking&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s simple yet so meaningful.</p>
<p>Writing reinforces my thoughts. It won&rsquo;t be a stretch to say that I understand my thoughts only through #writing. Distil them. Before that, they are just fuzzy noises in my head.</p>
<p>While in school, my teachers would force me to write down what I learned to remember it better. We, students, were made to write chapters multiple times to learn them. But at that time, learning meant remembering things. Not grasping them. I wish someone had told us that writing helped us understand things better. I would have fallen in love with writing a lot earlier.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another analogy to Lamport&rsquo;s earlier quote: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re thinking <em>about</em> writing, you only think you&rsquo;re writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though I haven&rsquo;t written much for the past few days, I thought a lot about writing. Every day, I had a new idea to write about. Every day, I gave myself multiple reasons why I shouldn&rsquo;t write about it. Many ended up in drafts. Many had a painful death in my head. It&rsquo;s a terrible place to die for an idea. So I must let them out more often, in whatever ugly shape or form.</p>
<p>I often have such phases when for every inspiration on why I should write, my mind comes up with a hundred distractions about why I shouldn&rsquo;t. The only way I have known not to fall for the lure of distractions is through the routine of fixed time and place for me to write.</p>
<p>If I present myself, the words find a way out. Thinking doesn&rsquo;t do that. Writing does.</p>

			 <p>It is the phase when I reevaluate my use of all the services I am subscribed to. Of course, my email client is one of the key ones on the list. I was an early Gmail account holder and have been an ardent user since then. But when Gmail got old, I never loved email. It got boring and tiring.</p>
<p>Recently, I realised that I love sending and receiving emails. But I wouldn&rsquo;t say I like Gmail.</p>
<p>iCloud was handling my custom email domain. But as I am not all in on the Apple ecosystem &ndash; with my Android and Linux &ndash; the experience with iCloud Mail is terrible. In short, I had to find a new solution for my personal and custom email domains.</p>
<p>I started with a trial of Fastmail, and I was unimpressed. No doubt, the email service is brilliant. It&rsquo;s no-nonsense and has everything that an email power user would want. Nothing more and just the way an email service should work. I, however, am not a power user. Nor do I love the experience that the typical email services provide. I needed something different to rekindle my love for email.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I was reminded of HEY. The last time I tried it, I loved the service but didn&rsquo;t need it. Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2020/07/05/215535.html">what I wrote</a> while ending the trial.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All in all, HEY is a brilliant service with a fresh perspective towards the way we use our emails. It can potentially enliven the email offerings from all the players, just the away Gmail did back in 2004. But I don&rsquo;t face the problem it is trying to solve; I have no use for all its groundbreaking features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do I think I need it now? Well, to be frank. I still don&rsquo;t. But I am falling in love with email again, and HEY&rsquo;s unique take on how email should be done should help me stay en route. So, here&rsquo;s to a new start for emails.</p>

			 <p>I enjoy <a href="https://amitg.blog/evening-walks-are-cheerful-again">my evening walks</a> with Snoopy. This guy continues to get all the attention from folks I have never met. I often hear someone call out his name, run to him, play with him and walk away with a smile. <em>Completely ignoring my presence</em>. As if I don&rsquo;t exist. Such is the charm of cuteness, I believe.</p>
<p>He has also made new friends. He knows where he will find them. He walks to the place and waits for them to come to him. These are the regulars.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a corner towards the end of our walk that both of us adore. It&rsquo;s usually quiet. A cold breeze always flows through. It&rsquo;s neither too light to expose us nor too dark to hide us. I make sure we halt there and sit next to each other. Nothing in my hand. Nothing on my mind. <em>Nothingness</em>. A bare moment of a void. Amidst the bustling #life.</p>
<p>And I like to believe Snoopy feels the same. Unperturbed. Many people walk by, but no one disturbs us. Maybe they acknowledge the tranquillity we feel.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s walk was no different. And yet was slightly different. After sitting through the quiet moments, I realized it was a full moon in the sky. Pink moon. It looked big, majestic. My hand went to my pocket to pull my smartphone out as it often does. I wanted to take a picture of the magnificence I was looking at. I wanted to capture the moment.</p>
<p>How futile was the thought? The day there exists a technology that can capture such moments of calmness, their significance will dwindle. Such moments are rare; they need to be lived and felt. And in that feeling, in that rarity, lies their essence.</p>

			 <p>Sometimes, all that matters is to hit that publish button. Do not worry about whether the subject makes sense. Or whether the way it is written does.</p>
<p>Whether there are too many adverbs. Or whether there is too little to say.</p>
<p>When words not published burden my mind, it is worthwhile to make way for them. To make them public. To not let them sit idle as a draft. I won&rsquo;t return to them anyway. After all, writer&rsquo;s block boldens itself in the drafts section.</p>
<p>So to unshackle my mind, I pick some draft and publish it in its form. What&rsquo;s the worse that can happen? It would just be another terrible post in the ocean of terrible posts on the internet.</p>

			 <p>Am I writing enough? Am I writing too much? I cared a lot about these two questions in my early blogging days some 15 years ago. At that time, blog pundits filled the internet with suggestions on the posting schedule or the posts' length. With Twitter and Facebook dominating soon, all those suggestions became futile.</p>
<p>As online presence became a popularity contest, a burst of short meaningless quips became the norm.</p>
<p>Throw more at the wall, and something will stick.</p>
<p>I could never play the social media game. It needed the zeal to always stay connected. I instead felt burdened by the pressure of participating non-stop. No surprise, then, that I kept writing on my blog. A lot less frequently, but I did.</p>
<p>With Twitter and Facebook dropping in popularity, I expect blogging to attract a few new users as an outlet for their voice. And I also expect the pundits to pollute the internet again with their suggestions on the best ways to blog.</p>
<p>Let me spill the beans. There isn&rsquo;t one.</p>
<p>Write anything. Write anytime. Write anywhere.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about followers. Don&rsquo;t worry about likes and reposts. There aren&rsquo;t any. Some see this as a limitation &ndash; <a href="https://amitg.blog/today-i-began-reading-writing-is-my-drink-by-theo-pauline-nestor">I find it liberating</a>.</p>

			 <p>What do I call the entries that I write here? Notes? Posts? Thoughts? Or does that even matter? This is my blog, a space, <a href="https://amitg.blog/whats-this-space">as I noted earlier</a>, for the &ldquo;quick posts journaling whatever is at the top of my mind&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t call them quick posts because they are less formal. Instead, they are less formal because I want them to be. Because I write them as short, quick posts. They need not be correct. They need not be <em>corrected</em>.</p>
<p>Manu <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts-on-an-unpolished-note">wrote recently</a> about how he dislikes editing old blog content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A] personal blog can and should be a representation of who you are at different points in time. We change, we grow and our thoughts and ideas grow and change with us. And it&rsquo;s important to have testament of that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I, too, am firmly in Manu&rsquo;s camp. If I were to <em>improve</em> my old posts, I would never write anything new. The ideas are shitty, and the way I wrote them is shittier. Nevertheless, I still stand by all of those posts. Sure, I may not endorse any of those views today. But they are the views of my younger self.</p>
<p>The world around me has changed over the years. So has the world within me. It is only natural then that how I look at and understand the world has evolved too.</p>
<p>I recently observed my writing may have gained <a href="https://amitg.blog/i-read-a-post-today-that-i-had-written-around-15-years-ago">correctness at the cost of courage</a>. Colin had <a href="https://colinwalker.blog/blog/?date=2023-03-15#p4">an interesting thought</a> responding to the post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about it being a lack of courage, rather an increased reticence stemming from a low-level, underlying fear that now pervades the web.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it the fear of being wrong that has made me change what and how I write? Sure, that too. Whatever the reason, I am not the same self I was a few years ago. Why, then, should I ever correct what he thought and wrote? It helps neither the reader nor me.</p>

			 <p>I couldn&rsquo;t write anything for the last couple of days. Or instead, I feel I haven&rsquo;t written anything for quite a while. But that&rsquo;s not the case. I have written a lot more than I did a few months back. Why do I feel then that I haven&rsquo;t been productive enough?</p>
<p>Is it because I have spent long hours at work and overworked myself empty? Is it because I have wasted a lot of time after work? Or is it both?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel good when I overwork &ndash; it leaves me with no energy to do anything else. It also leads to a need to unwind, forget all the routine stuff and spend time doing nothing meaningful. Watching YouTube. Scrolling through timelines. Sleeping long hours. Or catching up on shows that I wouldn&rsquo;t have watched otherwise.</p>
<p>After the hard, long work, don&rsquo;t I deserve a bit of relaxation? Sure. But at what cost?</p>
<p>I hate the process of getting back to a good routine. I need to work twice as hard on bringing things back to normal. Get the focus back on health - physical and mental. Walk. Exercise. Meditate. Read. Write. Listen to music. Sleep sane hours. Live with family. Live.</p>
<p>My life is balanced on four legs: family, work, hobbies, and health. I am stable if I give them equal attention. If any of these engage me more, my life wobbles for balance. I look for temporary support. Mindless fun lends me momentary respite. But before I know it, I am back to the struggle.</p>
<p>I know I must get my life settled onto the four legs again. Work <em>at work hours</em>. Spend time with family. Lend time to me, to my hobbies. Focus on health.</p>
<p>Do all of these. Just enough to feel in control but not so much to feel overwhelmed. The struggle begins today.</p>

			 <p>Get to the point. I remember those words every time I write anything.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is to focus on how I begin my posts. Matthew Dicks <a href="https://matthewdicks.com/beginnings-matter-a-lot/">reminded me</a> about the importance of this today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Focus on the first thing you write, say, or sing. Spend time making the absolute best decision about those first few things you are going to express. Never forget their importance to everything that will come after.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was (and still am) bad at this aspect for years. I circle what I want to say before I say what I want to say. Over years of writing, I got better at this. I come to the point quicker now.</p>
<p>I feel frustrated when I see some of the most personal stuff with an interesting premise get lost in need of setting context. Many writings need context setting. Research papers need context. Thesis. How-to Manuals. And on and on.</p>
<p>But a personal blog does not. Sure, some stories need a build-up; take the reader along the ride. But most don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>On the other hand, does there even need for an &ldquo;effective way&rdquo; of writing anything personal? It&rsquo;s personal, after all. Individual. There&rsquo;s no correct way of doing it. It&rsquo;s a matter of style.</p>
<p>But what counts is not to lose the reader before I arrive at the point. So begin strong.</p>

			 <p>I watched <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kuttey">Kuttey</a> yesterday &ndash; what a terrible letdown. Given the list of artists as part of the cast and crew, I had such high expectations. But the skill of being a competent storyteller cannot be faked. It tried too hard to be cool, &ldquo;new age&rdquo;. Every frame screamed that it was inspired by the style of Guy Ritchie or Tarantino. Or even Bharadwaj&rsquo;s own Kaminey.</p>
<p>What the Jr. forgot is it isn&rsquo;t the style that made these directors what they are.</p>
<p>Everybody was trying too hard &ndash; even the seasoned actors looked uncomfortable playing the part. A short run-time of 90 minutes felt too long, even though the screenplay was fast-paced. I kept moving ahead scene after scene because I knew exactly how it would play out.</p>
<p>Barring the last 15 minutes, hardly any part catches your attention. Sigh! Such sheer waste of talent.</p>

			 <p>I read a post today that I had written around 15 years ago. Reading my words from yesteryears, especially from my early days of blogging, reminds me every time how fearless I was in expressing what I had in mind. Not everything I wrote made sense. But it wasn&rsquo;t bogged down by a fear of correctness.</p>
<p>Correctness of idea. Of language. Of grammar. Of words.</p>
<p>Is my #writing susceptible to that fear now? I hope not because, to me, it needs to be free-flowing. Sure, I am more alert to the mistakes in my use of the language. Or of words. But that&rsquo;s bound to happen naturally over years of reading and writing.</p>
<p>This reminds me of a nice quote from an Indian actor I respect, Pankaj Tripathi. He was talking about how fame and money have changed the artist in him. An artist, he said, is much more courageous and adventurous when they are new and lack money. Their experience, popularity and earnings make them powerful but timid.</p>
<p>I believe the same applies to one&rsquo;s experience with writing words. What I gained in correctness, I likely lost in courage.</p>
<p>So, which version of the self do I enjoy reading more? I like to believe that my writing has improved over these years. I am no master, but I am not an amateur either. Even though I am not the same fearless blogger from the past, I don&rsquo;t mind this slightly mindful version of myself.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One productivity hack I have read the most often is just to get started. Not to wait for inspiration or motivation. Not to procrastinate. Even with writing, or any art form, many often allude to the importance of blank canvas.</p>
<p>Stare at the page; one&rsquo;s mind will soon start filling it up with colours. Or words, in my case.</p>
<p>It has worked for me, too, for the last few weeks. The posts eventually happen when I make myself available in front of the laptop. With me travelling and visiting my cousins for the last few days, no surprise they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It was a welcome and <em>much-needed</em> break. I visited Mumbai, a place that I have a love-hate relationship with.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I love spending time with my cousins. The togetherness lends me a reset when I can forget all the stress and burdens of daily #life. Over the food we love and the memories that we chatter about. As time passes, the animated environment gives way to moments of real connection. As individuals find corners where they catch up on others' lives, I get surrounded by mumbles. But soon, as someone invariably gets hungry, everyone regroups, and the surroundings get filled with laughter again. This cycle continues throughout the day and late into the night.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s more comforting than spending time with people you bond with.</p>
<p>But then I hate Mumbai when I need to visit the city. It&rsquo;s too lively for my liking. Everyone&rsquo;s moving too fast. Every place is too crowded. No one has time to pause. And if I do, I face a lot of glares from the Mumbaikars. This includes my cousins too. <em>Why the hell will you do that - stop?</em></p>
<p>Some cities want you to pause and absorb their essence. Mumbai is not that city. It wants, <em>needs</em> you to match up with its speed. I struggle to do that. And I struggled this time, too. I returned home exhausted, drenched with the pressure of meeting the city&rsquo;s high lifestyle standards.</p>
<p>As I lay tired in bed, there was a moment when I attempted to push myself to publish something. Anything. But I have already conceded that this place won&rsquo;t follow a schedule. This place isn&rsquo;t a journal that I need to update daily. This place isn&rsquo;t a newsletter that needs to stick to a schedule. This place is my blank canvas.</p>

			 <p>I attempted to watch Netflix&rsquo;s new docuseries &ldquo;MH370: The Plane That Disappeared&rdquo; - and it&rsquo;s absolutely terrible. It gives focus to too many characters, goes all over the places and never returns back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s the story they want to tell. It&rsquo;s not what happened to the plane or who is responsible or even how it affected the people related to the passengers on-board. It tries to do all of it and does half-assed job at each.</p>
<p>I would recommend listening to the podcast episode on this topic by <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1oWeqQp4wW88wGD6ka8fqa?si=9LAZb3LYQrSs_kWdIfbvlg&amp;app_destination=copy-link">Stuff You Should Know</a>. They do a far better job at explaining the mystery than this supposed to be well-produced documentary by Netflix.</p>

			 <p>I had heard a folktale as a child that I still love. The morale it narrates is loosely translated as &ldquo;an entire tub full cannot retrieve what the drop took away&rdquo;. But the real takeaway from the tale was to be wary of one&rsquo;s instinctive reactions.</p>
<p>The spontaneous reactions taken in anger are as instinctive as instinctive can get. In that sense, anger is destructive. Rebounding from the aftermath that an angry reaction leaves behind is no painless task. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much one attempts to recover what was lost; the scarred mind cannot be easily healed.</p>
<p>Because anger scars both people, even the one who gets angry.</p>
<p>Hence I have moulded myself to not give in to the instinct when angry. I remind myself that my brain is muddled, and the best action I can take is to walk away and take a few deep breaths. It avoids ruining the remaining day for the other person and me.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t recover. Resist.</p>

			 <p>Today got as frustrating as the working days can get, shaking my confidence in my capabilities to the core. As I signed off for the day, I was left numb.</p>
<p>I toiled hard, but the circumstances fought back stronger. Key people went on unplanned leave. Approvals got delayed. Core systems faced unplanned downtimes. Folks got under undue pressure, and they began rubbing it off others.</p>
<p>The last one on the list of unfortunate events above is the worse. I hate when people do that.</p>
<p>Work one gets assigned can be delegated. Shared. Pressure shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>I am generally a lot more organized while handling my tasks with a clear goal for the day. But it gets frustrating when people pollute <em>my day</em> with <em>their</em> priorities. When they devalue my time because they can&rsquo;t value theirs.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s even more frustrating is that in a corporate world, there&rsquo;s just no way out of this at times.</p>
<p>As the day progressed, I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of tasks left untouched, the tasks that I should have worked on instead. The third day running of missed daily goals and the list keeps piling up.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed, tomorrow dawns better. That I manage to put my head down and pull my messed-up productivity out of the rut.</p>

			 <p>Silence is golden. Amidst friends, it is not.</p>
<p>It was Holi today, and I was surrounded by friends or people I knew once as friends. Yet there was hardly anyone I could walk up to and converse with without things getting awkward pretty soon. I knew then that some threads were broken within us. Some memories were lost. Some part of me was forgotten.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t be too self-critical by blaming myself. Such has been the #life for the last few years that there has hardly been time to peer beyond the bounds of the close family.</p>
<p>The pandemic locked us in our houses. And we forgot what we had left out.</p>
<p>I have been attempting to come back to normalcy slowly. It was exactly a year ago when I reconnected with my extended family. My cousins. It was the same occasion as today when I&rsquo;d welcomed them home. We&rsquo;d made some of the best memories and relived them again today.</p>
<p>Memories. Such a remarkable aspect of our lives this is. Say it aloud, and many would come rushing at you, leaving you drenched with giddiness.</p>
<p>Many did come rushing at me today. Memories from yesteryears when I had spent some wonderful moments with these people around me. But instead of leaving me giddy, they left me wretched. Miserable. Angry that I let the threads break. Break they did because friendship needs holding on to &ndash; the tighter you do, the stronger it grows.</p>
<p>I aim to correct this - I won&rsquo;t remain silent when I meet these folks for Holi the next year.</p>

			 <p>I knowingly broke a streak today &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t upload a photo as part of a monthly challenge because I didn&rsquo;t connect with the prompt. I was contributing anyway just for the sake of contributing &ndash; photos are not something I enjoy. I love taking photos, but I am not a master photographer. So why even try doing something daily that I don&rsquo;t enjoy?</p>
<p>So neither didn&rsquo;t I click a snap nor upload it.</p>
<p>I am also extremely tired today to spend any time writing significant nightly updates. So today, a quick observation will have to do.</p>
<p>I do not enjoy maintaining streaks. I do not enjoy taking photos without purpose. When tired, I cannot write anything profound. Or I cannot write. Period.</p>

			 <p>I have too many hobbies or interests that I want to undertake, much more than my schedule allows. I enjoy reading articles from the feeds/newsletters I subscribe to, reading/listening to books, interacting with social media posts, writing and coding on small projects. Even if I club the first three above as reading, it leaves me with many options. I am not even counting the unplanned movie show or wish to doodle. Today I decided I want to address this.</p>
<p>As I scoured the internet (mainly Reddit and YouTube) to find the solution to this not-so-uncommon problem, one suggestion I kept hitting against was to reduce the list. As Cal Newport <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf_UVP_z47Q">suggests</a>, I should have a primary and a secondary hobby. Anything more than that and &ldquo;the overhead counterbalances the value the activity brings.</p>
<p>So what do I want to get rid of?</p>
<p>I do not think reading is something I can stop doing. I enjoy reading this, that and everything. After many trials, I have finally arrived at an effective setup for my reading process. Someday I will go into the details of this setup. But overall, I do not want to eliminate any of that.</p>
<p>Is writing even a hobby anymore? I do this as part of my daily routine and a winding down activity. I need not find time for this. I already have. And hence even this ain&rsquo;t a problem.</p>
<p>So how do I juggle everything I want but haven&rsquo;t got time to pick? The search for a solution continues.</p>

			 <p>Someone reading <a href="http://amitg.blog/today-i-began-reading-writing-is-my-drink-by-theo-pauline-nestor">my yesterday&rsquo;s post</a> might think I hate interacting with folks online. Or don&rsquo;t want people commenting on my blog posts. That&rsquo;s not the case. Rather, through these interactions, I have clarified my thoughts.</p>
<p>Whenever I publish posts online, it is with an acknowledgement that I will receive reactions from people who follow me. I welcome that. But <em>I</em> want to control where and what form of remarks to entertain.</p>
<p>I want to learn from others' experiences. Or sometimes, I specifically ask for people&rsquo;s input. The <a href="https://amitgawande.com/notes">notes</a> (&ldquo;micro-posts&rdquo;) are often doing exactly that. These are the posts that I want to make reach as many forums as possible. I am a strong proponent of including ways for people to respond to you right below your posts. Here&rsquo;s my suggestion from not so long ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you write a blog and are interested in conversing with your readers, do include a link for the reader to do so right below your every post. I would love it if every blog post had a way for me to respond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But then there are those words that don&rsquo;t deserve hot takes or quick thoughts when I share something extremely personal. Or when I write something pretty close to my heart. When I am the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>These posts are open to me. And to those few who make an effort to follow and read them with patience. I don&rsquo;t want to make it easy for people to respond to the trivial aspects of the post. I want to interact with people on such posts, not garner reactions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thin line between the two, reaction and interactions. The former is <em>fleeting and individual</em>. The latter is <em>enduring and mutual</em>.</p>
<p>Email best enables the latter, so I love receiving responses through email. The person sending it doesn&rsquo;t expect an instant reply and tends to collate all their thoughts before hitting send. The conversation can go on for days. Not be ephemeral; die down because there&rsquo;s new stuff to react to.</p>

I don&rsquo;t remember the last time when a sample of a book attracted me so much that I purchased it right away. I connected deeply with the experience and struggles that Theo was sharing about her writing journey. Or specifically how she found her writing voice. Of course, her struggles were far more severe than mine, given her profession as a storyteller, working for many publications.</p>
<p>This specific passage had me nodding all along.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main problem was that on most topics I had no opinion whatsoever, and if I did have an opinion, I was so worried what others might think of that opinion I could barely remember what my opinion was in the presence of another human.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I strongly resonate with Theo&rsquo;s struggle. I read from many people who confidently opine on anything and everything they read or hear. But they don&rsquo;t just stop there; they also sound confident and unambiguous. They know what they want to say. They have found their voice to say that.</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, vacillate between being too assertive and too feeble. &ldquo;What others might think&rdquo; is the biggest hurdle in writing for introverts and overthinkers like me. While I write, I am already thinking about the comments or feedback I will receive. Or worse, am I worried I wouldn&rsquo;t receive any?</p>
<p>In that regard, this space is safe. I know I won&rsquo;t receive instant feedback on anything I write here because none of these posts reaches a place where responding is easy‚Äîa timeline with some way to reply. I haven&rsquo;t enabled the option to comment, either. I write only the stuff I am not expecting any interaction on. Because when I do that, I always think about the reader first, which is ineffective. Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/05/24/193000.html">what I observed</a> about this behaviour around a year ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are reined back by the voice ‚Äî you write <em>for</em> someone else. The response you expect from your readers provides you the lead. You write not what you like, you write what you think your reader likes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A year since, and I still struggle with this. Does that mean I don&rsquo;t like interactions or don&rsquo;t want any feedback from the readers? <a href="https://amitg.blog/interaction-not-reaction">That is not the case</a>. But I want to find my writing voice first without the added pressure of anticipating the reader&rsquo;s reaction.</p>
<p>I am going to use this space to achieve that.</p>
<p>To you, that one reader who has stumbled across this space and wants to respond or connect - <a href="mailto:reply@amitgawande.com">you are welcome to do so</a>. As much as I dread responding to quick comments, I <em>love</em> to take time and respond to people via email.</p>

			 <p>I have stopped using YouTube on my phone for quite some time now. Even my iPad and laptop, I use it very carefully. I do not like what it has become, especially the home page. Google&rsquo;s aggressive recommendations and creator&rsquo;s ability to game it have made it home to clickbaity and idiotic content.</p>
<p>Google wants to make YouTube addictive, and I <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2019/12/26/070000.html">want to fight back</a>. Here&rsquo;s the way that worked for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I either access the video directly (if I know what I want to watch) or browse my Subscriptions page (when I don‚Äôt know what to watch). The home page is useless without history turned on. And so are other recommendations. Trust me; you do not want them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, Google has managed to ruin the subscriptions screen too.</p>
<p>As if the recommendations for sensational videos weren&rsquo;t bad, Google found another way to spike engagement or our addiction to the app - shorts. I have been vocal about <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/07/15/as-far-as.html">my dislike</a> for this form of content.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that Google seems to be aggressively pushing it on creators, making it more profitable in some manner. Now my subscription page is full of short videos, with no way to filter them out.</p>
<p>The high-quality videos are getting lost in this drivel of mindless shorts, even from the creators I respect. I do not know how some of the most intelligent minds are ok with this. I have seen this play out to written words &ndash; the long-form essays are lost amidst the hot takes and rants on social timelines.</p>
<p>Google has done the same to the last sane space on the platform. I can now simply get rid of my usage of this platform altogether.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Google, and thank you!</p>

			 <p>Caring for a kid and a puppy while home alone is not easy. With my wife out to the office, today was the day when I had to do exactly that for the first time. It has left me completely drained. It isn&rsquo;t easy to write freely in such a state.</p>
<p>I try to focus on my thoughts, but my mind is half-sleep, waiting for me to slide down the bed. I know it won&rsquo;t take much time for me to go into a deep slumber. Everybody around me already is. My mind asks me <em>why can&rsquo;t I</em>.</p>
<p>Today also lent me a period of loneliness in the afternoon while my daughter and Snoopy were fast asleep. I worked and read in peace, which has left me with a lot of budding ideas to chew on. I thought I would meditate on one throughout the day and put my thoughts in words, but the current state of my mind won&rsquo;t allow that. Ex-yawwwwnnn-hausted!</p>
<p>Though weary down to my core, I still love such a day. Any lone &ldquo;me time&rdquo; I can steal from my routine is worth its weight in gold. But alas, such moments have become rare.</p>

			 <p>I have written spontaneously in this space for the last few days. Sure, there&rsquo;s a schedule to it, but no structure. I show up at a fixed time and type away all the thoughts at the top of my mind. Most often, it&rsquo;s a single thought that&rsquo;s clouding my mind. But there are also days when I write about a few thoughts strung together. Then, as I begin writing on a particular day, I have no clue what I will write about, just like today.</p>
<p>I looked at the blinking cursor, and no thought jumped to the fore. Everything was mundane. Not something that I felt strongly enough to put into words.</p>
<p>It made me realize how difficult it is to be spontaneous while #writing. I had once noted in my diary that <em>spontaneity in writing is priceless</em>. It is. But it is not natural to me. The train of thought that passes by as I try to stitch the words together makes the job tad more complicated. Before I am through with an idea, my mind is already wandering to the other, more alluring one. I, then, write about neither.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have turned into a planned writer. I usually have a skeleton clear in my mind about what and how I want to say. The planning at times makes me numb.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t the case when I began writing and publishing on my blog. I was an instinctive writer then &ndash; when an instinct hit me, I got rolling. I wrote till the time permitted, and the thoughts flew everywhere. I had a vague idea of what I wanted to comment on. Precisely what and how were determined as I typed along.</p>
<p>The posts I wrote then sure weren&rsquo;t the best of my works.</p>
<p>Yet I want to find that writer within me again. <em>He was fun</em>. Next, lend him my experience from writing over these years. He will bring the ideas, and I will bring in the sanity. My anticipation for this space is to be that playground.</p>
<p>I hence append the note I had made. Spontaneity in writing is priceless. <em>Just be prepared</em>.</p>

			 <p>After three weeks of <a href="https://amitg.blog/i-have-always-carried-a-clean-shaven-face-yet-i-often-want-to-sport-a-beard">bearing the beard</a>, I shaved it off today. That act felt nothing short of tearing it apart from my face. These three weeks have elevated my respect for those who regularly sport a beard. Maintaining this beast ain&rsquo;t easy. It grows willy-nilly. And twists and twirls. And bites the face. And scratches the lips. And pokes the nose.</p>
<p>I was done enduring all of that.</p>
<p>Even that wasn&rsquo;t easy to do at home, either. The beard struggled with the face. The razor struggled with the beard. And I struggled with the razor. Cleaning the mess the mayhem left behind was no less than cleaning up a crime scene. It took a toll on my morale. I needed a nice warm shower to get back to my #life.</p>
<p>I am past my fascination for a beard.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the clean-shaven me felt much less burdened, as if the beard weighed kilos. With <em>the weight of the beard off my face</em>, I walked more throughout the day. A nice morning walk. And a long evening stroll around the neighbourhood. I paused at a coffee lounge and sipped my coffee slowly. It felt good not to share it with my facial hair.</p>
<p>For a Monday, today was also unexpectedly productive. I could focus on work better. I do need to improve my way of closing tasks at hand. I like to be particular. I have my way of building a list and ticking the tasks off the list. Though it works for me, I have stopped doing it. It is time to bring out the notepad &amp; the pen and place it on the table again.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an update on the <a href="https://amitg.blog/i-had-almost-decided-that-i-would-not-publish-anything-today">meta concern</a> from yesterday. Matt <a href="https://discuss.write.as/t/billing-issue-while-upgrading-to-pro/8367/6">responded</a> to my support request and has generously extended the trial by a week while he finds a fix for my payment issue. What that means is blog is up and running as before.</p>
<p>I am happy I didn&rsquo;t have to give up on this beautiful writing interface. Sure, the issue isn&rsquo;t resolved yet. But I hope Matt finds a solution before this trial period runs out. After all, the problem isn&rsquo;t unique, and I assume it has a standard, tried-and-tested solution.</p>

			 <p>I had almost decided that I would not publish anything today. My blog got unpublished as the trial ran out, and I felt frustrated that I couldn&rsquo;t get help from anyone from the platform. I still am. Can I trust a platform if it can&rsquo;t guarantee support and get the working of basic functionality right?</p>
<p>But I am not letting this #meta concern break my streak of publishing the thoughts. Life updates have to wait as I publish another meta update.</p>
<p>I have undone most of the configurations and have set up the redirects. Setting things up with a trial account as if it were a fully working project was a mistake. But then, I didn&rsquo;t expect basic functionality like payment to fail <em>for a paid service</em>.  International payments are hard; I am surprised the platform didn&rsquo;t hit this problem earlier.</p>
<p>I wonder if I even want this update on my blog as I write this. When I started regularly publishing at this place, I thought the posts would be more personal. A slice of my life. But then, I had also said this space has no structure. No throughline. It contains what is at the top of my mind.</p>
<p>Venting my frustration about the platform is that today. So that&rsquo;s what I publish. I hope things sort out before I sit down for tomorrow&rsquo;s session. Another chance to set things right.</p>

			 <p>We had guests at our home today early in the morning. Usually, I would get a lot flustered when there&rsquo;s an unplanned visit. Not today, as these are the guests that I generally look forward to meeting in real #life. And the meeting we had. It started with lots of chitchats about nothing in particular. Chitchats are usually that, aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>We followed it up with a brunch, all delicacies of our choice and liking. Home delivered. A movie screening with popcorn at home. Winding the fun down with fresh mango ice cream. Everything was sprinkled throughout with lots of chatter and laughter.</p>
<p>I love such pleasant mornings when you meet folks you enjoy spending time with.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this messed up my routine thoroughly. I didn&rsquo;t do anything that I had planned to do. A couple of projects have been pushed to tomorrow. Some planned study time with my daughter got delayed. I hardly spent time alone with myself as there was none left. I didn&rsquo;t exercise; I screwed up my diet. I hardly read anything &ndash; the streak, alas, is broken.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a streak that isn&rsquo;t broken yet is spending the time before bed staring at the cursor blinking in this space. That I enjoy doing, and I am glad I didn&rsquo;t miss it even on a day like today of messed up routine.</p>

			 <p>I thoroughly enjoyed <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt24516518/">Vaalvi</a>, a Marathi dark comedy thriller. I don&rsquo;t remember the last time I laughed out this loud while the characters in the movie handled one serious situation after another. I wasn&rsquo;t laughing at the idiocy of the film or the characters; rather, <em>the movie wanted me to laugh</em>. Therein lies the brilliance of this film.</p>
<p>Is it perfect? Absolutely not. But it&rsquo;s an intelligent film. Sure, it has moments where it leans towards absurdity. But if you recognise the tight budget for Marathi movies and ignore such rare moments, you can enjoy even the absurdity thoroughly.</p>
<p>I wish this movie was more readily available. Do watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm0s7r3kRKw">the trailer</a> &ndash; I am sure you will enjoy it.</p>

			 <p>There is a sudden rise in minimal blogging engines that claim to have simple, no-nonsense writing interfaces. I guess many developers realise there is no point in fighting the big platforms like WordPress and Ghost on the features they are pros at. Strip out everything bloggers do not want and call that a simple system. But it is difficult to be simple and still attract users &ndash; you can&rsquo;t roll out the same features WordPress has, just in black and white.</p>
<p>As I have noted in a couple of #meta posts till now, write.as does it well. It has got a brilliant writing interface and a wonderful default reading experience. It is not minimal. It is <em>just pleasant enough</em>. And it is in this restrained form that it achieves simplicity and yet looks and behaves aesthetically to appeal to users.</p>
<p>In quest of going minimal, many systems strip out the polish off the features they provide. They look ugly. To me, it matters how the systems look. If where I write doesn&rsquo;t give me a pleasant vibe, I may not visit the place that often. I am picky about the fonts in the places I read stuff at. Flaunting system default fonts is not my definition of simplicity.</p>
<p>A simple system is not one that makes and gives no choices. Instead, it makes bold, opinionated choices.</p>

			 <p>It was a wonderful morning today &ndash; I spent time reading and #writing a lot. Nothing public. I made a journal entry in Day One after almost a month. And read a few posts from the read-later backlog. As I browse social timelines daily, I come across many excellent articles that I push to be read later. The list, though, continues to pile up. In my read-later queue are articles going back years which I know I would never reach. But they stay there, forgotten.</p>
<p>I do not like this and wish I would improve on both &ndash; make private journaling and reading from my feeds &amp; queues more regular. However, I recently found brilliant services for this.</p>
<p>Given my love for Day One, I was psyched to read the recent update of it being <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/introducing-day-one-web/">available on the web</a>. It makes the service even more accessible. I made today&rsquo;s entry from the web interface itself, and I was pleasantly surprised to see how clean the experience was. With the feature still in Beta, though, the developers have warned of the possibility of losing the data. That&rsquo;s not something I would like; hence I logged off immediately. But I do see the potential.</p>
<p>I am enjoying using <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a> (also in Beta) as my read-it-later service. It has everything I want - support for subscribing to RSS feeds and newsletters. However, the most significant benefit is its integration with Readwise (<em>duh, of course</em>). So my highlights from the articles are regularly presented along with those from the books on Kindle. I love the experience Reader provides and wish to use it more.</p>
<p>I find it funny, though, that it is not my smartphone that I enjoy doing either of these tasks. Instead, the smartphone continues to be a distraction, something to be kept feet away from myself while reading or writing. That is all.</p>

			 <p>I watched all four episodes of <a href="https://www.netflix.com/in/title/81617079">The Romantics</a> today. I loved the first two that documented the early life of Yash Chopra and the Yash Raj Films. I especially enjoyed the references to the early 90&rsquo;s movies &ndash; especially the music. That was also my biggest gripe with the docuseries &ndash; it just didn&rsquo;t speak enough about Yash Chopra&rsquo;s taste in music. And <em>his love for lyrics</em>.</p>
<p>I remember listening once to Javed Akhtar on how valuable the lyrics, the words, and the poetry was to Yash Chopra. &ldquo;If music is the body of a song, lyrics are its soul,&rdquo; Javed Akhtar had said. Yash Chopra understood that.</p>
<p>So as I got nostalgic while listening to all the songs from the yesteryears &ndash; Waqt, Kabhi Kabhi, Silsila, Chandni, Darr  &ndash; play in the background, I wished the makers of The Romantics had spent a whole episode just on his appreciation and quest for good music. There are so few Indian directors left who still value music as a core identity of movies. Yash Chopra was one of them.</p>

			 <p>Somedays are <em>frustratingly</em> productive, leaving me drained to the core. I am that today. What started as a routine day gradually turned into a busy nightmare as it went along. The only positive is that it was productive. I did everything that I had planned to complete in the morning, and then I did some more. I also checked off a couple of unplanned but priority tasks that got added to my list.</p>
<p>I am not fond of such a level of productivity. Not that I don&rsquo;t want to work. <em>I love working</em>, especially when that work involves any amount of coding. The more complicated the problem, the better I feel.</p>
<p>But I have found over 17 years of working that such productivity levels aren&rsquo;t sustainable. They leave me exhausted, needing that much more of a downtime and cool-off period. I would prefer consistently efficient days to the occasional burst of high productivity.</p>
<p>That said, there is some innate pleasure in such productive days. As I wind off the day well spent today, there is a smile of satisfaction on my face. Could I push some work to tomorrow? Sure. But it becomes difficult to pull away once I am in the flow.</p>
<p>One would think that years of experience at work make you immune to such bouts of focus. But there is no negating the drive for productivity. Especially for someone who loves what he does. <em>Someone like me</em>.</p>

			 <p>I have always carried a clean-shaven face, yet I often want to sport a beard. Sure, I frequently keep an unkempt stubble. 2-3 days of facial hair is my look when I am not meeting someone. But if we are going out, I shave. Or if we are expecting guests at home, I shave. And if I see a tired me looking back at me in the mirror, I shave. Keeping a beard hence has not been easy for me.</p>
<p>I inherited this clean look from my father, who he shaves daily without a miss. That is part of his morning routine. <em>A cup of tea can wait</em>. I have rarely seen him with stubble, let alone a full-grown beard.</p>
<p>Yet, as I write this, I carry a week&rsquo;s stubble on my face today. I am pretty certain that I want to grow a beard this time. There is a fad amongst men in India to keep a <em>well-trimmed</em> beard. And that last part makes me nervous. It is not easy to keep a beard. It takes effort to maintain it. The beard needs attention. It needs grooming. I know because I already feel itchy after a week without shaving.</p>
<p>I know there are oils and beard washes to help with the discomfort.</p>
<p>But I ask myself, why put myself through all this trouble? Why not just go with what I know and am more comfortable with? Am I ready to pay the price of experimentation on the face? Well, time to find out tomorrow.</p>

			 <p>The weekly report from Digital Wellbeing on my phone informs me that the daily average screen time was 20 minutes less than last week&rsquo;s. And I am pleased to see that trend has been downwards for the last few weeks. I uninstalled YouTube from my phone a few weeks back, which is one of the key reasons for lowered usage.</p>
<p>YouTube sucks away time without you noticing. The best way I know to control this beast is to not be available to you. The web app is a pain enough to not be distracting. So just get rid of the app from the phone and get your time back.</p>

			 <p>We are enjoying the walks around the neighbourhood with Snoopy. With this guy getting all the attention, it makes our evenings joyous. He is the favourite among my daughter&rsquo;s friends. And they all are his best friends. He enjoys running around and walking along with them. Neither of them can get enough of the other. The goodbyes are sad; none of them wants to go back home.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t even converse with him. He can&rsquo;t tell them anything. Yet you would commonly hear the phrases &ldquo;he is tired now&rdquo;, &ldquo;he wants you to run&rdquo;, and &ldquo;he is saying <em>slow down</em>&rdquo; as they play along. It is heartening to see the friends unable to talk to one another yet understand each other so well.</p>
<p>I had another realization today. Since we <a href="https://amitg.blog/with-snoopys-last-vaccination-done-today-was-his-first-walk-around-society">started walking Snoopy</a>, I have been a lot social in general. Not swiping, committing and liking on my smartphone. But social in real #life. I have met and talked to many old friends with whom I had lost touch. And <em>I love talking to people</em>.</p>
<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t I do that when I went on my walks alone? Well, for one, I always had headphones in my ear. So the only interaction we friends had was a nod of acknowledgement. Another reason was none of us had any topic to make us pause in our steps. Now we do.</p>
<p>Will this continue? Who knows. But I want to enjoy these cheerful evenings as long as they last.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s only been two weeks since I have written a post every night, and I already feel off if I do not sit down to write as the people around me sleep. This has been a nice routine. I feel relieved that I publish something every day. I was very close today to skipping writing. A brief moment ago, I was extremely sleepy. Then I needed to record one observation.</p>
<p>Even while doing nothing, walking around the house is enough to freshen me up. Putting me back in the mood to get back to the routine. And once I am in the zone, sleep doesn&rsquo;t disturb me. It&rsquo;s only a brief moment of weariness that I need to fend off typically. That I need to overcome it to sit down at my regular place.</p>
<p>And then the words start flowing.</p>
<p>What also helps is I have marked a corner as my #writing place. Every day, <a href="https://am1t.writeas.com/late-to-bed-and-late-to-rise">at a fixed time</a>, I sit down and start typing on a blank page. Today, I tried writing at a place which wasn&rsquo;t my regular corner. I failed. I was distracted by sounds. Or <em>the lack of regular sounds</em> in my corner.</p>
<p>The moment I returned to the writing place, the process became easier.</p>
<p>Being productive writing only at a particular place/time or in a particular environment isn&rsquo;t sustainable. But it&rsquo;s a hack that works for me and might help pull me out of the writing slump.</p>
